Due to rounding (to one decimal place), percentages may not add to exactly  100%. Data from 2019/20 to 2022/23 include practitioners on the temporary pandemic sub-registers. This affects some percentages.  We refine our data collection and reporting each year so data may not directly correlate across annual reports. The report’s supplementary data tables, available at www.ahpra.gov.au, are the source for some of the statistics cited. Other statistics  are drawn from internal reports. The ‘Most common types of complaint’ graphs in the National Board reports are based on the main reason for a notification.  For definitions of words and phrases, refer to the list of common abbreviations and the glossary. Throughout the report, the term  ‘podiatrist’ refers to both podiatrists and podiatric surgeons unless otherwise specified. The appendices are available online; they contain more information about Boards and committees. You will see photos of Ahpra staff, members of National Boards and committees, and participants in National Scheme meetings.  We thank everyone who agreed to be photographed for this report.  ===== PAGE 3 ===== 3 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 Tables and figures Tables  1.

The National  Scheme regulates the 16 registered health professions.  Every decision we make is guided by a nationally  consistent law passed in each state and territory – the  Health Practitioner Regulation National Law. A Ministerial  Council made up of all of Australia’s health ministers  oversees the scheme. The National Boards set standards for registration,  develop regulatory policy and guidance, and make  regulatory decisions about concerns raised about  registered health practitioners. While public safety is our priority, we also have an  important focus on the health workforce. The objectives  of the National Law include: •	 ensuring that only health practitioners who are  suitably trained and qualified to practise in a  competent and ethical manner are registered •	 facilitating workforce mobility across Australia  •	 facilitating high-quality education and training  •	 providing culturally safe health services to  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples •	 facilitating the rigorous and responsive  assessment of overseas-trained health  practitioners •	 facilitating access to services provided by  health practitioners •	 enabling the continuous development of a  flexible, responsive and sustainable Australian  health workforce. Core regulatory functions Professional standards National Boards establish registration standards, codes  and guidelines for health practitioners. Accreditation We work with accreditation authorities and committees  to ensure that graduating students are suitably  qualified and skilled to apply for registration as health  practitioners. Registration We ensure that only health practitioners with the skills  and qualifications to provide competent and ethical care  are registered to practise. We publish the national online  Register of practitioners so that the public can access  important information about their health practitioner. Notifications We manage complaints and concerns raised about  the performance, health and conduct of individual  health practitioners in all states and territories except  New South Wales. In Queensland, we jointly consider  notifications with the Office of the Health Ombudsman  and manage those referred to us. Compliance We monitor and audit registered health practitioners to  make sure they are complying with Board requirements. National regulation The National Scheme is a vital part of the Australian  health system.  Ahpra and the National Boards are responsible for the  registration of every practitioner in the registered health  professions across Australia.  In most states and territories, we also handle  notifications about registered health practitioners.  However, this process is different in New South Wales  and Queensland. New South Wales Complaints about registered and unregistered health  practitioners’ conduct, health and performance are  assessed and managed by 15 health professional  councils supported by the Health Professional Councils  Authority (HPCA) and working with the Health Care  Complaints Commission (HCCC). Ahpra has a role in accepting mandatory notifications in  NSW and referring them to the HCCC. Queensland The Office of the Health Ombudsman (OHO) receives  concerns about registered and unregistered health  practitioners. All concerns about registered health  practitioners are jointly considered by OHO and Ahpra  and a portion of them are referred to us to manage. Health complaints organisations Ahpra and the National Boards are professional  standards regulators. Health complaints organisations  (HCOs, also known as health complaints entities or  HCEs) can handle complaints and provide outcomes  on a wider range of issues. We work with the HCOs to decide which organisation  should take responsibility for each complaint or concern  that is raised about a registered health practitioner. A list  of HCOs is available at www.ahpra.gov.au/Notifications/ Further-information/Health-complaints-organisations. Independent ombudsman The National Health Practitioner Ombudsman (NHPO) and Privacy Commissioner provides an independent  ombudsman, as well as privacy and freedom of  information oversight of the National Scheme, the work  of Ahpra and the National Boards, and the administrative  processes experienced by practitioners and the public. Our purpose  Safe and professional health  practitioners for Australia Our values Our vision Our communities have trust and confidence  in regulated health practitioners Achievement Collaboration Integrity  Respect 6 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24  ===== PAGE 7 ===== 7 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 Introduction Towards 1 million practitioners  The National Scheme has a core focus on ensuring a  safe, high-quality health workforce that can be accessed  throughout Australia. At 30 June, Australia had 920,535  registered health practitioners, an increase of nearly 5%  since last year.  We have been working hard to get new international  practitioners registered faster and safely by  implementing changes in response to the Kruk review.  These included making identity checks easier, opening  a second assessment centre for nurses and midwives,  reviewing English-language requirements, and  developing fast-track registration pathways for specialist  medical graduates and other priority professions. The growth in internationally qualified health  practitioners is strong, with 48.4% more new overseas  practitioners gaining registration than last year.  Improvements to our registration processes reduced  the time it took to assess a complete international  application from an average of 60 days to 33 days. The number of health practitioners per capita continues  to grow steadily and there are now 3.4 registered health  practitioners for every 100 Australians. This is positive  news, although a challenge remains in the geographic  distribution of skill and specialisation of practitioners  around the country so the community is able to access  healthcare when they need it.  Leadership and collaboration  Two landmark rulings were made under the National  Law this year. In September, the first custodial sentence  was imposed on someone falsely claiming to be a  registered health practitioner. And in October, a tribunal  ruled against a doctor over his discriminatory, culturally  unsafe, insulting and offensive behaviour towards a  Yuggera, Warangoo and Wiradjuri man. The doctor was  reprimanded and disqualified for 12 months. This outcome  reflects changes made in 2022 to strengthen the National  Law to eliminate racism from Australian healthcare. We remain vigilant about new models of care, which  bring both benefits and potential risks for patient safety.  Issues such as medicinal cannabis and vaping cut across  regulatory areas and we have been working with the  Therapeutic Goods Administration to develop cross- regulatory solutions. Emerging services that are driven in  part by social media trends, such as cosmetic procedures  and weight-loss drugs, often fall outside of traditional  healthcare models, and when people are harmed it is not  always reported to us. In response, we have bolstered  our work to draw on multiple sources of regulatory data  to gain earlier insights on emerging issues that may  require a strengthened regulatory response. Working with other agencies helps us to act faster  to prevent future harm. We convened a number of  fora and symposia during the year to explore how to  improve data and information sharing among regulatory  agencies, and to bring together agencies and services  to address other pressing issues such as racism in  healthcare, practitioner distress during the notifications  process, and family and domestic violence. Improvements and initiatives The final group of changes in the Health Practitioner  Regulation National Law and Other Legislation  Amendment Act 2022 were made this year. And  in September, the Health Practitioner Regulation  National Law (Surgeons) Amendment Act 2023  enacted protection of the title ‘surgeon’ when used  by medical practitioners. Helping consumers to get to the right place when they  have a concern about their healthcare has been the  focus of a joint initiative with the Australian Commission  on Safety and Quality in Health Care. Working closely  with consumers, we published a suite of resources for  health practitioners and consumers to improve the  consumer experience of making a complaint. We were pleased to see increased traffic to our  website after launching a new design. The updated  pages include improved information for consumers and  practitioners, including how to find the right place to  report a concern. It is now easier to search the Register  of practitioners and there was a 36.0% increase in  register use compared with last year. Farewelling our CEO After 15 years, Ahpra CEO Martin Fletcher announced his  intention to step down in December 2024. Martin was  appointed as the inaugural CEO of Ahpra in 2009. He has  worked tirelessly to establish and lead an internationally  respected regulatory scheme for health practitioners. He  will leave Ahpra well placed to face the challenges of the  future in protecting the public and enabling access to a  highly skilled and safe health workforce in Australia. In closing, we thank Ahpra staff and National Board and  committee members for their commitment, efforts and  achievements throughout an exceptionally busy year.  And we thank the registered health practitioners around  Australia for their continued dedication to safe, high- quality healthcare. Mr Martin Fletcher  Chief Executive Ofﬁcer,  Ahpra Ms Gill Callister PSM Co-convenor, Forum of National  Registration and Accreditation  Scheme Chairs Chair, Ahpra Board Ms Rachel Phillips Co-convenor, Forum of National  Registration and Accreditation  Scheme Chairs  Chair, Psychology Board of Australia  ===== PAGE 8 ===== Growing the workforce  Making it easier for  internationally qualified  practitioners to register  The Australian health workforce is growing but national  shortages persist.  In December, National Cabinet endorsed the 28  recommendations of the final report of the Independent  review of Australia’s regulatory settings relating  to overseas health practitioners. The review was  undertaken by Ms Robyn Kruk AO and is referred to  as the Kruk review. Ahpra is the lead or has a key role  in several of the Kruk review recommendations. We  welcomed the findings of the review and immediately  began work on reforms to make it simpler, quicker and  cheaper for internationally qualified practitioners to  practise in Australia. In response to the review, Ahpra and relevant  National Boards:  •	 removed requirements for overseas-based  applicants to present in person for identity  checks in Australia before their registration  can be granted  •	 opened a new purpose-built centre in Melbourne  for the examination of the clinical skills of  internationally qualified nurses and midwives –  this means shorter wait times for overseas-trained  nurses and midwives to sit their exams so they  can work in Australia sooner  •	 completed a review of English language  standards (and health ministers approved revised  standards on 14 June)  •	 made significant progress on a fast-track pathway  to registration for specialist international medical  graduates (see the box), and public consultation  on a draft revised registration standard for  specialist registration was carried out in June •	 began scoping work on fast-track pathways  for other priority professions beyond medical,  as well as work to provide greater flexibility to  meet other requirements such as supervision  and English language skills. What drives practitioner  retention and attrition? Understanding what motivates health practitioners to  stay or leave their profession is an important aspect  of workforce sustainability and quality. Analysis of  registration data from 2014 to 2023 showed that the  overall number of registered practitioners increased in  that period, but the retention rate declined, highlighting  concerns about workforce stability.  In June 2023, nine National Boards agreed to participate  in the Workforce Retention and Attrition Project (WRAP).  A survey was sent to 145,120 health practitioners and  18.0% completed it in full.  Most respondents said they intended to stay and  provided insights into what motivates them in their  work. Factors that predict whether a practitioner will  stay or leave, such as work hours, years of experience,  gender and age, were also examined. A paper detailing  the findings has been submitted to a peer-reviewed  journal and is likely to be published in late 2024, when  the findings will be published on Ahpra’s website. Expedited pathway for  medical specialists We have begun working to establish an expedited  specialist pathway for specialist international  medical graduates (SIMGs) in four priority areas:  anaesthesia, general practice, obstetrics and  gynaecology, and psychiatry.  Once it’s in place, the pathway will provide  an additional route to specialist registration  for SIMGs who have qualifications considered  substantially equivalent or based on similar  competencies to an approved medical specialist  qualification in Australia.  SIMGs with a qualification that is listed as eligible  for the pathway will be able to apply directly  for specialist registration without requiring a  specialist medical college assessment. For further  information, see page 20. 8 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24  ===== PAGE 9 ===== Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  Health and Cultural Safety Strategy We again made significant progress in implementing the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health and Cultural  Safety Strategy 2020–2025, now in its fourth year. Eliminating racism from  Australian healthcare  In October, the ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal  delivered a landmark ruling against a doctor over  discriminatory and offensive behaviour, supporting the  goal of eliminating racism from Australian healthcare. The doctor has been prohibited from providing any  health service and cannot apply for registration for  12 months, after admitting that his conduct towards  ophthalmologist Associate Professor Kris Rallah-Baker,  a Yuggera, Warangoo and Wiradjuri man, was culturally  unsafe, insulting and offensive. This outcome is in line with changes made in 2022 to  strengthen the National Law, which were supported  by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health  Strategy Group. Culturally safe notifications  process The medical and nursing and midwifery Indigenous  National Special Issues Committees have been  established, made up of Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander practitioner and community members. These  committees have been making decisions about  regulatory matters affecting Aboriginal and Torres  Strait Islander Peoples. International regulatory  excellence team award  In September at Salt Lake City, the Aboriginal and Torres  Strait Islander Health Strategy Unit (HSU) and Ahpra  were recognised by the peak international regulatory  body Council of Licensure, Enforcement and Regulation  (CLEAR) for a Regulatory Excellence Team Award for  their work to ensure culturally safe practice in Australia’s  health system. The award requires the team or agency  to have demonstrated exceptional leadership, vision,  creativity, results and outcomes above and beyond the  regular functions of the job or expectations, and beyond  what is normally achieved. Increased visibility The HSU committed to a year of visibility for their  strategic work in 2023 to share progress towards  eliminating racism in healthcare for Aboriginal and  Torres Strait Islander Peoples. To fulfil this commitment,  a number of abstracts were submitted and accepted to  present at Indigenous health practitioner and regulatory  conferences, in addition to having exhibition booths  providing profile and engagement opportunities with  stakeholder groups.  Indigenous leadership at the  Combined Meeting In October, during the week of the referendum on the  Voice to Parliament, the National Scheme Combined  Meeting and the first in-person Aboriginal and Torres  Strait Islander Health Strategy Group was held in  Naarm. The meeting featured an impressive line-up  of Indigenous keynote and guest speakers. Dr Janet  Smylie, Professor Lisa Whop, Dr Clinton Schultz, Dr Ali  Drummond and Mr Francis Nona discussed issues topical  to regulators that affect the wellbeing of Aboriginal and  Torres Strait Islander Peoples. Increased participation Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander workforce  participation in the National Scheme and within Ahpra  has continued to grow. The total number of Aboriginal  or Torres Strait Islander Ahpra staff is now 23, eight more  than last year. Mr Olli Wynyard Gonfond was appointed  as National Director – Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander People and Culture Programs. Targeted recruitment campaigns resulted in the  appointment of 12 new Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander Board and committee members, bringing the  current total to 44.

National Boards 11 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24  ===== PAGE 12 ===== Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander Health Practitioners  Issues this year Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Practitioners  play an important role in ensuring their families and  communities receive culturally and clinically safe  healthcare. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  Health Practice Board of Australia continues to actively  engage with employers and other stakeholders to  support initiatives that ensure understanding of the  registration requirements for practitioners.  The Board and the National Association of Aboriginal and  Torres Strait Islander Health Workers and Practitioners  (NAATSIHWP) began working together on Strategic  Direction 1.1 of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander Health Workforce Strategic Framework and  Implementation Plan 2021–2031. This project is revising,  expanding and nationally standardising the professional  scope of practice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  Health Workers and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  Health Practitioners. Accreditation The Board participated in the review of accreditation  arrangements conducted along with other National  Boards, and agreed to assign the accreditation functions  for the profession to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander Health Practice Accreditation Committee for a  period of five years from 1 July 2024.  The Board acknowledges the excellent ongoing work of  the committee and the accreditation support team. The  committee continues to engage with its stakeholders,  including education providers, around a range of topics  relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health  Practice education and accreditation, and this is an  important pillar in the effective work of the committee.  Stakeholder engagement The Board and the Nursing and Midwifery Board of  Australia developed a fact sheet, Guidance for nurses  and midwives working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander Health Practitioners, to recognise the  collaborative role that nurses and midwives have with  our profession. A detailed program of presentations and  webinars was offered to support the dissemination of  this important piece of work. Strategic workshop The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health  Practice profession continues to grow, but in some  years at too slow a rate. To better understand  the issues facing the profession, in May the  Board brought together a group of its regulatory  colleagues and stakeholders to gain a shared  understanding of priority issues. The Board aims to  continue this significant piece of work by engaging  more broadly with industry and the profession in  the future. Other news In March, the Board thanked Ms Renee Owen and  Mr Bruce Brown for their unwavering commitment and  hard work as they retired from the Board. Renee retired  as our Chair and practitioner member after 12 years  of service; Bruce, a community member, retired after  nine years.  The Board welcomed two new members, Ms Jessica  Mitchell and Mr Steven Satour, to the Board, and I had  the opportunity and privilege of being appointed as  Chair of the Board.  As Board Chair, I offer my personal thanks and  appreciation to all Board and committee members,  whose efforts and contributions enable the Board to  continue its significant work.  On behalf of the Board, I thank Ahpra for the continued  support it provides to our work. And special thanks must  go to Mr Paul Fisher, Executive Officer; Mr John Brady,  Senior Policy and Project Officer; and Ms Bet Tennant,  Board Support Officer, for their amazing work and  incredible support throughout the year.

There were two opportunities for candidates to take  the exam this year.  By embedding this component into the regulatory  examination process, the Board is able to assess  whether each candidate has the knowledge, clinical  skills and professional attributes needed to safely  and competently practise as an acupuncturist or  Chinese herbal medicine practitioner in Australia.    Highlights this year Following the easing of travel restrictions due to  COVID-19 in various regions and countries, the Board  resumed communication with our international  counterparts. In January, the Board Chair met with  the regulator and educators in Hong Kong. In April,  representatives of the Board met with regulators,  educators and professional bodies of Chinese medicine  practitioners in Beijing, Shanghai and Singapore. These  international engagements offered a constructive  platform for knowledge exchange and learning with our  international counterparts. Our global partnerships are  vital for the exchange of knowledge and best practices.  Policy updates The Board published two revised guidelines,  Guidelines on safe Chinese herbal medicine practice  and Guidelines on infection prevention and control for  acupuncture and related practices, which came into  effect in December.  The Board undertook preliminary and public  consultations on the Guidelines on patient health  records, and will consider the valuable feedback  it received. The annual review and update of the  Nomenclature compendium was also completed. Stakeholder engagement In July, the Board visited education providers based  in Melbourne, at Torrens University Australia and RMIT.  It was an opportunity to see their centres and clinical  facilities and learn more about practitioners’ and  students’ clinical experiences. These visits completed  the Board’s undertaking to visit all education providers  of approved programs – a first since the Board’s  inception. The visits are integral to our ongoing  commitment to fostering strong relationships and  ensuring the highest education and training standards  in Chinese medicine to protect the public. In August, the Board held its annual Reference Group  meeting, welcoming representatives from Chinese  medicine professional associations, education  providers, individual practitioners, insurance  company representatives and community consumer  representatives. This was the first meeting of the  expanded Reference Group and it provided an  opportunity to foster communication and a common  understanding among participants.  In June, the Board met with representatives from  the national professional associations. Following  presentations on topics such as workforce and  advertising from Ahpra, there was positive discussion on  several profession-specific issues. The Board published a  communiqué following the meeting. The Board was pleased to continue its engagement  with the Chinese Medicine Council of New South Wales  and the Chinese Medicine Council of New Zealand. This  provided a great opportunity for the Board to share  experiences of regulation and to exchange views. Accreditation The Board considered reports from the Chinese  Medicine Accreditation Committee about Chinese  medicine education programs to decide whether  to approve the programs of study as providing a  qualification for registration in Australia. The Board  agreed to the assignment of accreditation functions to  the committee for the next five years. The Chairs of the  Board and committee met quarterly.  Other news In May, health ministers announced the appointment  of members to the Board. The Board was delighted  to welcome Mr Craig Bennett AM as a community  member and to learn of the Board members who were  reappointed. We farewelled outgoing members Mr  Roderick Martin and Mr David Brereton and thanked  them for their valuable contribution and commitment.

The Board held forums in each state and territory to  inform the revised Statement on paediatric care. These  forums were an opportunity to reinforce the need for  parents to fully understand their rights and the evidence  of treatment before it is provided to children. The Board  was delighted to be able to meet with practitioners  and thanks them for their willingness to contribute  professional insights during the sessions. Policy updates The Board published its Statement on paediatric care,  which provides strengthened guidance on best practice  and evidence-based care; proper informed consent;  practice within a chiropractor’s skills, competence  and expertise; advertising that is in accordance  with the National Law; communication; and good  practice when treating vulnerable communities.  In reviewing the statement, the Board ensured its  guidance was based on contemporary information,  and commissioned Cochrane Australia to update its  systematic review of the effectiveness and safety of  spinal manipulation in children under 12 years, which  was originally conducted for the Safer Care Victoria  review in 2019. In November, the Interim policy on spinal manipulation  for infants and young children was retired. It was  reinstated in June following a request from health  ministers and is pending further research. The Board continued its review of the Guidelines for  clinical record keeping for chiropractors. Stakeholder engagement The Board met regularly with its stakeholders  and regulatory partners, including professional  associations, the Chiropractic Council of New South  Wales and the Council on Chiropractic Education  Australasia. The Chair and Executive Officer met  regularly with the New Zealand Chiropractic Board  to exchange information and share experiences  about regulating the profession.  In October, the Chair, Executive Officer and a  Board member were delighted to attend the  World Federation Chiropractic Congress held  on the Gold Coast. They met with international  chiropractic leaders and regulators and  strengthened existing networks. The Board continued its program of presentations  to students, offering a great chance to engage with  the next generation of chiropractors and to help  them understand the expectations and requirements  for registration in Australia. Accreditation The Board completed a review of its accreditation  arrangements and has assigned accreditation functions  to the Council on Chiropractic Education Australasia  (CCEA) for the next five years.  The Board continued to work closely with the CCEA  and held quarterly meetings to exchange information. Other news In April, health ministers announced the appointment  of members to the Board. The Board was pleased to  welcome Dr Sam Millard (practitioner member) and  Ms Emma Slaytor (community member).  The Board farewelled Professor Anna Ryan and Dr Arcady  Turczynowicz (practitioner members) and thanked them  for their contribution and commitment to the regulation  of the chiropractic profession during their time on  the Board.

We focused on achieving these goals  by working collaboratively and consultatively with the  profession, our stakeholders and the public. Highlights this year Throughout the year, the Board met with stakeholders in  Brisbane and Adelaide, and engaged with co-regulators,  dental directors, education providers, professional  associations and the Board’s Dental Stakeholder  Liaison Group.  The Board trialled a new committee for matters that  have been identified as not needing a regulatory  response. The Low-Risk Early Determination Committee  pilot aims to reduce practitioner and notifier distress  by improving the efficiency and timeliness of the  notification process. Early indications from the pilot are  that matters are being finalised more quickly, which  should improve the practitioner and notifier experience.  The Board increased community representation on its  decision-making committees, approving revised terms  of reference in line with Ahpra’s Blueprint to improve  public safety in health regulation. These changes came  into effect from 1 July 2024. Biennial conference  The Board held its two-yearly conference on 8  September under the theme Safety, capacity,  capability – What’s next in dental practitioner  regulation?  The keynote was delivered by Associate Professor  Carmen Parter, who invited participants to take  a deep look beyond cultural safety to tackle  institutional and systemic racism.  Dental practitioner support  The Board continued to fund the Dental Practitioner  Support Service, a free, 24/7, confidential nationwide  telephone and online service for all dental practitioners  and students. Following a review of the service, the  current provider has been contracted to deliver the  service for another two years. Accreditation The Board again worked closely with its accreditation  authority, the Australian Dental Council (ADC), to  oversee accredited programs of study that, when  approved by the Board, lead to registration as a dental  practitioner. The Board agreed to reappoint the ADC as  the accreditation authority for the dental profession for  the next five years. Registration standards,  guidelines and codes The Board made progress on its review of its Specialist  registration standard, with a revised standard released  for preliminary consultation in May. Work continues  on a review of the Board’s registration standards  for conscious sedation and general registration for  overseas-qualified dental practitioners.  The Board participated in the multiprofession reviews  of the following standards: •	 continuing professional development  •	 recency of practice  •	 English language skills  •	 criminal history  •	 limited registration standards. The Board is also part of the multiprofession  development of guidelines for registered health  practitioners who perform and advertise non-surgical  cosmetic procedures.

To address the relevant recommendations flowing from the Kruk review (see page 8), we have designed a  program of reforms to help increase Australia’s appeal in a competitive global market for doctors.  This includes the development of an expedited pathway for registration of specialist international medical  graduates (SIMGs). Jurisdictions have set the priority specialties – anaesthesia, general practice, obstetrics and  gynaecology, and psychiatry. Ahpra and the Board set up a taskforce to work on the Kruk recommendations. This includes developing and  implementing the new expedited pathway to meet deadlines set by ministers. We consulted with specialist  colleges for the priority medical specialties to develop a list of qualifications that will be the gateway to  fast-track registration.  Once the pathway is established, international specialists with a qualification on this ‘expedited list’ will be  deemed qualified for specialist registration without assessment by medical specialist colleges.  The Board will grant conditional specialist registration to eligible specialist international medical graduates,  requiring them to complete a period of supervised practice to confirm their competence. These practitioners will  also be required to have training in the Australian health system and in cultural safety. Their registration conditions  will be removed when all these requirements have been met. The Board established a steering committee and a stakeholder advisory group to advise the Board on the  development of the expedited pathway. Both groups are supported by a dedicated new project team leading  our SIMG reforms. We developed and carried out a consultation on a new registration standard for specialist registration. This  is the regulatory tool we are using to improve the path to specialist registration in Australia while maintaining  high standards.  We also completed other significant policy, consultative and process work to meet the challenging 2024  implementation date for the priority specialties in the new pathway.  The Board is partnering with the Australian Medical Council (AMC), which will provide advice on the assessment  of qualifications for the expedited pathway, drawing on the expertise of specialist medical colleges. CPD homes From 2024, most medical practitioners were required  to have a continuing professional development  (CPD) home. The Board approved an additional three  accredited CPD homes, bringing the total to 20. All of  the 16 AMC-accredited specialist medical colleges are  accredited CPD homes and a further four non-college  CPD homes have been accredited. The Board has prioritised communication with medical  practitioners about the requirement to have a CPD  home. Other upgrades to CPD have flowed from the  revised registration standard introduced in 2023.  Headline changes include a requirement for doctors  to develop a professional development plan and to  complete the prescribed mix of educational activities,  review of performance and measurement of outcomes  in their individual CPD program. While this is a  significant change for medical practitioners who were  previously doing self-directed CPD, there should be  little change for specialists completing college CPD.  Medical Training Survey  More than 23,000 doctors took part in the 2023 Medical  Training Survey (MTS). This represents a 54.5% response  rate, which continues to build a robust data set that is  already being used to improve training.  Broadly, this year’s results were consistent with previous  years. Doctors in training reported that medical  training in Australia continues to be of high quality,  with demonstrable improvements in the quality of  supervision, orientation, education and training, and  patient safety training. Trainees reported that their  workload and hours of work have reduced, and fewer  trainees are considering leaving the profession. The culture of medicine continues to be a problem,  with 35% of trainees reporting that they have  experienced and/or witnessed bullying, harassment,  discrimination or racism. It is deeply concerning that  54% of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander trainees  experienced or witnessed these behaviours. The Board commissioned a new report of MTS data,  enabling an analysis of trainee experience based on  gender. Non-binary trainees reported the highest rates  of experiencing bullying, harassment, discrimination  or racism. Female trainees consistently reported  higher rates of experiencing bullying, harassment,  discrimination or racism than male trainees. We are delighted that we were able to publish static  reports of MTS results in December, within two  months of the survey closing. Early access to MTS data  provided doctors in training and health services with  timely access to results they can apply to support  positive change. National Boards 20 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24  ===== PAGE 21 ===== Cosmetic surgery The Board and Ahpra put in place a number of regulatory  reforms aimed at increasing safety and quality in the  cosmetic surgery industry.  The Guidelines for medical practitioners who perform  cosmetic surgery and procedures and the Guidelines  for registered medical practitioners who advertise  cosmetic surgery came into effect on 1 July 2023,  creating additional protections for patients.  Ahpra has been auditing practitioners for compliance  with the guidelines and the advertising provisions in  the National Law. Results show improvements over time  as practitioners and the wider industry changed their  practice to meet the higher standards. See page 80 for  more information on the outcome of advertising audits. Legislative changes restricting the use of the title  ‘surgeon’ to practitioners with specialist registration  in surgery, obstetrics and gynaecology, and  ophthalmology were passed this year. Consumers can  be confident that only surgically qualified practitioners  can call themselves ‘surgeon’.  The Board also established a national committee to  handle all matters related to cosmetic surgery, to  support consistent, robust decision making. See page 74   for information about cosmetic surgery notifications. The Board, along with other National Boards, consulted  on a number of guidelines about non-surgical  cosmetic practice. The independently chaired Cosmetic Surgery Oversight  Group confirmed that Ahpra and the Board have  completed implementation of the 16 recommendations  from the Independent review of the regulation of  medical practitioners who perform cosmetic surgery. Other issues of concern The Board’s telehealth guidelines came into effect on  1 September. They describe good medical practice  in telemedicine and acknowledge the important role  of telehealth in facilitating access to and delivery of  healthcare. The guidelines aim to support practitioners  to maintain safe standards of care. In February, the Board, together with Ahpra and other  National Boards, convened a forum addressing issues  related to medicinal cannabis. The forum aimed to  share information and regulatory intelligence, discuss  current risks to the public and optimise collaboration  between regulators. In June, the Medical Board, the Nursing and Midwifery  Board, the Pharmacy Board and Ahpra published a joint  statement on professional responsibilities for prescribing  and dispensing medication. We wanted to address rising  concerns that some health practitioners appeared to  be putting profit ahead of patient welfare by providing  customers with access to a predetermined medicine  with inadequate patient assessment and increased risks  of unsafe care. The Board faces ongoing challenges in the coming year,  as we design regulatory tools to ensure patient safety  protections keep pace with emerging models of care. Accreditation The Australian Medical Council (AMC) is the appointed  external accreditation authority for the medical  profession. It has a range of functions, including to  accredit medical schools and their programs of study,  specialist colleges and their programs of study, intern  training accreditation authorities and CPD homes.  After a program of study has been accredited by  the AMC, the Board decides whether to approve  the accredited programs as providing qualifications  for registration. In 2023/24, the Board approved the following: Medical school programs of study 6 Specialist medical college programs of study 5 CPD homes 3 Intern training accreditation authorities 2 Programs of study for endorsement for acupuncture 1 The Board assigned the accreditation function for the  medical profession to the AMC for a new period of five  years from 1 July 2024. Stakeholder engagement Newsletters and media The Board published 10 editions of the Medical  Board Update and two editions of a newsletter for  medical students. The Board responded to many media requests for  comment on a range of issues. We also received  requests for comment about individual practitioners,  and answered with limited information, guided by law. Meetings with stakeholders The Board has an active program of stakeholder  engagement that includes regular meetings with the: •	 Australian Medical Association (AMA) – annual  workshop held 5 December  •	 Australian Medical Council (AMC) •	 Medical Council of New South Wales •	 Medical Council of New Zealand •	 specialist colleges through the Council of  Presidents of Medical Colleges •	 professional indemnity providers •	 Drs4Drs – the Board provides more than $2m  funding annually for state-based health services  for all medical practitioners and students. Internal engagement The Board has a program of internal stakeholder  engagement to promote consistency in decision making  and respond to feedback from our decision makers,  including: •	 regular meetings with the chairs of state and  territory boards •	 the internal MBA annual conference for all  members of the Board and some Ahpra staff. National Boards 21 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24  ===== PAGE 22 ===== Medical school education packages The Board published a suite of education resources  on regulation and professionalism for medical students  in Australia. The purpose of the resources is to dispel myths and  misconceptions about regulation and to help medical  students understand the regulation of medical  practitioners in Australia. They provide an optional  resource for medical schools and align with their  ‘Professionalism and leadership’ curriculum.  The resources are published on the Board’s website.  A working group of the Medical Board and Ahpra staff  developed the packages.  We also trialled interactive workshops for final year  medical students that will be offered to all medical  schools. Consultations and registration  standards The registration standard Granting general registration  as a medical practitioner to Australian and New  Zealand medical graduates on completion of  postgraduate year one training was approved by health  ministers on 13 December and came into effect in 2024. The Board undertook public consultation on the draft  Specialist registration standard. The Board, together with other Boards, consulted  on the following: •	 Criminal history registration standard  •	 English language skills registration standard •	 Guidelines for registered health practitioners  who advertise non-surgical cosmetic procedures  (advertising guidelines) •	 Guidelines for nurses who perform non-surgical  cosmetic procedures (nursing practice guidelines) •	 Guidelines for registered health practitioners  who perform non-surgical cosmetic procedures  (shared practice guidelines). New fields and specialties The Board consulted on a joint application from the  Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine and  the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners  seeking recognition of rural generalist medicine as  a new field of specialty practice within the current  specialty of general practice.

We made significant progress in delivering benefit  for patients, the public and the medical radiation  practice workforce. Visibility and awareness Increasing visibility and awareness about regulation  and medical radiation practice is an important pillar  of our work plan.  We met with national and international stakeholders,  including the New Zealand Medical Radiation Practice  Board, the Canadian Association of Medical Radiation  Technologists, Medical Radiations Australia, the  Australian Society of Medical Imaging and Radiation  Therapy (ASMIRT), the Australian and New Zealand  Society of Nuclear Medicine (ANZSNM) and the  Australian Sonographers Association. We discussed  emerging issues in medical radiation practice, with a  focus on workforce availability, education pipelines  and capabilities necessary for professional practice.  The Board has developed a closer working relationship  with the Medical Radiation Practice Council of New  South Wales and looks forward to further collaboration  on joint projects and presentations. Our representatives attended a number of important  conferences: •	 the Indigenous Allied Health Association meeting  in November •	 the ANZSNM annual conference in Christchurch  in April  •	 the ASMIRT national conference in Darwin in May. Fee setting The Board continues to be attentive to setting  registration fees to recover the costs of the efficient and  effective delivery of regulatory functions in the context  of our Health Profession Agreement. Workforce safety and  sustainability We continued work on a number of practice issues  including radiation use, consent and anaphylaxis.  We engaged with a range of stakeholders in the  development phase of this work. We are committed to supporting the continued  development of a culturally safe workforce. With  the assistance of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  advisors, we developed specific resources for  practitioners and we look forward to doing more  work in this area in the third year of our work plan.

National Boards 24 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 Symposium 2023 generates  future-focused discussions We maintain a continuous watch on issues that  affect patient care, safety and the service capacity  of the workforce. A key feature of the work this  year was consideration of alternative models of  education, rural and remote education, and scope-  of-practice enablers. Many of these issues were  presented and discussed at Symposium 2023, an  event hosted by the Board on 27 October. More than  250 people joined us in Melbourne and online. The  program included international guests, Chief Allied  Health Officers, a range of health practitioners,  education providers and professional associations. The Board spent the day listening to the discussions  occurring not just on the stage but also at the  tables and during breaks. With the focus on issues  related to capacity, capability and collaboration,  there was much to discuss. A highlight of the day  was questions from the audience that prompted  lively and topical discussions about the future of  the medical radiation practice workforce. We have begun weaving the feedback into our  work and will start with the revision of professional  capabilities in 2024.  ===== PAGE 25 ===== Registration 19,851 medical radiation practitioners •	 Up 4.6% from 2022/23 •	 2.2% of all registered health practitioners 1,350 first-time registrants •	 956 domestic (including new graduates) •	 394 international 0.7% identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres  Strait Islander Figure 28.

Midwifery Futures is an in-depth review of Australia’s  midwifery workforce we are conducting in partnership  with the Macfarlane Burnet Institute for Medical Research  and Public Health (Burnet Institute) and colleagues. It  aims to set the foundation for the continued growth and  sustainability of the midwifery profession. On 14 March, as part of the project, we hosted the  National Midwifery Futures Symposium with our project  partners from the Burnet Institute. This event brought  together leaders, policy makers, regulators, clinicians  and consumers from across Australia. A final report outlining the current state of Australia’s  midwifery workforce and identifying opportunities  to strengthen and grow the profession will be  published in October. Our response to the Kruk review  The NMBA is scoping the next phase of work required  to support implementation of the recommendations  from the Kruk review – the Independent review of  Australia’s regulatory settings relating to overseas  health practitioners.  We are looking at how the NMBA can contribute to  easing workforce pressures through aiding the supply  of critically needed safe and competent internationally  qualified nurses and midwives (IQNMs). The work includes exploring evidence-based expedited  registration pathways beyond the Board-approved  comparable international regulatory jurisdictions, and  improving the outcomes-based assessment model to  ensure it is responsive to future demands. Designated RN prescribing  This year has seen significant progress of the NMBA’s  proposal to allow registered nurses (RNs) with an  endorsement to prescribe scheduled medicines.  The NMBA issued a Consultation regulation impact  statement that considered several options for  and impacts of a proposed model of designated  RN prescribing. The proposed model will enable RNs with an  endorsement for scheduled medicines to prescribe  within their level of competence and scope of practice,  in partnership with an authorised prescriber such as a  medical practitioner or a nurse practitioner. We recently submitted a Decision regulation impact  statement to the Office of Impact Analysis, which was  considered compliant. The endorsement and standard  were submitted to health ministers for approval.  Accreditation The NMBA assigned the Australian Nursing and Midwifery  Accreditation Council (ANMAC) responsibility for  accrediting education providers and programs of study  for nursing and midwifery for an additional two years. ANMAC and the NMBA work together to provide  efficient and relevant accreditation services for nursing  and midwifery, and engage on other projects to ensure  the provision of safe healthcare to all Australians. Policies, standards and  guidelines Non-surgical cosmetic procedures  The NMBA identified the need to raise the regulatory  status of the current Position statement: Nurses  and cosmetic medical procedures by consulting  on Guidelines for nurses who perform non-surgical  cosmetic procedures. These guidelines will apply to all enrolled nurses,  registered nurses and nurse practitioners who work  on non-surgical cosmetic procedures. Privately practising nurses  The NMBA consulted on the introduction of Guidelines  for privately practising nurses, developed to be more  responsive to the current healthcare environment. The  guidelines outline the regulatory requirements within  which privately practising nurses must practise. When implemented, the guidelines will give people  accessing the services of a privately practising nurse  confidence that they are practising in accordance  with their regulatory requirements and are committed  to continuously improving the safety and quality of  their practice. RN and EN standards for practice  The Board began a review of the Enrolled nurse  standards for practice and Registered nurse standards  for practice as part of our regulatory remit to ensure  they are nationally fit-for-purpose and evidence based. Our stakeholders expressed value in aligning the two  reviews to strengthen the project and create consistent  and connected enrolled nurse (EN) and RN standards for  practice based on best international regulatory practice. Nurse practitioner regulatory framework  In collaboration with ANMAC, the NMBA consulted on  our regulatory documents that form part of the nurse  practitioner regulatory framework. The public consultation sought feedback on the  NMBA’s Registration standard: Endorsement as a nurse  practitioner and Safety and quality guidelines for  nurse practitioners and on ANMAC’s Nurse practitioner  accreditation standards. Following a review of the feedback, amendments  were put forward that seek to ensure our regulatory  documents remain relevant and fit-for-purpose.  National Boards 26 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24  ===== PAGE 27 ===== Enabling the international  workforce IQNM assessment and registration  In 2020, Ahpra and the NMBA introduced a new  assessment and registration model to expedite suitably  qualified and experienced internationally qualified  nurses and midwives (IQNMs) into the workforce. As part of a quality improvement review, we evaluated  the assessment process, registration process and  orientation program designed to introduce IQNMs to a  range of concepts relating to Australian healthcare. Our aim is to make targeted enhancements to improve  the experience of IQNMs who go through assessment,  registration and orientation in Australia. Registration standard for IQRNs  The NMBA consulted on a draft registration standard  designed to streamline the registration process for  eligible internationally qualified registered nurses  (IQRNs) who have already been registered to practise  as a registered nurse in a Board-approved comparable  international regulatory jurisdiction. Streamlining the registration of IQRNs has the potential  to ease workforce pressures across Australia through  the supply of critically needed safe, competent and  effective practitioners. The registration standard would mean that IQRNs who  are usually required to complete the NMBA’s Stream B  outcomes-based assessment pathway would be eligible  to apply for general registration with the NMBA. Supporting nurses and  midwives Nurse and Midwife Support  The NMBA continued to work with Nurse and Midwife  Support to provide 24-hour access to confidential  advice and referral services for:  •	 nurses •	 midwives •	 students •	 managers •	 employers •	 educators  •	 concerned family and friends.  Online education modules  We contracted the Australian College of Nursing to  develop two standardised online education modules for  registered nurses, enrolled nurses and midwives who are  required to complete education following a notification  made about them. The modules are now live and available on the  college’s website. Fostering culturally safe relationships  In August, the NMBA and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander Health Practice Board of Australia developed  a fact sheet to guide nurses and midwives on the  collaborative practice role they have with Aboriginal  and Torres Strait Islander Health Practitioners. The new guidance gives nurses and midwives  information on working collaboratively with  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Practitioners  to provide culturally safe healthcare and to improve  health outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  Peoples.

National Boards 27 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24  ===== PAGE 28 ===== New IQNM exam location Ahpra and the NMBA partnered with the Royal  Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians  and Gynaecologists to use their Assessment,  Learning and Examination Centre in Melbourne for  the assessment of internationally qualified nurses  and midwives (IQNMs). Previously, overseas-trained nurses and midwives  who were assessed as holding relevant but  not equivalent qualifications had to travel to  South Australia to take the Objective Structured  Clinical Examinations (OSCE) before they could  be registered. The opening of this second site increased capacity  and shortened wait times to sit the examinations. This partnership meets the commitments made  by Ahpra and the National Boards to the National  Cabinet to develop options that streamline and  accelerate the recognition of health practitioners’  skills and qualifications to support a sustainable  health workforce for the future.  For more about this year’s OSCEs, see page 57.

Growing a safe workforce involves responding  to the current shortage and maldistribution of  registered occupational therapists, while ensuring  that the public continues to receive safe care. The Board is partnering with the Occupational  Therapy Council of Australia to create a streamlined  qualifications assessment pathway for practitioners  who have non-Australian qualifications that are  substantially equivalent or based on similar  competencies to Australian qualifications. The Board is also considering other ways to  streamline assessments of overseas qualifications  so that appropriately qualified occupational  therapists can more easily apply for registration  to work in Australia. Other work underway includes reviewing and  improving pathways for safe re-entry to registration  for occupational therapists who wish to return  to the profession after taking a substantial break  from practice. Accreditation The Board continued to approve the accreditation of  programs undergoing their scheduled reviews during  the year.  There are now 48 occupational therapy programs  of study delivered by 26 education providers  across Australia. Stakeholder engagement The Board met with a number of key stakeholders,  including: •	 Occupational Therapy Australia (the national  professional association) •	 Occupational Therapy Council of Australia •	 Occupational Therapy Board of New Zealand. These meetings provided the chance to discuss  emerging issues and to look for opportunities to  enhance collaboration on activities that are being  carried out across the respective organisations. In August, the Board hosted a breakfast event in Darwin  to meet with local practitioners to share important  information and discuss issues and concerns.  The engagement with local practitioners was valuable  in allowing the Board to remain abreast of emerging  issues for occupational therapists, and we have planned  similar events in Hobart and Adelaide to be held later in  the year. Other news In March, we said farewell to Ms Julie Brayshaw, who  was an inaugural member of the Board and served as  Chair from 2016.  We also farewelled Ms Roxane Marcelle-Shaw, a  community member who had been on the Board  since 2014.  Our sincere thanks to both Julie and Roxane for their  commitment and passion to regulating occupational  therapists and their contributions to the National  Scheme.  Also in March, I was pleased to accept appointment as  the new Chair of the Board. I joined the Board in 2021  as practitioner member for South Australia. I am deeply  committed to promoting the profession and enhancing  the quality and safety of health services.

Attendees included stakeholders in the optometry  profession and the meeting’s focus was on cultural  safety for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  Peoples. Representatives of the Board attended the  Indigenous Allied Health Australia National  Conference in November and the National Aboriginal  and Torres Strait Islander Eye Health Conference in  May, gaining further understanding of culturally safe  eye care, which will inform future policies. The Board welcomed the Chair of the Optometrists  and Dispensing Opticians Board of New Zealand to  its meeting in Melbourne in September.  This was a great opportunity to strengthen trans- Tasman relationships. Policy updates Along with the other National Boards and Ahpra, the  Board consulted on further changes to the Registration  standard: English language skills, Registration standard:  Recency of practice, Registration standard: Criminal  history and the limited registration standards. Accreditation In January, the Optometry Council of Australia and  New Zealand’s (OCANZ) revised standards for the  accreditation of Board-approved programs of study  in ocular therapeutics came into effect.  These standards include greater emphasis on the  integration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  cultural safety into ocular therapeutics programs. Along with Ahpra and the other National Boards,  the Board completed a scheduled review of National  Scheme accreditation arrangements.  The Board decided to continue its assignment of  accreditation functions to OCANZ for the next five years. Other news The Board welcomed the health ministers’ appointment  of Mr Terence Wong as the new practitioner member for  New South Wales in March.  In November, the Board was pleased to welcome new  community member appointees to its Registration  and Notifications Committee (RNC) and its Policy and  Education Committee (PEC).  It also welcomed a new practitioner member appointee  to its PEC.  Mr Stuart Aamodt was the Presiding Member of the  Board until March, a position that was in place until the  health ministers appointed a new Chair.

The Board also  completed preliminary consultation on introducing  limited registration standards. Board members served  on many other committees and reference groups in the  National Scheme to develop multiprofession initiatives. Accreditation The Chair and CEO of the Australian Osteopathic  Accreditation Council (AOAC) met with the Board online  every two months. The Board conducted a scheduled  review of accreditation arrangements. Stakeholder engagement Local  The Board held an evening forum at the Gold Coast  campus of Southern Cross University for osteopathy  registrants based in the area from Brisbane to northern  New South Wales.  The Chair participated in the quarterly Osteopathy Think  Tank organised by Osteopathy Australia (OA), which is  focused on education, workforce issues, research, data  and information sharing, and also participated in the  consultations and reviews within the National Scheme.  The Chair continued to attend Osteopathic Research  Alliance meetings, which comprise academic and  individual osteopathy researchers in Australia. Regular separate meetings were held with AOAC, the  Osteopathy Council of New South Wales and OA. These  meetings were mainly virtual. Three newsletters were sent to registered osteopaths  and students, and we published social media posts on  various issues and events such as World Osteopathic  Healthcare Week in April. A short social media post  celebrating 45 years of osteopathy regulation in Australia  was viewed 5,000 times. International The Chairs, Executive Officer and Registrars of the  Board, the Osteopathy Council of New Zealand and the  UK’s General Osteopathic Council met regularly during  the year, either virtually or in association with the 2023  Osteopathic International Alliance (OIA) conference in  London. The OIA conference is the annual meeting for  osteopathy regulators and associations from across  the world, and planning is underway for the next OIA  conference to be held in Sydney in October 2024. Other news The Board farewelled Dr Nikole Grbin and thanked her  for her tireless work as the practitioner member from  South Australia for 11 years, and for her leadership as  Chair of the Board since October 2014. The Board also farewelled Dr Pamela Dennis, practitioner  member from Tasmania, with 10 years of service on  the Board; Dr Andrew Yaksich from Western Australia,  with nine years Board experience; and Dr Julia Duffy,  community member from Queensland.

However, as the healthcare needs of the community  change, so does the role that paramedics can  play in primary and community care settings.  Paramedicine functions in an environment of rapid  change, and modern healthcare trends in Australia  and overseas continue to influence the skills and  capabilities of paramedics. This includes how  paramedics contribute beyond a first-response role  and whether there is a role for advanced practice  in paramedicine. As the national regulator, the Paramedicine Board  of Australia is keen to understand the challenges,  opportunities and regulatory infrastructure needed  to provide a flexible, responsive and sustainable  workforce. To explore these matters, the Board  invited senior state, territory and Commonwealth  representatives, private and public sector  employers, education providers, community groups  and regulatory bodies for a one-day national forum  to consider the future practice of the profession,  including advanced practice. The Board thanks everyone who attended and  contributed to the discussion. The Australian health ministers have agreed to  work with the Board to establish area-of-practice  endorsement for advanced practice paramedicine.  This includes reviewing applicable aspects  of critical care and community paramedicine  elements, along with full access to independent  prescribing rights outside the state ambulance  services. This is an important piece of work that  highlights the important role paramedics can play  in the health workforce. Accreditation The Board appreciates and acknowledges the important  work undertaken by the Paramedicine Accreditation  Committee in exercising the accreditation function for  the paramedicine profession.  The Board joined the other National Boards in reviewing  the accreditation arrangements for their professions and  agreed to continue to assign the accreditation functions  to the Paramedicine Accreditation Committee for the  period 1 December 2023 to 30 June 2029. Policy updates The Board participated in the ongoing cross-profession  reviews of registration standards including those related  to criminal history, English language skills, recency of  practice and continuing professional development.  It continued to routinely review and update other  published material to ensure it is up-to-date, clear  and accurate. Stakeholder engagement The Board implemented an enhanced communications  and engagement strategy for the profession.  Other news Health ministers communicated their decision on  appointments and reappointments to the Board. Ministers appointed Dr Simon Sawyer (practitioner  member Victoria) and Mr Sam Perillo (practitioner  member Australian Capital Territory) to the Board  to replace retiring practitioner members Associate  Professor Ian Patrick ASM and Mr Howard Wren ASM.  The knowledge, insight and experience that both Ian  and Howard have contributed to the Board over the  past seven years have been invaluable in transitioning  the profession into the regulatory scheme. All other members were reappointed for a further  term including my continuing role as Paramedicine  Board Chair.

We also announced the publication of the  Accreditation standards for pharmacist prescriber  education programs, funded by the Board. The  accreditation standards are available as a resource  for potential education providers to inform the  development of education programs on prescribing.  They are supported by a Performance Outcomes  Framework and evidence guide to support  education providers and accreditation decision  makers. The accreditation standards will also ensure  that graduates of an accredited education program  meet the competencies in the NPS MedicineWise  prescribing competencies framework (second  edition), which describes the practice expectations  of Australian prescribers regardless of profession.  We continued to work with government,  stakeholders and the public to explore the impact  of future developments in health service delivery  by pharmacists to support safe practice in the  public interest. Supporting professional  practice The Board released a joint statement with the Medical  Board of Australia and the Nursing and Midwifery Board  of Australia in response to concerns about emerging  models of care designed solely to provide customers  with access to a predetermined medicine including  compounded medicines.  The statement urged health practitioners to ensure that  the framework for their practice is consistent with their  professional obligations, and aimed to address concerns  that some practitioners may be putting profit ahead of  patient welfare. Review of registration  standards and guidelines Public consultation on the review of the Guidelines on  compounding of medicines was completed and the  Board analysed stakeholder feedback to inform revised  guidance. The guidelines will apply to pharmacists to  support safe compounding of medicines that meet the  unique needs of patients.  The Board also began a review of the following  guidelines in preparation for consultation: •	 Guidelines for dispensing of medicines •	 Guidelines on practice-specific issues •	 Guidelines on dose administration aids and  staged supply of dispensed medicines •	 Guidelines for proprietor pharmacists. To inform the review of its registration standard on the  supervised practice requirements for intern pharmacists  holding provisional registration, the Board held a  forum with stakeholders including pharmacy member  organisations, state and territory health departments,  pharmacy banner groups, schools of pharmacy, other  regulators, as well as students, interns, preceptors  and consumers.  Attendees shared their thoughts on the current  internship model and options for supervised practice  in the future. This feedback informed our drafting of  revised proposals for supervised practice of interns,  which we will test with stakeholders before we begin  public consultation on a revised registration standard.  The Board collaborated with other National Boards  in reviewing registration standards common to all  health professions.  Stakeholder engagement The Board continued its face-to-face engagement with  pharmacists and stakeholders by holding meetings  in Darwin and Perth. This enabled it to hear first-hand  about local issues affecting pharmacists and their  practice, and to discuss the Board’s role in protecting  the public.

The Board focused on a number of initiatives,  including the collaborative research with the Australian  Physiotherapy Association (APA) on physiotherapist  attrition rates. The aim of this research is to help  understand why physiotherapists are leaving the  profession.  Practitioners were surveyed and interviewed to  ascertain the reasons for changing careers or moving  away from clinical practice. The results of this research  will be published and used to inform the workforce  strategic plan into the future. In addition, the Board, in partnership with the Australian  Physiotherapy Council, has been reviewing the process  for assessing overseas practitioners to register for  practice in Australia and has facilitated more efficient  ways of supporting overseas-trained practitioners  to become registered in Australia. The Express FLYR  Pathway was launched in July 2023 to expedite the  Australian registration of practitioners from comparable  countries. Practice thresholds The Board, in conjunction with the Physiotherapy  Board of New Zealand, revised the bi-national practice  thresholds. The focus of the review was to update  the key competencies on providing culturally safe  care and digital competency, to reflect the increasing  reliance on technology to deliver services remotely. Strategic projects –  prescribing The Board, in partnership with the APA, is exploring  the public value of prescribing by physiotherapists.  The Board carried out several activities to  investigate the potential risks and benefits  of physiotherapy prescribing through  analysis, evidence gathering, dialogue and  engagement with stakeholders and practitioners.  The Board and the APA formed a national working  group, which is made up of physiotherapy  practitioners from various clinical settings and areas  of expertise, representatives from the APA and the  Board, and a number of prescribers and consumers.  The working group is focused on developing a  position on physiotherapy prescribing, assessing its  potential public value and determining the clinical  settings that would be suitable. Ahpra and the Board are drafting a paper for  consultation on the options for registered  physiotherapists to be involved in the prescribing of  medications. Stakeholder engagement  The Board continued to pursue its engagement with  key stakeholders, physiotherapy practitioners and the  community. It held Board meetings in Tasmania and  Rockhampton, where we met with local health services  and practitioners to understand the local health context.  The focus of these visits was to understand the unique  challenges of healthcare within rural and remote areas,  to hear about innovative approaches to care in the local  communities and to discuss any emerging issues.  The stakeholders included local practitioners,  representatives from public health services and  representatives from regional physiotherapy programs  of study.  The Board is committed to keeping abreast of issues  relevant to its regulatory mandate such as workforce  and protection of the public.

The review, which was  led by Professor Ron Paterson, included a thorough  examination of the Board’s regulatory framework  for podiatric surgeons, a public consultation and  interviews with stakeholders.  The final report was published in March. The Board  and Ahpra have accepted all 14 recommendations,  which relate to:  •	 registration and practice •	 education and training  •	 title •	 advertising  •	 handling of complaints •	 system safety and quality. The review found a good standard of care is  provided by podiatric surgeons, with only a small  number of practitioners generating the higher  rate of notifications. No evidence was found for  the need to reduce or regulate podiatric surgeons’  scope of practice. The review recommended  measures to improve some aspects of the  accreditation assessment of education programs  and to align ongoing continuing professional  development requirements more closely with  those of medical practitioners.  Concerns were also raised about the title  ‘podiatric surgeon’ in relation to clarity and  transparency for the consumer about the type  of practitioner they are seeing, and the type of  training the practitioner has completed. The review  recommended the Board seek health ministers’  approval to change the protected title for the  specialty from ‘podiatric surgeon’ to an alternative  title such as ‘surgical podiatrist’. The Board and Ahpra will progressively implement  the recommendations, which will involve wide- ranging consultation on these important reforms  to strengthen the safety of podiatric surgery. Policy updates The Board began a scheduled review of its  registration standard for endorsement of scheduled  medicines and guidelines for podiatrists working with  assistants in podiatry practice, which will involve wide- ranging consultation.  We consulted on new guidelines for registered health  practitioners who perform and who advertise non- surgical cosmetic procedures, and revised English  language skills and criminal history registration  standards together with other National Boards.  We also published a checklist to help practitioners  manage feedback and complaints. This checklist was  jointly developed by Ahpra, the National Boards and  the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in  Health Care. Accreditation The Board continued to assign the accreditation  functions for the podiatry profession to the Podiatry  Accreditation Committee for a period of five years  from 1 July 2024, following a scheduled review of the  accreditation arrangements with the other National  Boards. The Board considered reports from the committee  on monitoring of podiatry programs and on  accreditation decisions to decide whether to approve  the accredited program of study as providing a  qualification for registration. Stakeholder engagement The Board’s regular program of stakeholder engagement  included publishing three newsletters and holding  quarterly meetings with the Australian Podiatry  Association, Podiatry Council of New South Wales  and Podiatry Accreditation Committee. The Board also  met with the Podiatrists Board of New Zealand, the  Health Ombudsman Queensland, the National Health  Practitioner Ombudsman, and local stakeholders in  Adelaide and Melbourne.

We carefully reviewed the feedback from our public  consultation on an updated competency document.  A consultation report is available on the ‘past  consultations’ page of our website. We worked on finalising the Professional competencies  for psychologists and on developing various additional  resources and guidance documents to assist  psychologists in applying the updated competencies  in their scope of practice.  Once all documents have been approved, we  will publish an advance copy of the Professional  competencies for psychologists on our website at  least 12 months before they come into effect. Safety for Aboriginal and  Torres Strait Islander clients The Board has continued its commitment to the  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health and Cultural  Safety Strategy 2020–2025, with efforts to improve  safety for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander clients  and to support workforce participation of Aboriginal  and Torres Strait Islander psychologists.  Code of conduct  The Board publicly consulted on an updated code  of conduct. Our consultation proposed the following key  updates to the code: •	 Changes to language and structure:  including a more regulatory approach to  the expectations of professional conduct  and behaviour. •	 A greater emphasis on cultural safety:  specifically in relation to Aboriginal and  Torres Strait Islander Peoples, families and  communities. •	 Updated professional boundaries provisions:  such as removing the time-dependent  prohibition on sexual relationships with  former clients. We would like to thank the many individuals,  organisations and professional associations who  provided feedback on our public consultation paper.  Once we have reviewed and incorporated the  feedback, we will publish an advance copy of the  Code of conduct for psychologists on our website  at least 12 months before it comes into effect. Upcoming changes to the code of conduct and general  registration competencies are both major steps forward  in ensuring that psychologists deliver healthcare that  is free of racism, and in helping achieve equity in health  outcomes between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  Peoples and other Australians, to close the gap by 2031.  We would like to thank the many individuals and  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peak psychology  organisations who kindly agreed to partner with us in  this work.

Our regulatory work is not possible without the right  people serving on boards and committees. Ahpra  provided administrative support for 483 statutory  appointments made within the year (Table 3). Table 3. Statutory appointments Appointed  2023/24 National Boards 49 National Board committees and panels 288 State and territory boards 26 State and territory committees 120 Total 483 We have been working to increase the participation of  people from diverse backgrounds through advertising  and engagement strategies. There were 50.0% more  Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people, 66.7%  more people with disability and 164.3% more people  from rural and/or regional areas appointed to boards  and committees than last year, but 20.0% fewer  culturally and/or linguistically diverse appointees  (Table 4).

The program has four areas,  aligned to the three-year regulatory ‘life cycle’ of  members and boards: •	 orientation and induction of new members •	 professional development, including member  skills development •	 board effectiveness reviews •	 documentation for good governance practice. Regulatory decision makers from many professions also  received professional development to support them  in assessing matters involving sexual misconduct and  family violence. Orientation and induction During the year, 28 new board and committee members  attended our orientation program. It included an  introduction to the National Scheme and four self-paced  online learning modules on governance, decision making  and the National Law, information management and  cybersecurity, and workplace respect. Professional development Two professional development programs were launched: •	 An online regulatory governance learning module  covering 10 topics, available for members to  access on demand for a governance refresh or  to support them in navigating their board and  committee roles. •	 One-day face-to-face workshops on regulatory  governance and decision making, addressing  key governance concepts, competencies and  behavioural attributes using a scenario-based  approach. The workshops were delivered  by Board Matters, our external governance  services provider. During the year, 49 board and  committee members attended the quarterly  workshops, together with Ahpra staff who work  with the National Boards. Board effectiveness reviews Board effectiveness reviews are conducted annually  over a rolling three-year cycle: the Year 2 reviews are in- depth and formal, and Years 1 and 3 are ‘check-in’ years.  The 2023 review was in-depth, and involved a peer  assessment as well as the overall check-in that is  conducted as part of every review. Reports were  provided to individual board members and Chairs,  and a thematic report was prepared for Ahpra.  The review was completed in October.  The 2024 check-in review began in May. Governance documentation •	 We developed tailored content for an online  training module about workplace respect. •	 We reviewed and updated online learning  modules in preparation for the introduction  of a new learning and development platform. •	 We began a review of the Code of conduct  for board and committee members. Payments to Board Chairs Board members are entitled to remuneration (Table 5),  including travel and subsistence allowances, within  the framework determined by the Ministerial Council.  In addition to sitting fees for scheduled board and  committee meetings, Chairs may also be remunerated  for the additional work that is required. Table 5.

National Boards 46 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24  ===== PAGE 47 ===== 47 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 Accreditation Accreditation helps ensure that people seeking registration are suitably trained,  qualified and competent to practise as health practitioners. National Boards and accreditation authorities have separate but complementary functions. For example, an  accreditation authority accredits a program of study and the relevant National Board approves it as a basis for  registration. The accreditation authority for each profession can be an external council or a committee of the  National Board.  The Ahpra Board provides a whole-of-scheme perspective on accreditation governance, accountability and  transparency issues. This includes oversight of financial arrangements and performance reporting. Its Accreditation  Committee provides independent and expert advice on accreditation reform and other accreditation matters to the  National Boards, accreditation authorities and Ahpra.  Figure 85 (on page 48) outlines how the accreditation process works. The year in summary •	 182,647 registered students were enrolled in  approved programs. •	 More than 800 programs of study were  accredited and approved. •	 More than 130 education providers delivered  accredited and approved programs of study. Approved programs of study can be searched on  our website. Accreditation  Committee The committee met four times; Professor Andrew Wilson  AO is its independent Chair. Its priority areas of work are  supporting the future health workforce and strengthening  accreditation systems. The committee published its  Interprofessional collaborative practice statement  of intent in March. The statement represents a joint  commitment from 53 health and education organisations  to embed interprofessional collaborative practice across  the Australian health system, in education, training, clinical  governance, research and practice. The statement is a  fundamental step towards achieving effective team-based  and coordinated care across Australia. It is a commitment  to improving outcomes for patients and consumers by  reducing the risk of fragmented and uncoordinated care.  The committee published a glossary of accreditation  terms designed to support the interpretation and  implementation of its advice. It also carried out two  public consultations: •	 on draft principles to strengthen the involvement  of consumers in accreditation •	 on draft guidance on embedding good practice  in clinical placements, simulation-based learning  and virtual care to help improve initial student  health practitioner education.

Ahpra and all  National Boards completed the third scheduled review  of accreditation arrangements in 2023 and agreed on  arrangements for the next period to mid-2029.  The National Boards all made a decision on the  accreditation authority for their profession, and the  terms of reference and accreditation agreements for  the authorities contain a fresh set of key performance  indicators that will provide insight into both  accreditation authority and scheme-wide performance. Annual collaborative  meeting In May, Ahpra, the Health Professions Accreditation  Collaborative Forum and the Forum of National  Registration and Accreditation Scheme Chairs held  their first annual accreditation meeting to discuss  accreditation issues relevant to the National Scheme  strategy and scheme priorities. The meeting focused  on cultural safety and eliminating racism, artificial  intelligence, and changing workforce priorities, and was  attended by more than 100 accreditation stakeholders  from across the scheme.

One National Board – Nursing and Midwifery – exercises  accreditation functions related to education programs  through an external council, and exercises functions  related to assessment of internationally qualified nurses  and midwives (IQNM) through a committee established  by the Board. The National Boards contributed over $12 million  of funding to these accreditation authorities and  committees (see Table 6). Table 6.

The work of the  committees Ahpra supported the accreditation committees for  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Practice,  Chinese medicine, medical radiation practice,  paramedicine and podiatry to: •	 assess and accredit programs of study •	 monitor approved programs of study •	 develop and/or review accreditation standards  for paramedicine and podiatry •	 develop and implement consistent guidelines for  accreditation of education and training programs  in these five professions. We also supported the nursing and midwifery  accreditation committee to oversee the outcomes- based assessment of the knowledge, clinical skills and  professional attributes of internationally qualified nurses  and midwives who want to register in Australia. This work across six professions supports our  multiprofession approach to accreditation. Accrediting and monitoring  programs We supported the accreditation committees to assess,  accredit and monitor programs of study: •	 14 for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  Health Practice •	 6 for Chinese medicine •	 32 for medical radiation practice •	 24 for paramedicine •	 17 for podiatry and 2 for podiatric surgery. Policy and process We also supported the accreditation committees to: •	 continue to apply a flexible approach to  monitoring education providers’ compliance  with accreditation standards, based on specific  issues and risk profile – this flexible, risk-based  model enables responsive and proportionate  regulatory approaches to assessment and  monitoring activities •	 implement consistent cross-profession guidelines  for accreditation, complemented by profession- specific processes (such as establishing  assessment teams) •	 collaborate to implement consistent cross- profession processes and tools to collect  data from 43 education providers delivering  almost 100 approved programs across the  five professions •	 begin a joint review of their accreditation  standards.  Cultural safety in  accreditation ABSTARR Consulting completed the development  of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural  safety training specifically for accreditation  assessors within the National Scheme. The training  began in 2024.  There are six online modules that improve  assessors’ understanding of cultural safety  and their ability to apply cultural safety in  accreditation. Assessors will be able to use and  interpret the accreditation standards applying to  cultural safety to accredit and monitor programs  of study for the regulated health professions;  guide and compel education providers, and their  educators and supervisors, to provide culturally  safe training; and ultimately help students  and supervisors to contribute to culturally  safe patient care. Accreditation  ===== PAGE 50 ===== Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 50 Leadership and  collaboration to address  emerging risk As a risk-based regulator, we act on concerns raised  by colleagues, patients, employers and others.  Where concerns relate to specific individual health  practitioners, we have an established notifications  process to deal with them. To gain insights into changes  in the wider healthcare environment, we can analyse our  data, which helps us to recognise and respond to risks  early on.  However, recent trends in healthcare are moving quickly,  driven by change and innovation, and there is potential  for significant harm to occur that may not get reported.  We saw this in the rise of cosmetic surgery in the past  few years and, more recently,  in newer models of healthcare  marketed directly to consumers  such as the surge in prescriptions  for medicinal cannabis and for  semaglutide for weight loss.  Maintaining a balance between  access and the safety of emerging  models of care that may pose  significant risk is a key priority amid  a growing number of prescriptions  and the emergence of telehealth,  online prescribing and direct-to- consumer health services.  Many of these novel risks go beyond  individual health practitioners  and also involve the regulation of  places and products. To address  them, we join forces with other  regulators such as the Therapeutic  Goods Administration (TGA) to  take a system-wide approach to  patient safety. Collaboration with  other agencies is critical to keeping up with social  and technological changes. Coming together to share  knowledge, information and approaches results in the  best outcomes for the public. This year, we boosted our work with other regulators  and services on cross-regulatory issues – leading where  appropriate, supporting where needed, and taking a  stewardship role in uniting organisations.  In February, we hosted a forum on medicinal cannabis  that brought together health regulators to share  information and regulatory intelligence, with the aim  of balancing safety with access. Ahpra called this forum  together to examine how the responsible regulatory  agencies can work together in a rapidly growing field  to ensure clarity of roles and use our regulatory tools  to reduce harms to the public. We are part of an expert advisory group on medicinal  cannabis with the TGA, and have worked with the  TGA to organise discussions with state and territory  pharmacy authorities about specific medications and  the regulation of new models of  care. We also meet with the TGA  and Australian Competition and  Consumer Commission about  our respective work on shared  issues such as vaping and artificial  intelligence.  This cooperative approach is  echoed in other areas of our work.  In February, we hosted a series of  three symposia to explore ways to  minimise distress for practitioners  who receive a notification. We  invited support services, mental  health organisations, professional  associations, co-regulators and  others to collaborate on improving  the experience for practitioners.  Practitioners need support and  guidance to help them understand  their obligations under new  healthcare models, which also call  for a new approach to analysing  and determining risk. Ahpra is only one part of Australia’s  health system and we can’t solve these problems on  our own. By leading collaborative efforts to address  emerging issues, we are aiming to get ahead of them  before they lead to serious harm and ensure that, among  the rapid changes across the health sector, emerging  models of care continue to put patients first. We boosted our  work with other  regulators and  services on cross- regulatory issues  – leading where appropriate, supporting where  needed, and taking  a stewardship  role in uniting  organisations “ “ 50 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24  ===== PAGE 51 ===== 51 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 Registration Collaboration with stakeholders and continued streamlining of registration processes  has been a focus this year.   •	 In December, we changed the way overseas applicants verify their identity – they no longer need to present in  person in Australia before being registered. The change has reduced travel costs and application assessment  times, enabling practitioners to start work sooner. •	 In response to demand, a new nursing examination centre was opened for international applicants. All  candidates are now able to sit an exam within eight weeks of us receiving their examination request. •	 Overseas midwives can now take their first exam online, reducing cost and time as they no longer need to  travel to Australia or New Zealand.  •	 We held education sessions for employers and stakeholders who work with international medical graduates,  nurses and midwives to increase their understanding of the registration process. As a result, we saw more  complete and accurate registration applications being submitted.  •	 Subscriptions to the Practitioner Information Exchange (PIE) increased from 161 to 192. This secure web-based  service enables government departments, hospitals, healthcare businesses, pharmaceutical companies,  medical insurers and nursing and aged care agencies to do a bulk check of registration status and other  information published in the Register of practitioners.  The year in summary •	 The number of registered health practitioners grew by 4.9% to 920,535 (Figure 87). •	 96.9% of all registered practitioners hold some form of practising registration. •	 90,629 practitioners hold specialist registration in an approved specialty. •	 28,922 practitioners hold endorsement to extend their scope of practice in a particular area because  of an additional approved qualification.

This is a reduction on last year when there  were 3,805 withdrawals. (The usual reason for  withdrawal is the applicant not being able to  provide the evidence necessary to complete  their application.)  New graduate applications We received 41,476 applications from new graduates,  including 22,997 nursing applications. This is a decrease  of 2.6% and 4.5%, respectively, from last year, and a  second year of lower numbers following a big jump  (6.2% increase) in 2021/22. •	 30,185 of this year’s applications were received  between mid-September and March, the peak  registration period for new graduates.  •	 Timeframes to assign, assess, make first contact  and finalise when complete all improved on last  year, and contributed to the improved results in  our end-of-year graduate survey.

Register of practitioners You can check our online Register of practitioners  to see if someone is registered and if there are any  special requirements on their registration. The register was again the most popular part of  our website, with more than 8 million unique visits.  More than 11 million searches were made, of which  over half were for medical practitioners.  Following a redesign of our website, there was  a 36% increase in register use compared with  last year. Every page of the website now has a  prominent button to ‘Look up a practitioner’; in the  previous site design, most users navigated to the  home page to access the register. The website design improvements also resulted  in more searches of the Register of cancelled  practitioners: 121,427 searches were made and  there was a 94% increase in unique visits since  last year. Figure 90. Registered health practitioners by gender Registration  ===== PAGE 56 ===== 56 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 International applicants This year, 28,617 overseas-qualified practitioners gained  registration, a 48.4% increase from last year. •	 We registered 5,431 international medical  graduates, a 29.0% increase on last year. •	 We registered 351 internationally qualified  midwives and 16,622 internationally qualified  nurses, an increase of 28.6% and 48.6%,  respectively. •	 We registered 6,213 overseas-qualified  practitioners across the other health professions,  an increase of 71.8% from last year. We focused on improving the process and timeframes  for overseas applicants, including reducing the time to  finalise applications. It took 44.9% less time to finalise  ‘complete’ applications (those that included all the  necessary information): 33 days this year, down from  60 days last year. Mutual recognition with New Zealand  The Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Act 1997 (TTMR  Act) allows for many types of health practitioners  registered in either Australia or New Zealand to  apply for registration in the other country through a  streamlined registration process. The objective is to  remove regulatory barriers and drive workforce mobility  for health practitioners who hold current practising  registration in either jurisdiction. Registration in Australia will only be granted in the same  category as the practitioner’s New Zealand registration.  Any conditions, limitations or endorsements that apply  in New Zealand may also apply to the practitioner’s  registration in Australia.  There has been a significant increase in approved TTMR  applications: 14,452 this year and 9,129 last year, a 58.3%  increase (Table 10). The increase is most notable for  nurses and physiotherapists.  Changes to verification of identity We have changed the way overseas applicants prove  their identity, aligning it with the Attorney-General’s  Department’s National identity proofing guidelines.  The new requirements mean applicants no longer need  to present in person in Australia before being registered.  Instead, they can provide identity evidence while still  overseas, which can enable them to be registered  before coming to work in Australia.  This reduces the uncertainty for applicants and  employers and significantly decreases application  assessment times, thus enabling practitioners to start  work sooner. Once overseas practitioners are registered  and have moved to Australia, they must provide further  proof of identity.  Supporting employers Ahpra delivered eight virtual education sessions in every  state and territory to employers and stakeholders who  work with international applicants. This was to support  employers seeking overseas-qualified practitioners to  ease pressure on stretched local health services. The  objective of the sessions was to increase understanding  of registration processes for international medical  graduates (IMGs) and internationally qualified nurses  and midwives (IQNMs).  These sessions received very positive feedback from  employers and resulted in more complete and accurate  applications being submitted. This in turn reduced the  time taken to finalise applications and improved the  overall experience for applicants and employers. Table 10.

Registration  ===== PAGE 57 ===== 57 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 More nurse and midwife  exams In response to demand, a new examination centre  in Melbourne was opened for nurse and midwife  objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs),  and we can now run up to 20 exam weeks each  year across Adelaide and Melbourne. Each exam  week has capacity for 240 candidates.  At 30 June, all candidates had been offered an  exam date.  Some applicants sit an exam The number of international applicants sitting an exam  increased by 28.6% from last year.  Nursing and midwifery exams IQNMs are required to complete a self-check of their  qualifications before applying for registration. Those  who hold qualifications that are substantially equivalent  or based on similar competencies to an Australian  graduate (and who meet the mandatory registration  standards) progress to an application for registration.  Some IQNMs will need to pass an outcomes-based  assessment before being eligible to apply. The  examination process for these IQNMs consists of: •	 a multiple-choice question (MCQ ) examination  (knowledge test) •	 an objective structured clinical examination  (OSCE) (knowledge, skills and competence test). The MCQ examinations: •	 Enrolled nurse – a paper-based exam coordinated  by Ahpra and held at our offices around Australia.  Two exams were conducted this year. •	 Registered nurse – the National Council of State  Boards of Nursing’s online National Council  Licensure Examination – Registered Nurse  (NCLEX-RN) held at Pearson VUE testing centres  in more than 20 countries, including Australia.  This year, 9,859 exams (including re-sits) were  conducted, an increase from 8,077 last year. •	 Midwife – an online exam held at Aspeq-managed  facilities. There were 38 exams (including re-sits)  conducted this year in Australia and New Zealand.  Overseas midwives who are required to sit this  exam are now able to do so from their overseas  base. This reduces the candidate’s cost and time  significantly as they no longer need to travel  to Australia or New Zealand to take the exam  in person. The OSCEs: •	 2,333 internationally qualified registered nurses  participated in the registered nurse OSCE.  •	 The midwife OSCE was held twice during  the year, with 21 midwives (including re-sits)  participating in the exam.  Pharmacy, psychology, medical radiation practice  and Chinese medicine exams Ahpra coordinated the following exams: •	 2,331 pharmacy interns were assessed in the oral  examination (practice) in October, February and  June. All these exams used a hybrid online and  face-to-face model. •	 112 oral exams were held for pharmacy  practitioners holding limited or general  registration with conditions on their registration  that required the completion of an examination in  practice, or in law and ethics. These exams were  offered monthly. •	 2,270 candidates sat the quarterly national  psychology examination. Candidates could  choose to sit the exam in a test centre or online. •	 102 candidates sat the quarterly national medical  radiation practice examination. These exams were  also offered in a test centre or online. •	 19 candidates sat the scenario-based multiple- choice exam for Chinese medicine. Again,  candidates could choose to sit the exam in a test  centre (where available) or by online supervision.  •	 20 candidates sat the OSCE for Chinese medicine  over two examination periods. •	 12 candidates sat the paramedicine competency  assessment. “ “ Renewals of registration were 5% higher than last year Renewals Ahpra renewed registration for 840,816 health practitioners. This is an increase of 5.0% from last year. Each year when they renew, practitioners must confirm they continue to meet their National Board’s mandatory  registration standards. They must also let us know if there’s been any change to their criminal history or any health  impairment that may negatively affect their ability to practise safely.  Ahpra has continued to provide help to practitioners who were not able to renew their registration online. Only nine  practitioners took up this option. Registration  ===== PAGE 58 ===== 58 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  Peoples in the workforce Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples are  under-represented in our health workforce. Increasing  participation in the registered health workforce is a goal  of our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health and  Cultural Safety Strategy. For more about the work we  are doing to improve cultural safety, see page 9. Ahpra and the National Boards ask about Aboriginal  and/or Torres Strait Islander cultural identity in  application and renewal processes. This enables us  to understand workforce trends and the proportion  of registered health practitioners who identify  as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander. At 30 June: •	 Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander Peoples’  participation in the regulated health professions  was 1.2%. This rate has remained the same for  several years – the number of Aboriginal and/ or Torres Strait Islander practitioners is growing  steadily but is increasing at the same rate as  the total number of registrants. •	 The participation rate is well short of the  3.8% Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  representation in the general population. •	 100% of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  Health Practitioners are Aboriginal and/or  Torres Strait Islander. It is a requirement for  registration in that profession. Paramedicine  had the second-highest representation with  2.1% of its workforce identifying as Aboriginal  and/or Torres Strait Islander. •	 Midwifery (including dual-registered midwives  and nurses) had the third-highest representation  with 1.6%, followed by nursing (including dual- registered) with 1.5%. •	 During the end-of-year new-graduate registration  campaign, an additional 540 health practitioners  who identified as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait  Islander joined the workforce. Support for registrants The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Engagement  and Support team was established last year to better  support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander applicants,  registrants and stakeholders to engage with our  registration processes.  The team continued to support Aboriginal and/or  Torres Strait Islander graduates with their application  for registration (especially with any issues that arose  or disclosures they needed to make). The team also  supported practitioners who were renewing their  registration, providing guidance and support across a  range of issues and individual circumstances.  The team continues to use feedback from the new  graduate survey, from stakeholders, and directly from  the applicants and registrants they support to better  understand the barriers to getting registered and  renewed, and to improve the services we provide to  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander applicants and  registrants.

Registration  ===== PAGE 60 ===== Notifications Hearing from individuals or organisations with concerns about health practitioners  is an important way we identify safety and professionalism issues among registered  health professionals. Our role is to decide whether, because of a single  concern or a pattern of concerns, we need to restrict  a practitioner’s ability to practise. When we make these decisions, we are guided by  the National Boards’ codes of conduct, community  expectations and public safety. Explaining the data In this report, we mostly report on notifications  received and managed by Ahpra and the  National Boards. When we include data about matters received  and managed by the HPCA in New South Wales  and OHO in Queensland, they are either provided  in separate columns or, if incorporated into Ahpra  data, acknowledged in the table title.

Most  notifications (70.9%) are made by patients, their families  and friends, and other members of the public. This was  consistent with last year (71.0%).  A further 18.7% were from health practitioners  and employers. We received 2,620 confidential (we know the identity  of the notifier and were asked not to disclose it)  and anonymous (the notifier does not disclose any  identifying information to us) notifications. This was  44.9% more than we received last year.  Figure 93.

Visits were  89% higher than in the same period last year and  it has had more than 87,000 visits since launch.  •	 Improved engagement with notifiers through  a dedicated intake team to take all new  notifications. This team had more than 9,000  phone calls and more than 11,000 emails  with notifiers. •	 Established a team to support improved  consultation with the health complaints  organisations (HCOs) in each state and territory.  As a result, consultations between Ahpra and the  HCOs were completed an average of 7.6 days  sooner than last year.  •	 Worked with the Medical Board of Australia and  Dental Board of Australia to streamline decision  making for lower-risk concerns. This has resulted  in a 33-day reduction in the time taken to  complete lower-risk matters.  •	 Certificate IV Investigator Training for staff who  manage notifications to hone their investigative  and case-management skills. More than 200  notifications staff have completed this program  since January 2022.

An update of our support services  webpage (www.ahpra.gov.au/Notifications/ Support-services) has resulted in more visits. Experience We seek direct feedback from notifiers and practitioners  by sending them a survey when a notification is  completed. This year we saw an increase in notifier  and practitioner satisfaction with our processes.  •	 Practitioner responses reflected an increase in  overall satisfaction (from 57% last year to 62%  this year) •	 Notifier responses reflected an increase in overall  satisfaction (from 30% last year to 36% this year)  Specific to the process improvements we made in  relation to lower-risk concerns, practitioners are  reporting an increase in satisfaction (from 60% last  year to 64% this year).  For those practitioners where we adopted a  strengthening practice approach there was an increase  in practitioner satisfaction (from 57% last year to 60%  this year). The work we have done to support notifiers has also had  a positive impact. Notifiers whose matter resulted in no  restrictions on the practitioner’s registration reported  an increase in satisfaction with the process (from 25%  last year to 32% this year). Where regulatory action was  taken, notifiers also reported an increase in satisfaction  (from 59% last year to 64% this year). Though these rates are improving, we recognise they  are low and we continue to work on several fronts to  improve the experience of notifiers and practitioners.  Managing concerns  There are three types of allegations we can manage.  They are that: •	 a practitioner is practising their profession in an  unsafe way •	 a practitioner’s behaviour is placing the public  at risk •	 a practitioner’s ability to make safe judgements  about their patients might be impaired because  of their health. The most common type of concern relates to the way  a practitioner is practising their profession, including  concerns about inadequate or inappropriate treatment  (see Table 16). A notification can be about more than one concern  and 35.3% of notifications we received contained  multiple concerns. Not all concerns raised with us are about individuals  we register or things that we can deal with. When  concerns are not within our jurisdiction, we speak with  the notifier about why we are not able to consider their  concerns and, where appropriate, help them to seek  support elsewhere.

Either as a single concern or one of multiple concerns received in a notification. Our case-management approach Once we determine that a concern is within our  jurisdiction to manage, we decide how it can best  be managed by considering:  •	 the nature of the concern •	 the powers or processes best suited to  gathering the required information •	 the likelihood that regulatory action might  be needed. Where possible, each notification is allocated to  a single case manager from beginning to end. Early determination When a notification indicates no or low ongoing risk to  patients, we consider whether it is appropriate to refer  it to a health complaints organisation (HCO; also known  as a health complaints entity).  There are HCOs in every state and territory. They are  vital partners in ensuring that consumer complaints  about health services are resolved. HCOs share the  complaints they receive about registered health  practitioners with Ahpra, and Ahpra shares relevant  consumer complaints it receives with HCOs. Together  we decide which is the most appropriate body to deal  with the complaint. A total of 2,057 notifications were retained by, or  referred to, an HCO during the year. This is 18.4% of all  the notifications we completed and slightly fewer than  the previous year. A further 1,841 (16.5%) did not require referral to an  HCO but did not require any action from us. These  were closed.  Identifying at an early point which notifications can be  dealt with through early determination has significantly  improved the time it takes to close notifications.  We closed: •	 50% of low-risk notifications in less than 3 months  compared to 42% last year •	 88% of low-risk notifications in less than 6 months  compared to 67% last year.  Strengthening practice When a concern identifies some risk to the public,  we engage with practitioners.  Our specialist teams gather information from  practitioners, employers and others about a  practitioner’s practice and, where required, to  understand what steps have already been taken  to improve it. When this information indicates that we can rely on  individual, organisational or regulatory risk controls  to be confident there is no ongoing risk to the public,  we can take no further action (see Figure 95). Around half of notifications this year were referred to the  strengthening practice team and 19% of these matters  were closed without any regulatory action because the  practitioner demonstrated the steps they had taken to  reflect on and improve their practice.

Assessing and controlling levels of risk Lower risk: Risk controls at the individual level are identified and assessed  for their suitability in ensuring ongoing safe, professional practice Higher risk: Risk controls at the individual and organisational level are bolstered by  regulatory action, such as monitoring, to ensure safe, professional practice Medium risk: Risk controls at the individual level are strengthened through  organisational risk controls to ensure ongoing safe, professional practice Risk Referral to an HCO A notifier advised that their regular medical  practitioner had closed down their clinic. Signs  on the front desk and website advised patients  to contact the clinic to organise transfer of their  medical records to another clinic.  The notifier had sent two emails to the clinic  within a two-week period and had left at least  one voice message. The notifier had received  no response from the clinic and their medical  records had not been transferred to their new  general practitioner. Ahpra consulted with the relevant HCO, which  agreed they would help the patient to get their  medical records transferred to their new clinic.  Strengthening practice:  Steps taken to address The Psychology Board of Australia reviewed  patient records in the course of managing a  notification. It identified that the records of  consultations with a patient did not appear to  be adequate, contrary to parts of the code of  conduct that applies to psychologists.  The practitioner agreed with the Board’s  concerns and provided a copy of the  professional development and supervision  plan they had agreed with their employer  to improve their record keeping. The plan  included completion of an education module  on record keeping and regular auditing of the  practitioner’s records to confirm they were  compliant with the education. The Board decided that both the practitioner and  their employer had taken steps to address the  concerns. They decided to close the notification  without regulatory action being taken. No response required A patient raised concerns about a medical practitioner who  had refused to prescribe medication for their joint pain. The Medical Board of Australia decided that, as the  practitioner had practised for over 15 years with no prior  notifications, as it is best practice for medical practitioners  to exercise their own professional judgement in prescribing  medications, and that to refuse to prescribe is not  unreasonable, a response from the practitioner was not  needed. The Board decided no regulatory action was  required. Strengthening practice:  Regulatory action necessary Two notifications were received about a pharmacist.  The concerns raised included failure to:  •	 adequately store and monitor schedule 8 medications  •	 follow adequate protocols for destroying schedule  8 medications  •	 follow documented infection control procedures  while working in the pharmacy.  The practitioner had a history of notifications, which  resulted in the Pharmacy Board of Australia requiring them  to undertake further education in medication management. In their response to the most recent concerns the  practitioner advised they had introduced new policies  and procedures within the pharmacy. The Board noted the practitioner had taken some steps to  address the concerns but felt the steps were not adequate  to address the ongoing concerns about the failure to follow  established protocols.  The Board imposed conditions on the practitioner’s  registration requiring the practitioner to undergo  mentoring with a registered pharmacist and to be subject  to practice audits. Case studies Not a ground for a notification A patient raised concerns with us about having to wait 45 minutes to see her general practitioner. When she  asked about the delay, the reception staff advised her that the doctor was delayed due to a phone consultation.  The notifier cancelled her appointment and told the reception staff she would not return. She believed the doctor  should have better managed their time and not made her wait in the reception area.  We acknowledged the frustrations felt by the notifier but are not able to assist with concerns about waiting times  or the scheduling of appointments. We spoke with the notifier and provided her advice on seeking a resolution  directly with the medical clinic. Notifications  ===== PAGE 66 ===== Health management When a practitioner has a health impairment that affects  their ability to practise safely, we have a role to ensure  public safety. We have a specialist team that manages  health-related concerns and we continue to implement  changes to minimise distress for practitioners involved  in our regulatory processes (see page 81).  The improvements we are making have had a significant  impact on timeframes. During the year, 41% of health  concerns were completed within three months,  compared to 39% in 2022/23 and 28% in 2021/22.  Professional standards Behaviour by a practitioner that is substantially below  the standard expected by the public or their peers,  or inconsistent with the requirement to be a fit and  proper person to hold registration, is investigated by  the National Boards. They can refer the concerns relating  to the practitioner to tribunals across the country.  This year, 235 practitioners were referred to a tribunal.  This is a 1.7% increase compared with last year. Matters referred to tribunals include allegations of  sexual misconduct. Sexual misconduct notifications are  included in our data on boundary violations (Table 17),  which are 37.5% higher than last year. The numbers of  boundary violations reported to us have been growing  over recent years, and we have developed a plan of  work to manage concerns specific to sexual misconduct.  For more, see page 75. Under new legislative provisions that came into effect in  May 2023, the National Boards have limited discretion to  decide not to refer professional misconduct matters to  a tribunal. This year, Boards decided not to refer three  practitioners (eight notifications) as there was no public  interest in their notifications being heard by a tribunal.  Case study:  A health concern A nurse self-notified about their recent inpatient  admission following a new diagnosis of bipolar  disorder. This diagnosis, if unmanaged, could affect  the practitioner’s ability to practise safely. The nurse provided a letter from their employer  that demonstrated support for them to return to  work and a letter from a treating mental health  clinician outlining the steps the nurse had taken to  ensure a safe return to practice.  The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia noted  that the nurse had taken time off work, sought  treatment and was engaging with their employer  and treating practitioner to ensure they were  practising safely. The Board decided no further  regulatory action was required. Case study:  Serious conduct concerns Eight notifications were received across a  two-year period about a medical practitioner.  The concerns included:  •	 engaging in a personal relationship with  a patient and their children, including  making personal visits to their home,  providing financial assistance and, when  the patient ceased contact with the  practitioner, engaging in threatening  and intimidating behaviour  •	 threatening and intimidating other  health practitioners •	 disclosing personal information to another  patient in voicemails and texts, despite the  patient not responding to or engaging in  the correspondence •	 billing Medicare for services not provided  to patients and other inappropriate  billing practices.  The Medical Board of Australia decided to take  immediate action to suspend the practitioner’s  registration. Several months later, the practitioner  surrendered their registration.  After an investigation, the Board decided that the  concerns amounted to professional misconduct  and required referral to a tribunal. “ “ Improvements to how we  manage health concerns  are helping to decrease  timeframes – 41% of health  concerns were completed  within three months,  compared to 39% in 2022/23  and 28% in 2021/22 Notifications 66 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24  ===== PAGE 67 ===== 67 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 Table 17.

The OHO total for 2022/23 has been updated since the 2022/23 Ahpra annual report due to a change in reporting method. Immediate action When we are worried that there is a serious risk to public  safety, or it is otherwise in the public interest, we can  take immediate action while we make further enquiries. Table 19 shows that immediate action was taken 413  times (Ahpra data only). This is up 23.3% from last year,  largely due to the increase in notifications received.  Being the subject of an immediate action by a Board  can be extremely daunting. We only use our immediate  action powers when: •	 there is a serious risk to the public •	 we believe a practitioner’s registration has  been improperly obtained because they have  provided misleading information when applying  for registration •	 the practitioner holds registration outside  Australia and that registration has been  suspended or cancelled by another regulator •	 there is a clear and compelling reason to restrict  or suspend the practitioner’s registration based  on public interest reasons (including, for example,  that a practitioner has been charged with, or  convicted of, serious criminal behaviour). Notifications 68 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24  ===== PAGE 69 ===== 69 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 Students We look into concerns raised about students who are studying to become registered health practitioners.  There are limited grounds for making notifications about students: a notification can be made about their criminal  history, an impairment, or if they have not complied with a restriction on their registration. There is only one ground for a mandatory notification – an education provider needs to tell us when they have formed  a reasonable belief that a student has an impairment that may place a patient at substantial risk of harm when the  student is doing clinical training. •	 20 notifications were made to Ahpra about students; this is up from 16 last year. •	 Only one notification resulted in restrictions affecting a student’s registration, compared to four last year.

The majority of these notifications involve liaison with external agencies (including police, coroners and employers) as well as  multiple witnesses, which prolongs the investigation process. 2.	 Tribunal proceedings are conducted in accordance with timetables set by the responsible tribunal in each jurisdiction.  There were also 17 compliance breaches before tribunals at 30 June. Timeframes The changes we have made to how we manage concerns are helping us to close more notifications sooner. Nearly 80% of all closed notifications were closed within six months of receipt: 45.1% (5,029) within three months  of receipt, and a further 34.5% (3,849) three to six months from receipt. There was a significant improvement in  timeframes for closure: compared with last year, there were 22.7% more notifications closed within three months and  67.8% more notifications closed in three to six months. The number of notifications open for more than 12 months fell by 20.6% compared with last year, excluding those  being managed through a panel or tribunal process (see Table 20). Many of the higher-risk notifications referred to a tribunal or panel involve complex and long-running investigations.  They are often required to await the outcome of other legal or investigative processes such as police investigations or  coronial inquiries. Of the notifications completed this year, 195 spent time awaiting the outcome of an external process  and the average time waiting for the external processes was 344 days. Once a matter has been referred to a panel or tribunal, we rely in part on the timeliness of external parties, such as the  tribunal itself or the practitioner’s representatives. Once a matter was referred, it took on average 683 days for it to be  finalised by the tribunal.  “ “ There are limited grounds for making  notifications about students – we received  20 notifications about students Notifications  ===== PAGE 70 ===== Outcomes There are several possible outcomes for notifications (see Tables 21 and 22).

Joint consideration in Queensland The Office of the Health Ombudsman (OHO) receives notifications about registered and unregistered practitioners  in Queensland. Ahpra and OHO work together to manage Queensland notifications. Together we responded to 4,080 notifications,  and 42.6% were referred to Ahpra and the National Boards to manage (Table 24). OHO closed 1,509 notifications about registered health practitioners following joint consideration, after agreeing  with Ahpra that they did not require regulatory action. A further 833 notifications were retained by OHO for further  action (for example, investigation or other complaints-resolution processes). The average time to complete the joint consideration process was 7.5 days. This is consistent with the timeframes for  last year. For matters that were retained by OHO to close, notifiers and practitioners were advised of the outcome  significantly faster than before joint consideration was mandated in December 2021. The notification process for New South Wales, Queensland and the other states and territories is outlined in Figure 96. Table 24.

We also have a dedicated cosmetic  surgery hotline where members of the public and  practitioners can make confidential or anonymous  notifications. The hotline received 514 calls this year.  Ahpra received 199 notifications related to cosmetic  practice from all sources. At 30 June, we were  managing 299 cosmetic practice notifications  related to 102 practitioners. More than half of these  notifications (174) related to only 14 practitioners.  These 14 practitioners are no longer practising or  have restrictions on their registration while we  investigate. Three practitioners have been referred  to tribunals for alleged professional misconduct. Information flow between  regulators  Collaborating with other regulators improves everyone’s  information as we work together to reduce risks in the  healthcare system. The Cosmetic Surgery Enforcement  Unit meets regularly with relevant state and territory  health facility licensing units, such as the Victorian  Department of Health Private Hospitals Unit, and co- regulators, such as the Office of the Health Ombudsman  in Queensland.  Licensing units visit practices that offer cosmetic surgery  to confirm compliance, and during those visits, they may  identify concerns about individual health practitioners  that they can raise with Ahpra. Similarly, Ahpra’s  investigations into complaints about health practitioners  may identify concerns about licensed facilities, which  can be shared with licensing units. Meeting regularly  helps ensure that we are sharing information effectively.  “ “ We have a dedicated cosmetic surgery hotline where members  of the public and practitioners can make confidential or  anonymous notifications – the hotline received 514 calls Case studies: Cosmetic  surgery notifications  Regulatory action required  Following a site visit by a facilities licensing unit,  we were advised of concerns about a medical  practitioner. Medical records indicated that the  practitioner may have been performing surgery at  facilities that did not hold the appropriate licence  for the procedures. Patients had also indicated that  they were unhappy with their surgical outcomes.  Ahpra investigated the concerns and the Medical  Board of Australia decided to impose conditions  requiring the practitioner to undertake a period  of mentoring by another practitioner.  No regulatory action required  We received concerns about a medical practitioner  who had performed abdominoplasty surgery.  The concerns related to alleged poor infection  control practices when responding to a post- operative complication. Our investigation  included an interview with the notifier, review  of the patient records and additional information  from the practitioner.  Although the patient was unhappy with the  outcome, the investigation identified that the  practitioner had demonstrated adequate aseptic  technique and made adequate arrangements for  patient care. We shared the concerns regarding  infection control with the facilities licensing unit  so that they could assess any additional concerns  with the facility. Notifications 74 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24  ===== PAGE 75 ===== 75 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 Protecting patients from  sexual misconduct Any sexual exploitation of patients is a gross abuse of trust, and Ahpra and the National Boards condemn this  behaviour from health practitioners. Action plan to improve  public safety  Rates of boundary violations, which include sexual  misconduct, rose again this year (see page 67). In  response to significant public concern and media  reporting, in February 2023 Ahpra released an action  plan with reforms to better protect patients. Key work  this year included the following: •	 Supporting National Law reforms to include  practitioners’ past sexual misconduct on the  Register of practitioners to help people make  decisions about the practitioners they see,  and to increase nationwide consistency in  re-registration processes for practitioners who  had their registration cancelled. •	 Strengthening community voices in regulatory  decision making through including more  community members on committees that  consider sexual boundary notifications and  offering training for decision makers. •	 Continuing the review of the Criminal history  registration standard, to ensure the standard is  contemporary and meets public expectations  about who is considered safe to be registered  as a health practitioner. •	 Improving public information explaining the  regulatory action that has been taken for  a practitioner who has proven findings of  professional misconduct relating to sexual  boundary violations. •	 Ongoing work to improve how we identify and  manage sexual misconduct matters, informed  by a case review and research. Findings so far  are that our processes are working well, quickly  identifying serious sexual boundary matters to  allow immediate action. The review identified  areas where we can improve how we engage with  victim survivors or witnesses, particularly when  matters are on hold due to criminal proceedings. •	 Continuing to work with co-regulators and other  agencies to strengthen our engagement and  information sharing, including close work with  Ambulance Victoria, Victoria Police and the  Tasmanian Department of Health, and ongoing  work with the Queensland Police Service.  •	 Building on the success and expansion of the  Notifier Support Service to strengthen support  for people who report sexual misconduct. A  website hub is being developed for anyone who  wants to report sexual misconduct by a health  practitioner. Work also progressed on nationally  consistent legal submissions outlining how Ahpra  and co-regulators can advocate for notifiers and  witnesses reporting in tribunal matters. Supporting notifiers The Notifier Support Service is staffed by social  workers who provide emotional support to notifiers  and witnesses and help explain how our notifications  process works. It received 141 referrals and at 30 June  had 214 open referrals. An evaluation of the service has been running, which  combines program data and interviews with victim  survivors who have finished engaging with the  service. It is designed to understand their experiences  and the impacts of the service, and to inform  service development. In interviews, participants spoke highly of the service,  highlighting flexibility and quality communication from  social workers, and reinforced the need for beginning- to-end support during sexual boundary notifications.  The evaluation found that participants felt supported  in three main ways: •	 Social workers gave participants process  information, updates and an idea of what  was coming next. This helped them feel more  organised, focused and ‘on track’, and increased  their understanding of the complaints pathway  and their role within it. Reliable, proactive  communication from the service helped  participants feel that some of the mental burden  of engaging with a notification was reduced. •	 Social workers created a sense of safety and  connection for participants, which resulted in  positive feedback and warm reflections from  interviewees. Participants spoke of how social  workers met their emotional needs by remaining  calm and normalising their feelings, which helped  participants build rapport with the social workers.  Social workers ‘holding space’ for participants  – by giving time freely and listening actively –  gave notifiers and witnesses the opportunity  to feel heard.  •	 Connection with the service reassured  participants that they had a support person  who understood them and their needs and was  ‘backing’ them. The physical presence of the  social worker, such as at a tribunal hearing, gave  participants confidence. A broader feeling that  they were ‘not alone’ provided comfort to the  participants throughout a challenging process. These themes align with findings from other studies on  supporting victims through similar processes.  75 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24  ===== PAGE 76 ===== Compliance Placing restrictions on a practitioner’s registration allows them to start or continue  providing healthcare while keeping the public safe. We monitor any restrictions that are placed on a practitioner’s registration and we ensure that practitioners comply  with advertising requirements. The year in summary •	 4,470 cases involving 4,461 practitioners  were being actively monitored by Ahpra at  30 June. •	 When combined with the 1,130 cases being  monitored by the HPCA in New South Wales  and OHO in Queensland, this is less than 1%  of all registered health practitioners being  monitored nationally. There was a 6.1% decrease in cases being  monitored from 2022/23. We have closed 289  more cases than we opened in 2023/24.  Of the 4,470 cases at 30 June (see Tables 25  and 26): •	 2,863 cases (64.0%) were about suitability  or eligibility for registration •	 1,256 cases (28.1%) were about conduct,  health or performance 	– 428 for conduct 	– 424 for health 	– 404 for performance •	 351 cases (7.9%) related to prohibited  practitioners or students. Monitoring enables safe  practice We monitor five streams: •	 conduct •	 health •	 performance •	 prohibited practitioner/student •	 suitability/eligibility. When we receive a notification that raises serious  concerns about a practitioner’s conduct or performance,  Boards consider whether there are additional things that  a practitioner can do, or if there are checks and balances  that can be put in place so that they can practise safely.  Only a small number of notifications are so serious that  the practitioner is not permitted to practise.  Where a Board needs additional assurance, it may  impose restrictions on the practitioner’s registration.  For example, a practitioner who is the subject of an  allegation of sexual misconduct for conducting a  physical examination that is not clinically indicated or  that the patient has not consented to may be prohibited  from contact with patients of a particular assigned sex  or gender.  A practitioner with this restriction must not practise  until we determine that there are systems in place at  their practice location that will ensure their compliance.  The restrictions are published on the Register of  practitioners. The practitioner must report on all the  patients they have had contact with on a regular basis.  We then monitor the practitioner’s compliance by  Compliance 76 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24  ===== PAGE 77 ===== 77 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 checking that the: •	 practice location is suitable and has sufficient  systems in place to monitor compliance •	 practice staff and a senior person at each  practice location understand the requirements  of the restriction •	 practitioner’s information about the practice  location is accurate; for example, by visiting  practice locations •	 practitioner has not had prohibited contact  with patients of the assigned sex or gender. Where applicable, we also receive reports from  Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme  about patients seen by the practitioner. We recognise that having to comply with restrictions  can be confusing and stressful for practitioners. We  publish additional guidance to help practitioners  understand our processes. 1.	 Ahpra monitors compliance cases in the ‘suitability/eligibility’ stream in NSW. 2.	 Ahpra reports by monitoring cases established rather than by registrants being monitored. This is because a registrant may have  restrictions in more than one profession, division or stream. The 4,470 Ahpra monitoring cases relate to 4,461 registrants. The data  provided by the HPCA report the number of registrants being monitored. 3.	 In Queensland, Ahpra monitors all cases except where the restrictions are imposed by OHO as immediate registration actions.  OHO counts each of these actions separately, and not by practitioner being monitored. In a small number of circumstances,  one practitioner may be monitored in relation to more than one immediate registration action.

How monitoring works Compliance 78 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24  ===== PAGE 79 ===== 79 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 Conditions, undertakings  and restrictions  Where a Board imposes the requirements, we use  the term ‘conditions’.  In other cases, a practitioner is aware of what  they need to do and provides an enforceable  ‘undertaking’ that they will meet additional  requirements.  We use the term ‘restrictions’ to include both  conditions and undertakings. How we monitor We gather information to monitor health practitioners  and students with restrictions on their registration or  whose registration has been suspended or cancelled.  Monitoring plans guide our monitoring and compliance  activities, and help practitioners understand what is  required of them (see Figure 97). We have a National Restrictions Library (www.ahpra. gov.au/Registration/Monitoring-and-compliance/ National-Restrictions-Library) and we use the same  wording about restrictions for similar cases. This ensures  that the restrictions are achieving the desired outcome,  are understood by practitioners and that we develop  consistent monitoring plans.  Where a practitioner does not do what the restrictions  require, we first seek an explanation from them.  The Board that placed the restrictions may choose  to take additional action, such as issuing a caution  or imposing further restrictions, to ensure the public  remains protected. Prohibited practitioners We also monitor practitioners who are not permitted  to practise because they have had their registration  cancelled or suspended, have surrendered their  registration or are restricted from practising. •	 Tribunals have the power to cancel a  practitioner’s registration – these practitioners  can reapply for registration after an imposed  minimum period. •	 Tribunals and panels can suspend a practitioner’s  registration – these practitioners have their  registration reinstated at the completion of the  suspension period. •	 In cases of high risk, Boards are able to suspend  a practitioner through an immediate action  while awaiting completion of an investigation  or an assessment. •	 Boards can impose conditions or accept  undertakings that restrict the practitioner from  practising until a particular requirement is met. •	 Some practitioners who are subject to a  notification may surrender their registration or  request a non-practising form of registration. Most common restrictions Each restriction on a practitioner’s registration is  assigned a restriction category. A practitioner can have  multiple restriction categories – this results in a greater  total number of restrictions on practitioners than total  cases being monitored. The top 10 restriction categories by volume being  monitored by Ahpra at 30 June contained 5,579  restrictions (see Table 27). •	 69.9% (3,900) of restrictions in the top 10  restriction categories were imposed following  assessment of an application for registration or  renewal of registration. •	 30.1% (1,679) of the restrictions in the top 10  restriction categories were imposed because  of a finding made by a National Board, panel  or tribunal about a practitioner’s health,  performance or conduct.

Outcomes from monitoring  cases When a practitioner has completed the requirements,  the Board can decide that the restrictions are no longer  needed or the practitioner can apply to the Board to  remove the restrictions. The case is closed when the  Board removes the restrictions.  When we close the case, we retain important  information to ensure that we consider the practitioner’s  regulatory history for any subsequent applications for  registration and notifications we may receive. During the year, we created 2,302 new monitoring cases  and closed 2,591, leading to a decrease in overall cases.  Of the cases we closed: •	 1,584 cases were closed because the restrictions  were removed •	 907 were closed because the practitioner was no  longer registered •	 100 were closed for other reasons, such as  transferring monitoring for New South Wales  practitioners to the HPCA. Compliance  ===== PAGE 80 ===== Investigating advertising complaints We assessed 667 complaints about advertising. Of these: •	 140 were complaints about corporate entities or  unregistered persons, or assessed as serious-risk  complaints •	 446 were lower-risk complaints  about registered health  practitioners •	 81 cases had no breach  identified. We continued our targeted audit of  advertising about cosmetic surgery  and assessed the advertising for 72  practitioners and health services.  When we identify that advertising  by registered health practitioners is  not compliant with the Guidelines  for advertising a regulated health service, we first  provide practitioners with an opportunity to correct  their advertising and only take further regulatory action  when this is unsuccessful. Sometimes practitioners do not realise what they are  not allowed to claim when they advertise. We provide  information to help them.  Where practitioners fail to correct  their advertising, Boards may  impose a caution or conditions on  the practitioner’s registration.  National Boards took regulatory  action in response to 19 audits: •	 10 resulted in conditions  imposed on the practitioner’s  registration •	 9 resulted in a formal caution. Ahpra may also prosecute advertisers for breaching the  National Law (see page 85). “ “ We continued our  targeted audit of  advertising about  cosmetic surgery Compliance 80 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24  ===== PAGE 81 ===== 81 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 Balancing public safety  and practitioner wellbeing How do we minimise the  distress of regulatory  processes for practitioners? We plunged headfirst into a significant piece of work  to implement the 15 recommendations and 33 related  actions of the Expert Advisory Group (EAG). We have  achieved a lot, with more to be done. Highlights include  the following: •	 Introducing pilot training in mental health and  substance use disorders for staff and decision  makers. The aim is to raise awareness of the  risk of suicide and self-harm and improve  understanding of practitioner distress. •	 Reviewing the process for reporting serious  incidents where practitioners and notifiers  involved with us have attempted self-harm  or suicide, or have suicided. We have been  thoughtfully considering how to conduct reviews  of these incidents in a safe and respectful way  for everyone involved. •	 Developing communication principles to  improve our correspondence with practitioners  and notifiers. •	 Investigating the value and feasibility of a  navigation and support service to guide at-risk  practitioners through our regulatory processes. Because the work of the EAG found that practitioners  with a health impairment were particularly vulnerable,  we are proud of the measurable progress we have seen  in the way we manage health-related matters. There’s  been a significant reduction in:  •	 requests by the National Boards for independent  health assessments across notifications,  compliance and registration where a  practitioner’s treating practitioner is able to  provide the information – this change has made  the process less stressful and quicker, as well as  more cost-effective    •	 the use of immediate action in health matters •	 the time taken to determine health matters, with  more matters being closed after action taken by  the practitioner. Collaborating with partners We are excited about the emerging collaboration with  external partners to help minimise practitioner distress.  Some recommendations rely on the contribution of  external partners. In February, we held three day-long symposia. Support  services, mental health organisations, professional  associations, peak bodies for education providers,  indemnity providers, legal defence firms, the health  practitioner ombudsman and co-regulators, as well  as Ahpra and National Boards representatives, met  to collaborate on minimising practitioner distress.  The focus was on two actions: working with external  stakeholders to address myths and misinformation about  notifications, and encouraging practitioners to seek  support while involved in a regulatory process.  An extraordinary willingness to engage and collaborate  on change was evident at the symposia. Many novel  ideas were suggested over the three days and a variety  of activities are underway by external groups, Ahpra  and the National Boards. Here are just three examples: •	 The National Boards deciding to create education  modules on regulation and professionalism for  students (one for nurses and midwives and  another for all other professions), building on  those published in 2023 for medical students.  The aim is to build confidence among students  in understanding regulation rather than fearing it. •	 Developing short, engaging videos of doctors,  nurses and other health professionals talking  about their experiences of going through a  notification. These are on the Ahpra website  and published across social channels to address  the shame and stigma while encouraging  practitioners to seek support.  •	 A group of symposia attendees are collaborating  on user-friendly FAQs about the notifications  process, which will be distributed to a variety of  external stakeholders to ensure that accessible,  easily digested information is available. Dr Steve Robson in our video series about what it feels  like to receive a notification Brainstorming ideas at the symposia 81 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24  ===== PAGE 82 ===== Legal action Legal action by or against the National Boards or Ahpra is conducted by Ahpra’s  National Legal Practice. Tribunals The National Boards refer allegations of professional misconduct to tribunals in each state and territory. Only  a tribunal can cancel a practitioner’s registration, disqualify a person from applying for registration for a time,  prohibit a person from using a specified title or prohibit them from providing a specified health service. The data in this section report on the number of affected practitioners or tribunal matters. One tribunal matter can  include multiple notifications about that practitioner. There may have been multiple complaints about the same or  similar misconduct or multiple complaints relating to different concerns about the same practitioner that can all be  included in the one tribunal referral.  There were 392 practitioners with open referral matters in tribunals at 30 June, compared with 369 practitioners last  year. The National Boards referred slightly more practitioners to a tribunal, with 235 practitioners referred this year  compared to 231 last year.  The Legal Practice comprises: •	 Professional Misconduct Unit, which handles  tribunal referrals for alleged professional  misconduct •	 Panels, Appeals and Advice Unit, which handles  appeals against National Board decisions  and referrals to panels, and provides general  legal advice •	 Criminal Offences Unit, which investigates and  prosecutes allegations of criminal offences under  the National Law •	 National Information Release Unit, which handles  freedom of information requests and other  releases of information in accordance with  summonses, subpoenas etc •	 Corporate Legal, which handles all of Ahpra’s  governance and compliance responsibilities as  well as advising on all contracts Ahpra enters into •	 Legal Support Service, which provides paralegal  and other support to all legal units. The year in summary •	 Matters involving 187 practitioners  (relating to 313 notifications) were closed  at tribunal stage. •	 96.8% of tribunal matters resulted in  disciplinary action. •	 111 appeals were lodged about decisions  made by National Boards and 113 were  finalised. •	 There were 14 criminal prosecutions. •	 For the first time, a custodial sentence  was imposed under the National Law. •	 The National Legal Practice was named as a  finalist for In-House Team of the Year in the  prestigious Lawyers Weekly Australian Law  Awards. This is the second year in a row the  excellence of the practice was recognised. Legal action 82 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24  ===== PAGE 83 ===== 83 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 During the year, matters about 313 notifications  (involving 187 practitioners) were closed after referral  to a tribunal. Of these: •	 Matters about 305 notifications (involving 180  practitioners) were decided by a tribunal. •	 Matters about eight notifications were withdrawn  or did not proceed to a tribunal. 	– Three of these matters did not proceed  because the practitioner was deceased. 	– Five did not proceed because the Board  became aware of evidentiary issues  that were not apparent at the time they  decided to refer; and crucial witnesses  became either disengaged or unable to  give evidence in the tribunal proceedings. •	 96.8% resulted in disciplinary action. The National Boards continue to appropriately identify  the thresholds for referring a matter to a tribunal to  protect the public. Figure 98. Matters decided by tribunals  96.8% Disciplinary action  3.2% No further regulatory action, withdrawn or  did not proceed Tribunal decisions Matters included findings of professional misconduct  involving: •	 family violence offending and other serious  criminal offending including murder and serious  sexual offending •	 sexual boundary breaches and other general  boundary breaches, such as inappropriate  relationships with patients •	 sexual harassment of colleagues and patients •	 failing to obtain informed consent for intimate  examinations •	 failing to comply with public health directions  relating to COVID-19 •	 misappropriating medications, falsifying scripts  and inappropriate and/or improper prescribing  and dispensing •	 inappropriate commentary on social media  including commentary that was disparaging of  colleagues, denigrating certain groups in society  and contrary to best scientific evidence on  certain medical issues •	 inadequate clinical management and/or medical  mismanagement and/or providing treatment that  was not clinically justified or evidence based. Significant periods of disqualification were imposed in  some matters, including in matters involving: •	 the murder of two people (convictions) (40 years) •	 access to and possession of child exploitation  material (convictions) (10 years) •	 personal and sexual relationship with patient,  inappropriate billing in respect of that patient  (billing for consults when they were engaging  in intimate/sexual activity) and threatening  behaviour towards same patient (6 years) •	 inappropriate clinical treatment and/or  management of patients including inappropriate  prescribing and prescribing of schedule 8  medications without a permit (6 years from time  practitioner surrendered registration). We include links to published adverse tribunal  (disciplinary) decisions and court outcomes in the  Register of practitioners, unless the name of the  practitioner has been suppressed by the court  or tribunal. When a court or tribunal cancels a practitioner’s  registration or disqualifies them from applying for  registration, using a specified title or providing a  specified health service, this is recorded in the Register  of cancelled practitioners. When a tribunal reprimands, suspends or places  conditions on the registration of a practitioner, this is  recorded in the Register of practitioners. Published summaries We published 100 summaries about publicly available  court or tribunal decisions. Some decisions are not  published for privacy reasons or due to suppression  orders applied by the court or tribunal. Other decisions  may not be released by the court or tribunal until the  next reporting year. “ “ Only a tribunal can  cancel a practitioner’s  registration or disqualify  them from applying  for registration Panels Panels are established by the Boards and include members from the community and the relevant health profession.  Health panels must include a medical practitioner. Matters involving six practitioners (relating to eight notifications) were decided by panels, resulting in regulatory  action against five practitioners.

Criminal offences One way we ensure access to safe, professional  healthcare is to investigate and, where appropriate,  prosecute people alleged to have committed criminal  offences under the National Law. These offences include: •	 unlawful use of protected titles •	 unlawful claims that a person is a health  practitioner •	 performing a restricted act •	 unlawful advertising. Only registered practitioners can use protected titles  for their profession. It is also an offence to falsely claim  to be qualified to practise in a health profession or hold  yourself, or someone else, out as a registered health  practitioner. Penalties of up to three years’ imprisonment  and/or a $60,000 fine can be imposed on individuals  who commit these offences, and a fine of up to $120,000  for companies.  Figure 101.

All National Law offences, not only offences about advertising, title and practice protection. Criminal prosecutions Ahpra successfully prosecuted a number of people  found to have committed criminal offences (see Table  31), including: •	 ‘fake’ practitioners with no relevant formal  qualifications, who held themselves out  to patients and employers as registered  practitioners •	 practitioners who continued to practise after  their registration was suspended by tribunals  or a National Board •	 practitioners who continued to practise after  surrendering their registration •	 practitioners who continued to practise after  they failed to renew their registration, even  after they realised they were not registered. Significant prosecutions demonstrate the importance  of criminal offence provisions for the protection of  the public. Outcomes show that Ahpra continues to identify  appropriate thresholds for referring offence complaints  for prosecution. •	 14 proceedings were completed in the courts  for offences. 	– 13 prosecutions resulted in a finding of  guilt against the defendant. 	– In one case the defendant left Australia  before entering a plea and, while they are  not expected to return, a warrant for their  arrest has been issued by the court. •	 12 prosecutions were ongoing at 30 June. During the year: •	 547 criminal offence complaints were received, a 23.8% increase on the number of complaints received last  year (see Table 30). 	– 69.7% related to alleged unlawful use of title and unlawful claims to registration. •	 433 criminal offence complaints were considered and closed. •	 294 open criminal offence complaints were still under review at 30 June. •	 140 new complaints about advertising were considered – most related to the advertising of corporate entities  or unregistered persons, a 45.8% increase on the number of matters considered last year. •	 88 advertising complaints were closed.

Legal action  ===== PAGE 88 ===== 88 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 Improving health practice We collaborate across the National Scheme and with other organisations to make  sure that our standards, codes and guidelines are supported by strong evidence.  Research, consultation and collaboration help us respond to the rapidly evolving  nature of health practice, improve our services, and strengthen the trust and  confidence that the public, health practitioners and other stakeholders have in  the scheme. Collaboration and  consultation  Understanding people’s  experiences with us  We know that one of the most significant ways that  practitioners and members of the public engage with us  is through our notifications process, so we continue to  be interested in the notifier and practitioner experience.  Each year we interview people who have recently been  through our processes so we can understand what went  well and what could have been better. We also survey  people about those experiences.  We use the themes that come up in the interviews and  surveys for our quality improvement work and to help  our staff and the National Boards understand the things  that are important for a notifier or practitioner to have a  good experience.  We have just begun to survey people who are currently  going through our monitoring and compliance process  to understand what is working well for them and what  is not. We look forward to collecting this feedback and  using it to further improve.  The year in summary This year, we: •	 enacted amendments to the National Law,  including protection of the title ‘surgeon’ •	 improved website information for health  consumers about making a complaint •	 developed a checklist for practitioners  to help them manage feedback and  complaints directly •	 provided input into several government  policy consultations •	 continued, where appropriate, to share our  data and insights with key stakeholders. Improving health practice  ===== PAGE 89 ===== 89 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 89 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 Strengthening consumer  voices We are focusing on building stronger community  engagement and connecting with a broad range of  people, and the Community Advisory Council (CAC)  continued to be the primary source of consumer and  community representation. The CAC advises us on how  and where consumer and community voices are needed,  and how best to consult, especially with underserved  consumers and communities. CAC members actively participated in the National  Scheme Combined Meeting and were especially  interested in the discussion on how to include the  voices of patients and the community in regulation. This  was flagged in a frank panel session in which members  of the CAC and the community critiqued the current  representation of their perspectives within the scheme. The CAC provided feedback on Ahpra and National  Board strategies, standards, codes, guidelines, policies  and publications. For the first time, the CAC was part  of the panels for recruiting community members to  the National Boards. CAC members participated on  committees, reference groups and working groups, and  supported several National Board stakeholder events.  Members individually and collectively engaged with the  following issues and activities:  •	 desired attributes of community members  appointed to decision-making committees  •	 the consumer complaints reference group led by  the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality  in Health Care  •	 Ahpra’s relaunched webpage about how to raise  a concern and videos about the notifications  process  •	 review of the criminal history and English  language standards for registration  •	 the annual Medical Training Survey consultative  forum  •	 pathways for specialist international medical  graduates  •	 the Independent review of Australia’s regulatory  settings relating to overseas health practitioners •	 a range of reforms to keep patients safe.  The CAC met seven times and was chaired by Ms Patricia  Hall. Communiqués of its meetings are published on  our website. Consulting the professions The Professions Reference Group (PRG) met six times.  It was chaired by Ms Julianne Bryce from the Australian  Nursing and Midwifery Association. The PRG brings  together professional associations for each of the  regulated health professions. It provided feedback  on the development of our strategies to proactively  respond to emerging public safety concerns such as  prescribing via telehealth, our work to improve the  assessment and registration of internationally qualified  health practitioners, our reforms to improve the safety  of cosmetic surgery and procedures, and practical  implementation of amendments to the National Law. Ahpra updated PRG members on our work to identify  and minimise distress for practitioners involved in a  notifications process, the development of National Law  amendments, the Business Transformation Program,  graduate registration and practitioner renewal  campaigns, and our accreditation work. Patient safety partnership Our work with the Australian Commission on Safety and  Quality in Health Care (the Commission) to improve the  experience of making a health complaint resulted in the  production of several important resources for health  practitioners and consumers over the past 12 months:  •	 A checklist tool for practitioners managing  feedback and complaints, to support them to  resolve a complaint that is made directly to them.  •	 Changes to our webpage on how to raise a  concern (www.ahpra.gov.au/Notifications/ Concerned-about-a-health-practitioner)  to simplify information for consumers and  practitioners who are considering raising a  concern with Ahpra. Since this redesigned page  was launched in November, it has had an 89%  increase in unique views, a higher rate of user  interaction on the page (74% engagement rate)  and a 50% increase in traffic from Google. •	 Three short video animations for consumers,  which explain patients’ healthcare rights and  that it is okay to make a complaint, contain tips  for a consumer making a complaint directly to  their health provider, and explain how to make  a complaint to health complaints organisations  and Ahpra. In 2021, Ahpra and the Commission set up a reference  group to guide this joint work, which brought together  consumer and health profession perspectives. The  project focused on ensuring that the consumer  experience is better understood, and involved wide- ranging consultation, including with consumers with a  lived experience of making a health complaint and key  professional groups. Because Ahpra is only one of many  bodies responding to consumer health complaints, there  was ongoing engagement with other health complaints  bodies throughout the project.  A final report was published by Ahpra and the  Commission, which highlights the key findings from the  project and areas for continued work. For more, see  www.ahpra.gov.au/About-Ahpra/Our-engagement -activities/Joint-project. “ “ For the first time, the  Community Advisory  Council was part of the  panels for recruiting  community members to  the National Boards Improving health practice  ===== PAGE 90 ===== 90 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 Shared policy issues The National Boards and Ahpra regularly collaborate on  shared policy issues that affect the health professions  similarly. This supports effective interprofessional care,  helps to simplify regulation, and makes it easier for the  public, practitioners and employers to know what to  expect of registered health practitioners. Our areas of focus this year expanded to respond to the  changing healthcare landscape and evolving consumer  expectations of health practitioners and regulators.  They included: •	 developing resources to support professional  practice, such as information for practitioners  and the public about virtual care (telehealth),  which provided guidance to practitioners about  how to use virtual care safely and effectively and  guidance for the public on how to access safe  virtual care  •	 setting up new governance arrangements and  other systems to give us the ability to respond  rapidly to emerging issues, which can help us act  earlier to strengthen public protection  •	 supporting workforce capability by addressing  the recommendations of the Independent review  of Australia’s regulatory settings relating to  overseas health practitioners (Kruk review) •	 strengthening our focus on health consumers,  including consulting on a revised criminal history  registration standard. So that the National Boards’ regulatory requirements  remain contemporary and relevant, we developed  and reviewed a suite of other policies across multiple  professions, including: •	 draft guidelines for registered health practitioners  (except medical practitioners, nurses and  midwives) who perform non-surgical cosmetic  procedures, completing public consultation in  early 2024 •	 a joint review of the English language skills  registration standards for 14 professions,  completing public consultation on two further  possible changes to revised draft standards in  August and September and submitting revised  standards to health ministers which were  approved in June 2024. Policy consultations Throughout the year, the National Boards and Ahpra  together provided input to the following external policy  consultations and reviews: •	 Australian Bureau of Statistics comprehensive  review of the Australian and New Zealand  Standard Classification of Occupations (ANZSCO)  to reflect the contemporary labour market and  better meet stakeholders’ needs (Consultation  round 2) •	 Australian Commission on Safety and  Quality in Health Care consultation on draft  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  clinical care standard •	 Australian Government Department of  Employment and Workplace Relations draft  Best practice principles and standards for skilled  migration assessing authorities •	 Australian Government Department of Health and  Aged Care consultations on: 	– Intellectual disability health capability  framework 	– Unleashing the potential of our health  workforce - Scope of practice review  and issue papers 1 and 2 •	 Australian Government Department of Industry,  Science and Resources consultation on safe and  responsible artificial intelligence  •	 Australian Government Department of the Prime  Minister and Cabinet COVID-19 response inquiry •	 Australian Government Minister for Health on  family, domestic and sexual violence training in  the registered health practitioner workforce •	 Australian health ministers consultation on three  proposed reforms to the National Law: 	– Part 1: Expansion of the information  available on the Register of practitioners 	– Part 2: Introduction of nationally  consistent reinstatement orders 	– Part 3: Stronger protections for notifiers  and prospective notifiers •	 Jobs and Skills Australia 2024 Skills Priority List  stakeholder survey •	 Victorian Department of Families, Fairness  and Housing consultation on Social services  regulations 2023: Regulatory impact statement •	 Victorian Department of Health review of the  Health Services (Health Service Establishments)  Regulations 2013.  Improving health practice  ===== PAGE 91 ===== 91 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 Government relations Ahpra maintains a strong working relationship with  the Australian, state and territory health departments,  including through its Jurisdictional Advisory Committee,  which meets quarterly.  We continued to appear by invitation at Senate  budget estimates hearings. This is an opportunity to  provide senators with information about our work and  performance and address any queries and concerns. In April, the Department of Health and Ageing  announced the Independent review of complexity in  the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme.  We are engaging with the independent reviewer,  Ms Sue Dawson, and look forward to contributing to  this important review. National Law amendments Protection of the title ‘surgeon’ when used by medical  practitioners was an important element of new cosmetic  surgery reforms agreed by health ministers. This change  was enacted by the Health Practitioner Regulation  National Law (Surgeons) Amendment Act 2023 and  came into use on 20 September.  We also finished implementing the  final group of changes arising from  the Health Practitioner Regulation  National Law and Other Legislation  Amendment Act 2022. This last  group of 30 reforms started on  1 July 2024. On 14 May, Western Australia passed  the Health Practitioner Regulation  National Law Application Act 2024,  moving to an applied-laws model  and bringing WA into line with other  Australian states and territories. All of  the National Law amendments have  also begun in that state. Further changes are on the horizon,  with health ministers agreeing  in April to ensure that proven  allegations of sexual misconduct remain on a health  practitioner’s record in perpetuity. We are working with  governments as a legislative bill of amendments is being  drafted for introduction into the Queensland Parliament  by the end of 2024. Contributing internationally As a World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating  Centre for Health Workforce Regulation, Ahpra works  in partnership to strengthen the capacity and skills of  regulators in the Western Pacific Region of WHO. As  part of this work, we lead the Western Pacific Regional  Network of Health Workforce Regulators, with members  from approximately 20 countries. We held four regional  network webinars on important health workforce  regulation topics.  We also continued our partnership work with  other international regulatory bodies, including  the International Association of Medical Regulatory  Authorities and the Council of Licensure, Enforcement  and Regulation. Research and data Projects Our research, evaluation and data analytics work is  integral to examining, assessing and projecting trends  related to health workforce regulation and patient  safety. We established a regulatory intelligence function  to identify and address emerging regulatory challenges  and developed a four-year Research and Evaluation  Strategy for the National Scheme. We focused on  sharing our work with different groups, using a range of  approaches including webinars, conferences and peer- reviewed publications, and we developed a presentation  series around one of our evaluations. Our research and evaluation projects (with information  on Human Research Ethics Committee approvals)  included: •	 exploring factors associated with the retention  and attrition of nine health professions and  analysing workforce demographic snapshots  (Metro North Health, approved) •	 exploring factors associated with the retention  and attrition of physiotherapists in Australia  (Metro North Health,  approved) •	 identifying and improving  stakeholder access and  use of the Medical Training  Survey (Metro North Health,  approved) •	 exploring notifier and  practitioner experiences with  Ahpra regulatory processes  over time (Metro North  Health, approved) •	 exploring trends in  communication-related  notifications (ACT Health,  exempted)  •	 evaluating the Notifier  Support Service (see page 75) (Metro North  Health, approved) •	 evaluating the impact of the Health Management  Team (Metro North Health, approved) •	 evaluating the response to the pandemic sub- registers (Metro North Health, approved)  •	 evaluating Operation Reset (Metro North Health,  approved) •	 evaluating the retirement of Guidelines on  infection control (ACT Health, exempted) •	 conducting literature reviews on: 	– health practitioner communication and  patient outcomes and safety 	– the history of the Community Advisory  Council. “ “ Protection of the  title ‘surgeon’ when  used by medical  practitioners was an  important element  of new cosmetic  surgery reforms Improving health practice  ===== PAGE 92 ===== 92 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 Publications We wrote or contributed to three publications in peer- reviewed health journals: •	 Biggar S, Van der Gaag A, Maher P et al (2023)  ‘”Virtually daily grief” – understanding distress  in health practitioners involved in a regulatory  complaints process: a qualitative study in  Australia’, International Journal for Quality in  Health Care, doi.org/10.1093/intqhc/mzad076  •	 Mahat A, Dhillon IS, Benton DC et al (2023)  ‘Health practitioner regulation and national health  goals’, Bulletin of the World Health Organization,  doi.org/10.2471%2FBLT.21.287728 •	 Van der Gaag A, Jago R, Gallagher A et al (2023)  ‘Artificial intelligence in health professions  regulation: an exploratory qualitative study of  nurse regulators in three jurisdictions’, Journal of  Nursing Regulation, doi.org/10.1016/S2155 -8256(23)00087-X Access to data for research The comprehensive national data that Ahpra collects  have demographic, commercial and research value  and value for workforce planning. Our data access and  research policy and the information on our website set  out the data already available and how to access them,  and the processes for requesting data that are not  publicly available. We are not able to meet all requests  for information, as both the National Law and the  Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) impose strict limits on the use  of our data. A summary of the requests we received is shown in  Table 32.  We also provide a data-matching service to Australian  universities wishing to track graduate outcomes.  Ahpra can match a graduate’s student number to  their registration number so the university does not  have to manually search the Register of practitioners.  This enables universities to determine whether they  are meeting their funding requirements and the  intended outcomes of their rural training programs  by determining how many of their health students are  working in regional and rural locations. Some universities  also use the register to assess graduate outcomes more  broadly in metropolitan and rural areas. We received  and fulfilled seven requests for student data matching  in 2023/24. Each year Ahpra provides an extract of medical  practitioner data from the Register of practitioners to  Medical Deans, who combine it with their own data  from surveys of final-year medical students. Including  Ahpra’s data with their own allows Medical Deans to  display information about medical practitioners that is  broken down by a range of demographic factors, such  as gender, rurality, specialty, and graduates’ preferred  versus actual work locations.

About half of our website  traffic (51%) comes from search. Organisation  ===== PAGE 94 ===== 94 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 Transformation Program The Business Transformation Program is a structured  multiyear program of work that is putting in place a new  regulatory operating system to modernise our practices.  We continued to build and test the new system ahead  of our first release. This included work to support new  streamlined registration pathways for internationally  qualified health practitioners and to enable National  Law amendments such as displaying a practitioner’s  alternative name in the Register of practitioners.  We look forward to going live with the new system.  This will only happen when it is safe to do so. This means  that we will launch the new system when it is working  the way we need it to for staff, practitioners, applicants  and people raising a concern with us, and when we are  confident the register and all data exchange services are  working properly. Once we have the foundations in place, we’ll continue  to add more capability to make it easier and faster for  people to get registered, raise a concern with us, and  access and analyse our data. Leadership and people  Ahpra Board Ahpra’s governing body met 11 times. The board  publishes a communiqué of meetings that summarises  issues discussed and decisions made. It has four  committees, which each met quarterly: •	 The Accreditation Committee provides advice on  accreditation governance, reform, accountability  and transparency issues, and a whole-of-scheme  perspective on accreditation performance. •	 The Finance, Audit and Risk Management  Committee oversees risk and advises on the  effectiveness of the corporate assurance  framework, risk management, financial strategy,  sustainability and internal audits. It also oversees  the external audit process. •	 The Regulatory Performance Committee provides  advice, oversight and scrutiny of regulatory  performance measures and data. •	 The People and Remuneration Committee  provides governance oversight of strategy and  performance in relation to people, capability  and culture.

Though Ahpra is exempt from public  reporting requirements, we analysed pay disparities  so that we could address any gendered pay gap.  The results indicate that Ahpra has a gender pay gap  of 12.7% in favour of males. The average total annual  remuneration package for females is $17,000 less than  for their male colleagues. This pay gap is primarily being  driven by pay disparities in the Technology directorate,  along with roles at some senior levels, where packages  are slightly higher for males. Work that Ahpra will do to address the pay disparities  includes: •	 identifying opportunities to increase participation  rates of females in traditionally male-occupied  roles such as IT •	 improving workplace policies, such as  flexible working policies, to promote greater  opportunities to balance work and non-work  commitments •	 promoting opportunities for enhanced base- pay rates as part of the offer process for female  candidates for senior roles.

One application was withdrawn by the  applicant before an internal review was finalised. The National Health Practitioner Ombudsman and  Privacy Commissioner (NHPO) notified Ahpra that: •	 23 applications for external review of an Ahpra  FOI decision were made •	 3 external review applications were closed. The  NHPO provided notice that Ahpra’s FOI decision  had been affirmed in one matter, one matter  was discontinued by the NHPO, and one was  withdrawn by the applicant.  During the year, 345 FOI applications were finalised.  Outcomes are shown in Table 34. At 30 June, there were  60 open FOI matters. Evidentiary certificates Ahpra issued 123 evidentiary certificates, most in  response to requests from our co-regulatory partners,  health complaints organisations and police, to help  them perform their functions in the community.

Administrative complaints relate to concerns about the  service delivery, policies, procedures and decisions of  Ahpra, the National Boards and committees, and the  Ahpra Board. They are divided into three types:  •	 Stage 1 (straightforward) complaints are handled  by the Ahpra area that receives them.  •	 Stage 2 (complex) complaints are managed by a  National Complaints team.  •	 Stage 3 complaints are investigated or reviewed  externally by the National Health Practitioner  Ombudsman (NHPO).

There was a significant decrease in complaints about a  public campaign: 19 this year, down from 57 last year. A  public campaign complaint is made about our regulatory  role by individuals who are not a party to a regulatory  action and do not have a personal relationship with  the subject of a regulatory action. Often this involves  submitting a complaint after being made aware of a  particular regulatory matter, usually through traditional  or social media.  Issues raised  A complaint may include more than one issue. The 660  complaints we received were about 836 issues.  There was a significant decrease in dissatisfaction with  regulatory outcomes: 12.3% of the issues raised this year  were about dissatisfaction with a regulatory outcome;  last year this number was 26.2%.  Table 37 includes all issues raised. Table 38 shows more  detail about the issues raised for each profession. Table 37.

Issues about registration  In the 364 complaints received about registration,  processes and policies were raised 143 times,  communication was raised 89 times, perceived delay  in our management of applications was raised 77 times,  and dissatisfaction with a regulatory outcome was  raised 27 times.  Of the complaints received from practitioners about  how we managed their application for registration,  there was a reduction in concerns about communication  during the application process (mentioned 82 times,  down from 122 last year) and time taken to assess an  application (mentioned 68 times, down from 93 last  year). There is an ongoing trend of fewer complaints  about these issues following changes we made to  lessen the time we take to assess an application and to  improve how we communicate with applicants. Issues about notifications  In the 338 complaints about notifications, dissatisfaction  with the outcome was raised 195 times, making this  the dominant issue raised by people who had concerns  about our management of a notification. Communication  was raised 75 times, policies or processes 67 times, and  the time taken to finalise a notification 35 times.  For complaints received from practitioners about our  management of a notification made about them, there  was an increase in concerns about the notifications  process (mentioned 36 times compared to 25 times last  year). There was no significant change in complaints  about communication during the notifications process  and time to finalise a notification, mentioned 25 times  and 15 times, respectively.  Resolving complaints  We responded to 651 complaints. When we receive a  complaint, we look carefully at the information provided  and how people would like their complaint resolved.  We then conduct a review of the information we hold  and endeavour to respond in a way that meaningfully  addresses the concerns.  Table 39 outlines the actions we took to resolve  complaints this year. We may take more than one  action to address a complaint. Table 39.

We collaborate with the NHPO  to resolve complaints and we value its contribution.  Under our early resolution transfer process with  the NHPO, 99 complaints were handed to us to  resolve directly.  Organisation  ===== PAGE 99 ===== 99 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 We responded to 102 enquiries from the NHPO seeking  preliminary information about a complaint. We also  provided documents and other information in response  to 21 notices of investigation from the NHPO.  A complaint can be reported more than once if a person  complains to both Ahpra and the NHPO. Our performance  We aim to respond to complaints within 20 business  days.

Time taken to finalise complaints  Financial management Ahpra and the National Boards work in partnership to ensure the National Scheme operates efficiently, effectively and  economically. The financial statements section of the annual report describes the scheme’s position and performance  in more detail. Financial overview Key financial information for the past five years is summarised in Table 40. Income and expenses have increased in  each of these years in line with growth of and continuing investment in the scheme.  The comprehensive result fluctuates to meet the demand of increased regulatory activity and to make planned  investment in health workforce and public safety objectives. Accounting for other economic flows, the comprehensive  result of $7.4 million surplus for 2023/24 is an increase of $14 million from a deficit of $6.6 million in 2022/23. Table 40. Financial summary 2019/20 to 2023/24 Five-year financial summary 2023/24  (million) 2022/23  (million) 2021/22  (million) 2020/21  (million) 2019/20  (million) Revenue from government grants $0.6 $1.4 $2.6 $4.6 $1.7 Income from operating activities $306.1 $265.9 $243.1 $228.0 $214.7 Income from investing activities  $10.7 $7.4 $4.0 $2.6 $4.0 Total income from transactions $317.4 $274.7 $249.7 $235.2 $220.4 Total expenses from transactions $312.8 $285.0 $232.0 $217.8 $213.8 Other economic flows included in net result $2.8 $3.7 ($2.8) ($0.9) Comprehensive result for the year $7.4 ($6.6) $14.9 $17.3 $6.7 Net cash flow from operating activities $29.6 $10.8 $37.4 $37.7 $24.4 Collections on behalf of government agencies $48.5 $45.5 $41.1 $39.3 $37.1 Total assets $327.7 $307.6 $303.5 $284.8 $266.4 Total liabilities $225.2 $212.5 $201.8 $197.9 $196.9 Organisation  ===== PAGE 100 ===== 100 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 Financial performance An operating surplus of $7.4 million was achieved, well above the planned budget, as costs associated with the  sharp increase in applications and other regulatory activity were met from within the budget envelope with  efficient and effective response. The income of $317.4 million is an increase of $42.7 million from 2022/23. It is the result of health workforce growth  initiatives, which were partly funded by grants, and improved returns on financial assets. The fees for each National Board for 2023/24 were set to recover the full costs of regulation for each profession.  In some cases, these fees were indexed up to 5% in line with higher inflation, and two Boards were required to  raise fees by 15.7% and 7.8% to meet an increased share of regulation costs. For professions with very strong equity  balances, fees were not increased. Total expenses from transactions of $312.8 million is an increase of $27.8 million from 2022/23. Cost increases  arose from wage inflation and organisation growth, health workforce initiatives, and cybersecurity and  technology investments. Table 41.

Equity is vital to the financial sustainability of the  scheme. Its purposes include: •	 mitigating against unexpected loss not covered  by our comprehensive insurance •	 funding capital and strategic projects that  support the effective and efficient operation of  the scheme  •	 offsetting the impact to the financial position of  variance in the operating result. Equity held for each of the National Boards serves the  same important purposes, in relation to profession- specific risk and projects. Equity at 30 June 2024 is reported in Table 41. The  scheme is currently investing in a significant technology  program, external reviews and other strategic  investments to advance public safety outcomes. Assets Total assets of $327.7 million were held at 30 June, a net  increase of $20.1 million. Intangible technology assets  increased to $25.4 million, from $22.7 million in 2022/23,  and property lease assets were amortised, reducing to  $33.2 million as scheduled. An additional $4.7 million has been reported as  prepayments of the costs of configuration and  customisation of a cloud-based technology solution.  When the system goes live, the configuration and  customisation expenditure will start, and be amortised  over a period of up to five years. Liabilities The increase in liabilities to $225.2 million, from  $212.5 million in 2022/23, reflects higher registration  fees held in advance for all professions, higher contract  payables for supplies as timing of the Transformation  Program speeds up, and higher employee benefits. It is  offset by lower lease liability in line with lease terms. The year ahead In 2024/25, an operating deficit is planned, which  will draw upon equity reserves for investment in the  Transformation Program and respond to actions arising  from reviews of the health workforce and complexity of  the National Scheme. Regulatory activities are projected  to be self-funding, with break-even results anticipated in  line with the five-year financial plan. Organisation  ===== PAGE 101 ===== 101 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 Corporate risk, compliance and assurance Risk management Risk exposure is managed in accordance with the  Australian and New Zealand Standard (AS/NZS ISO  31000:2018). Ahpra’s Risk management framework aims  to provide sufficient, continuous and reliable assurance  on the management of major risks to continuously  improve regulatory services. During 2023/24, the  scheme managed its risks, both strategically and  operationally, within the following themes: •	 regulatory effectiveness and partnerships •	 business transformation outcomes •	 financial sustainability •	 actions to eliminate racism for Aboriginal and  Torres Strait Islander Peoples within healthcare •	 removal of barriers to access for identified  communities •	 public confidence and trust •	 engagement with technology •	 people and culture •	 health practitioner workforce sustainability. Insurable risk is managed through the ongoing  maintenance of Ahpra’s insurance portfolio, which  includes policies to adequately mitigate the risk of  financial losses arising from an (insured) event. Corporate assurance Ahpra operates an Integrated Assurance Model, whereby  assurance is provided through both the internal audit  and quality assurance functions. The internal audit  program provides independent, objective assurance  and advice regarding risk management to the Finance  Audit and Risk Management Committee and the  Ahpra Board. The quality assurance program provides  assurance to stakeholders of the efficacy of Ahpra’s  operational processes. Assurance activities help identify  and mitigate risks, and determine whether processes  assist Ahpra to achieve its objectives, produce required  outputs and outcomes, and identify good practices and  opportunities for improvement. Corporate compliance  management Ahpra’s approach to compliance management is based  on AS ISO 37301:2023 Compliance management systems  – Requirements with guidance for use. As part of this  approach, internal and external compliance obligations  are identified and assigned to various business units for  ongoing assessment and management, including the  response to legislative or regulatory change. Corporate legal compliance To ensure corporate compliance, we have: •	 implemented an Ahpra-wide privacy training  program  •	 participated in a rigorous procurement process  to establish an external legal firms register •	 reviewed the delegations of the Ahpra Board and  National Boards to ensure they are legally sound  and do not present risk •	 reviewed the legal compliance of various Ahpra  projects, including but not limited to funding  arrangements, data-sharing arrangements and  training programs •	 reviewed all contracts entered into by Ahpra to  ensure they are lawful and do not present risk. Modern slavery Ahpra is committed to upholding human rights and  eradicating modern slavery from its operations and  supply chain. Building on our second Modern slavery  statement, we have put robust measures in place,  including comprehensive risk assessments, due  diligence, supplier audits and employee training. Our  strengthened procurement and contract management  policies further demonstrate our ongoing efforts to  prevent and mitigate modern slavery risks. Organisation  ===== PAGE 102 ===== 102 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 Financial statements  for the year ended  30 June 2024 Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency Declaration by Chair of the Board, Chief Executive Officer  and Executive Director, Finance and Risk The attached financial statements for the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra) have been  prepared in accordance with Part 3 of Schedule 3 to the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Act 2009 (the  National Law), as in force in each state and territory, Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations, and other  mandatory professional reporting requirements. We further state that, in our opinion, the information set out in the Statement of comprehensive income, Statement  of financial position, Statement of changes in equity, Statement of cash flow, and accompanying notes, presents  fairly the financial transactions during the year ended 30 June 2024 and financial position of the Australian Health  Practitioner Regulation Agency as at 30 June 2024. At the time of signing, we are not aware of any circumstance that would render any particulars included in the  financial statements to be misleading or inaccurate.

In my opinion the financial report presents fairly, in all material respects, the financial  position of the agency as at 30 June 2024 and its financial performance and cash flows for  the year then ended in accordance with the financial reporting requirements of Part 3 of  Schedule 3 of the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Act 2009 and applicable  Australian Accounting Standards.    Basis for  Opinion  I have conducted my audit in accordance with the Audit Act 1994 which incorporates the  Australian Auditing Standards. I further describe my responsibilities under that Act and  those standards in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report section  of my report.   My independence is established by the Constitution Act 1975. My staff and I are  independent of the agency in accordance with the ethical requirements of the Accounting  Professional and Ethical Standards Board’s APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional  Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) that are relevant to my audit of  the financial report in Victoria. My staff and I have also fulfilled our other ethical  responsibilities in accordance with the Code.  I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a  basis for my opinion.  Board's  responsibilities  for the  financial  report  The Board of the agency is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the  financial report in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Health  Practitioner Regulation National Law Act 2009, and for such internal control as the Board  determines is necessary to enable the preparation and fair presentation of a financial report  that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  In preparing the financial report, the Board is responsible for assessing the agency’s ability  to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern  and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is inappropriate to do so.  Financial statements  ===== PAGE 104 ===== 104 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24   2  OFFICIAL  OFFICIAL  Auditor’s  responsibilities  for the audit  of the financial  report  As required by the Audit Act 1994, my responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial  report based on the audit. My objectives for the audit are to obtain reasonable assurance  about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether  due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable  assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in  accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material  misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are  considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected  to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.   As part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, I exercise  professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also:   •  identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether  due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks,  and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my  opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is  higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,  intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.  •  obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design  audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose  of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the agency’s internal control  •  evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of  accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board  •  conclude on the appropriateness of the Board’s use of the going concern basis of  accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material  uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on  the agency’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material  uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the  related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to  modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to  the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the  agency to cease to continue as a going concern.   •  evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report,  including the disclosures, and whether the financial report represents the underlying  transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.   I communicate with the Board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and  timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in  internal control that I identify during my audit.

Financial statements  ===== PAGE 107 ===== 107 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 About this report Reporting entity The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency  (Ahpra) is a statutory body governed by the Health  Practitioner Regulation National Law (the National Law),  which came into effect in most states and territories on  1 July 2010 and in Western Australia on 18 October 2010.  This law means that registered health professions are  regulated by nationally consistent legislation. Ahpra supports the National Boards in the administration  of the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme  (the National Scheme) across Australia. National Boards  are responsible for regulating their respective health  professions. The primary role of the National Boards is to  protect the public and set standards and policies that all  registered health practitioners must meet.  The Ahpra Board oversees the work of Ahpra. The Chair  of the Ahpra Board is Ms Gill Callister PSM. The Chief  Executive Officer is Mr Martin Fletcher. The financial statements include activities of Ahpra and  National Boards.  Ahpra’s corporate address is 111 Bourke Street,  Melbourne, Victoria, 3000. Basis of accounting preparation and  measurement The financial statements have been prepared on a  going-concern basis.  These financial statements are in Australian dollars and  the historical cost convention is used unless a different  measurement basis is specifically disclosed in the note  associated with the item measured on a different basis.  The accrual basis of accounting has been applied in  preparing these financial statements, except for the  cash flow information, whereby assets, liabilities, equity,  income or expenses are recognised in the reporting  period to which they relate, regardless of when  cash is received or paid. Judgements, estimates and assumptions are required to  be made about financial information being presented.  The significant judgements made in the preparation  of these financial statements are disclosed in the  notes where amounts affected by those judgements  are disclosed. Estimates and associated assumptions  are based on professional judgements derived from  historical experience and various other factors that are  believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Actual results may differ from these estimates. The  estimates and underlying assumptions used in preparing  these financial statements are reviewed on an ongoing  basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised  in the period in which the estimate is revised and  in future periods that are affected by the revision.  Judgements and assumptions made by management in  the application of Australian Accounting Standards (AAS)  that have significant effects on the financial statements  and estimates have been disclosed under each relevant  note of the financial statements. All amounts in the financial statements have been  rounded to the nearest thousand dollars unless  otherwise stated. Regulatory fees do not constitute a supply and are  therefore exempt from GST. Revenue, expenses and  assets are recognised net of GST except where the  amount of GST incurred is not recoverable, in which  case it is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition  of an asset or part of an item of expense or revenue.  GST receivable from or payable to the Australian  Taxation Office (ATO) is included in the Statement of  financial position. The GST component of a receipt or  payment is recognised on a gross basis in the Statement  of cash flows in accordance with AASB 107 Statement  of Cash Flows. Income tax effect accounting has not been applied as  Ahpra is exempt from income tax under section 50–25  of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Statement of compliance These financial statements are referred to as general  purpose financial statements which have been prepared  in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and  Interpretations and other mandatory requirements.  The financial statements have also been prepared  in accordance with the relevant requirements of the  National Law, as in force in each state and territory. For the purpose of preparing the financial statements,  Ahpra is a not-for-profit entity.  Accounting policies selected and applied in preparing  the financial statements for the year ended 30 June  2024 ensure that the resulting financial information  satisfies the concepts of relevance and reliability,  thereby ensuring that the substance of the underlying  transactions or other events is appropriately reported.  These financial statements were authorised to be issued  by the Ahpra Board on 22 August 2024. Note A: Funding delivery of  our services A1. Registration and application fees A2. Investment income A3. Grant revenue A4. Other income and revenue Introduction Ahpra supports the National Boards in the administration  of the National Scheme across Australia. National Boards  are responsible for regulating their respective health  professions. The primary role of the National Boards is to  protect the public and set standards and policies that all  registered health practitioners must meet.  Ahpra is predominantly funded by regulatory fees to  deliver services in partnership with the National Boards. Judgement required Ahpra has made the judgement assessing whether there  is an enforceable contract with specific performance  obligations to recognise revenue or income. Revenue and income are recognised to the extent that it  is probable that the economic benefits will flow to Ahpra  and it can be reliably measured. Revenue and income  over which Ahpra does not have control is disclosed as  administered revenue and income (see Note G7). Financial statements  ===== PAGE 108 ===== 108 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 Note A1: Registration and application fees Ahpra collects registration fees and in return provides eligible registrants rights to practise and provide suitable  healthcare to the public. Ahpra has determined it has an enforceable contract with sufficiently specific performance  obligations to recognise registration fees in accordance with AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. AASB 15 recognition exemption permits accounting for short-term licences or low-value licences with two options:  •	 recognise the revenue associated with those licences at the point in time the licence is issued, or  •	 on a straight-line basis over the licence term or another systematic basis. When a person pays a registration fee, the fee is recognised over the term of the registration.  When a person pays an application fee, the fee is recognised at the point in time the fee is received.  Registrations are payable periodically in advance. Only the portion of registration fees that are attributable to the  current financial year are recognised as revenue. Consideration received in advance of recognising the associated  revenue from registrants is recorded as a contract liability.

During 2023/24, the Health Workforce Taskforce  provided a grant of $0.630 million to fund development  of specialist international medical graduate expedited  pathways under recommendation 9 of the Independent  review of Australia’s regulatory settings relating to  overseas health practitioners (the Kruk review). The Australian Government provided a grant of  $0.195 million to review and update the Prescribing  Competencies Framework to support quality use  of medicine. The grant encompasses activities with  measurable performance obligations. The work is to  be carried out in 2024/25. Grant revenue is recognised when the relevant  services are provided and performance obligations  are met. In 2023/24, Ahpra has recognised a $0.630  million grant received as revenue and $0.195 million  as contract liabilities.

Employee benefits B2. Other operating expenses B3. Other economic flows Introduction This section provides an account of the expenses  incurred by Ahpra in delivering services. Judgement required Judgements have been applied in the calculations of  employee benefits provisions such as likely tenure of  staff, historical patterns of leave claims, future salary  movements and discount rates. Expenses from transactions are recognised in the  Statement of comprehensive income when they  are incurred. Expenses from transactions Note 2024 $'000 2023 $'000 Employee costs B1.1 193,285  176,079  Board and committee sitting fees  5,993   5,778  Legal and notification costs  14,937   14,763  Accreditation expenses   10,851   10,178  Other operating expenses B2  72,843  64,728  Board and committee sitting fees Board and committee sitting fees include costs related  to meetings held by the Ahpra Board as well as those  national, state and territory board meetings held by  the National Boards and their committees. Legal and notification costs Legal costs include external costs relating to managing  Ahpra’s notification (complaint) process. These costs  include legal fees paid to external firms and costs of  civil tribunals. They do not include the costs associated  with Ahpra staff in the assessment and investigation  of notifications or the cost of legal staff employed  by Ahpra. Accreditation expenses Accreditation expenses relate to payments to external  accreditation bodies to exercise accreditation functions,  as defined in section 42 of the National Law. Staff  costs and committee sitting fees when these functions  are carried out by accreditation committees are  not included. Five boards have assigned accreditation functions  under section 42 of the National Law to accreditation  committees administered by Ahpra. Accrediting activities relating to registration of  health practitioners under section 52 of the National  Law are disclosed separately as funding for intern  training accreditation authorities under other  operating expenses. Note B1: Employee benefits Employee costs relate to all Ahpra employment  costs, including wages and salaries, fringe benefits  tax, leave entitlements and on-costs, termination  payments, WorkCover premiums, superannuation  and contractors’ cost.

When the annual leave is expected to wholly settle  within 12 months of the reporting date, it is measured  at its nominal value. Those liabilities not expected to  be wholly settled within 12 months of the reporting  date are measured at the present value of the amounts  expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled  using remuneration rates expected to apply at the  time of settlement. (b) Sick leave No provision has been made for sick leave as all sick  leave is non-vesting. An expense is recognised in the  Statement of comprehensive income as it is taken. (c) Long service leave The long service leave entitlement is recognised  from an employee’s start date and becomes payable  according to the employment arrangements in place.  Long service leave is classified as a current liability  for those employees who have met the conditions  of service to take long service leave, while for those  employees still to meet the conditions of service, it is  classified as a non-current liability. The part of the current liability that is expected to  wholly settle within 12 months of the reporting date  is measured at its nominal value. When liabilities are  not expected to wholly settle within 12 months of the  reporting date, they are measured at the present value  of the expected future payments to employees up to  the reporting date. Consideration is given to expected  future wage and salary levels, experience of employee  departures, and periods of service. Expected future  payments are discounted using the Reserve Bank of  Australia’s 10-year rate for semi-annual coupon bonds,  which is 4.348% as of 30 June 2024 (4.063% as of  30 June 2023). (d) Employee benefits on-costs Employee benefits on-costs such as payroll tax and  the WorkCover insurance premium are not employee  benefits. They are recognised as liabilities when the  employee benefits to which they relate are recognised. (e) Termination benefits Termination benefits are payable when employment is  terminated before the normal retirement date or when  an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange  for these benefits. Ahpra recognises termination benefits  when it is demonstrably committed to either terminating  the employment of current employees according to a  detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal  or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer  made to encourage voluntary redundancy. B1.3 Superannuation contributions The amount expensed for superannuation represents  Ahpra contributions for members of both defined  benefit and defined contribution superannuation plans  that are paid or payable during the reporting period. Financial statements  ===== PAGE 111 ===== 111 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 Ahpra employees and statutory appointees are entitled to receive superannuation benefits and Ahpra contributes to  both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. The defined benefit plans provide benefits based on years of  service and final average salary. Contributions to defined contribution and defined benefit superannuation plans are expensed when incurred. Superannuation contributions paid or payable for the reporting period are included as part of staffing costs in Ahpra’s  Statement of comprehensive income. The reported contributions reflect gross superannuation payments to each of the funds, inclusive of superannuation  guarantee contributions. The name, details and amounts expensed to the major employee and statutory appointees’ superannuation funds and  contributions by Ahpra are as follows: Fund Paid contribution for the year Contribution outstanding at year end 2024 $'000 2023 $'000 2024 $'000 2023 $'000 Defined benefit plans: Southern State Superannuation Scheme 236 225 0 0 QSuper 85 98 1 0 Other (5 funds) 88 96 0 0 Defined contribution plans: Australian Super 6,680 5,747 0 0 Aware Super 1,389 816 0 0 Hesta 661 576 0 0 Hostplus 785 650 0 0 QSuper accumulation 856 737 0 0 Rest Super 666 567 0 0 Sunsuper 598 567 0 0 UniSuper 885 705 0 0 Other (2024: 224 funds, 2023: 225 funds) 4,433 4,416 48 51 Total 17,362 15,200 49 51 Note B2: Other operating expenses 2024 $'000 2023 $'000 Bank charges and merchant fees  1,896   1,568  Consultant costs  11,158   6,048  Criminal history checks  1,336   1,337  External contract services  3,439   7,115  Funding for intern training accreditation  authorities  1,024   966  Health programs  5,360   4,298  Insurance  1,400   1,292  Internal audit fees  267   323  National Health Practitioner Ombudsman  and Privacy Commissioner  3,035   2,890  Office of the Health Ombudsman (OHO, in  Queensland)  7,512   7,324  Printing, postage and publications  474   725  Property expenses   2,872   2,589  Systems and communications 21,318 18,408 Travel and accommodation  9,223   7,379  Other  2,529   2,466  Total other operating expenses 72,843 64,728 Consultant costs Strategic and project consultants are engaged for tasks  requiring specialist skill sets when the skills and capacity  do not normally reside in-house. Such expertise was  procured through consulting services to support Ahpra’s  technology program, and other ad-hoc independent  reviews during the financial year. These expenses are  assessed as not meeting the definition of an asset  under AASB 138 Intangible Assets. External contract services External contract services spend covers a range of  services contracted with external organisations. Health programs Health programs are national schemes financially  supported by the National Boards and operated at  arm’s length. A health program provides telephone and  online services offering health support to practitioners,  contributing to better health and wellbeing for  practitioners, and safer care for the public. Financial statements  ===== PAGE 112 ===== 112 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 National Health Practitioner Ombudsman and  Privacy Commissioner (NHPO) The Ombudsman investigates complaints, facilitates  resolutions and makes recommendations to improve  the regulation of Australia’s registered health  practitioners. The NHPO is funded by registration fees  paid by health practitioners. The Health Chief Executives  Forum approves the budget request from the NHPO  each year and directs Ahpra to pay the approved funds. Property expenses Property expenses include maintenance of leased  properties, variable lease payments such as rates and  outgoings, and offsite storage costs.  In accordance with the AASB 16 Leases, lease payments  for office rental are accounted as depreciation of right- of-use assets and interest on leases (Note E1.2). Variable  lease payments, such as rates and outgoings, which  do not depend on an index or a rate and which are not  in substance fixed, are recognised in the period they  occur as property expenses. Systems and communications Systems and communications costs relate to the  technology systems of Ahpra. The rise in expenses is  attributed to the technology enhancement underway  and the increased cybersecurity protection needs. Travel and accommodation Travel and accommodation relate to flight, taxi and hotel  costs incurred by Ahpra, the National Boards and their  committees for travel costs to attend scheduled board  and committee meetings, as well as supporting the  increased capacity of the objective structured clinical  examination (OSCE) and internationally qualified nurse  and midwife (IQNM) examinations across multiple sites. Other Expenses to administer exams, advertisements, external  audit fees, membership and affiliations, recruitment  costs and venue hire are reported as other expenses. Note B3: Other economic flows Other economic flows are changes in the value of an  asset or liability that do not result from transactions. Net gain/(loss) on financial instruments at fair  value includes: •	 realised and unrealised gains and losses from  revaluations of financial instruments at fair value  •	 disposals of financial assets •	 bad and doubtful debts impairments and  reversals of impairment. 2024 $'000 2023 $'000 Net gain/(loss) on financial instruments at fair value Net gain arising from revaluation of financial  assets at fair value through profit and loss 2,901 3,470 Net doubtful debts recoveries/(write-off) (295) (41) Total net gain on financial instruments at  fair value 2,606 3,429 Other gain/(loss) from other economic flows Net gain arising from revaluation of leave  liability 230 270 Total other gain from other economic flows 230 270 Total gain from other economic flows 2,836 3,699  Note C: Key assets available to  support delivery of services C1.

Depreciation, amortisation and impairment Introduction Ahpra controls property, plant and equipment that are  used in fulfilling our objectives and conducting our  activities. Along with financial assets, they represent  a key resource we use in the delivery of services. Judgement required Financial assets such as units held in the managed  investment scheme are measured at fair value. Non- financial assets such as property, plant and equipment  and intangible assets are carried at cost less  accumulated depreciation and impairment. Judgement  has been applied in assessing the useful lives of plant  and equipment. Note C1: Investments and other  financial assets Ahpra manages its investments and other financial  assets in accordance with the investment policy  approved by the Ahpra Board. Investments include both managed funds and term  deposits that Ahpra has the positive intent and ability  to hold to maturity at fixed or repricing interest rates.  Investments are recognised when Ahpra enters a  contract to purchase the investment. They are measured  at fair value through net result.  Term deposits are classified as current assets with  maturing dates of three to 12 months, while term  deposits with maturing dates in excess of 12 months  are classified as non-current. Investment in managed  investment schemes (funds) are classified as current or  non-current based on Ahpra’s intention at balance date  with respect to the timing of redemption of each asset. 2024 $'000 2023 $'000 Current Bank term deposits maturing in less  than 90 days 43,000 20,000 Bank term deposits maturing in more  than 90 days but less than 1 year   55,000 58,000 Total current investments 98,000 78,000 Non-current Bank term deposits maturing in more  than 1 year  35,000 50,000 Managed investment schemes 92,464 87,242 Total non-current investments 127,464 137,242 Total investments and other  financial assets 225,464 215,242 Financial statements  ===== PAGE 113 ===== 113 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 Note C2: Property, plant and equipment (PPE) Right-of-use  property $’000 Leasehold  improvements $’000 Furniture  and fittings $’000 Computer  equipment $’000 Office  equipment $’000 Work in  progress $’000 Total property, plant  and equipment $’000 At cost Balance at 1 July 2022 58,111 16,298 1,468 9,238 387 0 85,502 Additions 98 5161 371 1,784 14 0 2,783 Disposals/write-offs 0 0 0 (1,547) 0 0 (1,547) Balance at 30 June 2023 58,209 16,814 1,839 9,475 401 0 86,738 Additions 0 0 0 0 0 6,993 6,993 Disposals/write-offs 0 (3,943) (388) (283) (188) 0 (4,802) Transfer to additions 113 28 3 842 26 (1,012) 0 Balance at 30 June 2024 58,322 12,899 1,454 10,034 239 5,981 88,929 Accumulated depreciation  Balance at 1 July 2022 (21,601) (10,467) (897) (8,054) (236) 0 (41,255) Depreciation charge  during the year (7,503) (1,355) (179) (1,163) (40) 0 (10,240) Disposals/write-offs 0 0 0 1,547 0 0 1,547 Balance at 30 June 2023 (29,104) (11,822) (1,076) (7,670) (276) 0 (49,948) Depreciation charge  during the year (7,486) (1,356) (211) (1,354) (40) 0 (10,447) Disposals/write-offs 0 3,938 330 282 151 0 4,701 Balance at 30 June 2024 (36,590) (9,240) (957) (8,742) (165) 0 (55,694) Net book value At 30 June 2023 29,105 4,992 763 1,805 125 0 36,791 At 30 June 2024 21,732 3,659 497 1,292 74 5,981 33,235 1.	 This includes $9k completed projects transferred in from work in progress. Items of plant, equipment and leasehold improvements are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation  and impairment. C2.1: Right-of-use assets For any contracts entered into or changed, Ahpra  considers whether a contract is, or contains, a lease.  A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys  the right to control the use of an identified asset for a  period of time in exchange for consideration. To apply  this definition, Ahpra assesses whether the contract  meets three key criteria: •	 The contract involves the use of an identified asset •	 Ahpra has the right to obtain substantially all  of the economic benefits from use of the asset  throughout the period of use, and •	 Ahpra has the right to direct the use of the asset. As a lessee, Ahpra recognises a right-of-use asset and  a lease liability at the lease commencement date.  The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost,  which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability  adjusted for: •	 less any lease payments made at or before the  commencement date •	 plus any initial direct costs incurred •	 plus any estimate of costs to dismantle and  remove the underlying assets or to restore  the underlying asset or the site the asset is  located on •	 less any lease incentive received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently measured at  cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment.  It is depreciated using the straight-line method from  the commencement date to the earlier of the end of  the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the  lease term, ranging from two to 12 years. The estimated  useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the  same basis as those of property, plant and equipment.  In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced  by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain  remeasurements of the lease liability. During 2023/24, Ahpra extended lease for a fleet of  photocopiers for another year. A right-of-use asset was  added accordingly. All existing office leases remain  active. The Melbourne office lease is due to expire in  October 2024. The new office fit-out work is currently  in progress with an estimated completion date in  September 2024. Note C3: Intangible assets Purchased intangible assets are initially recognised  at cost. When the recognition criteria in AASB 138  Intangible Assets are met, internally generated  intangible assets are recognised and measured  at cost less accumulated amortisation and  accumulated impairment. An internally generated intangible asset arising  from development (or from the development phase  of an internal project) is recognised if, and only if,  all of the following are demonstrated: 1.	 the technical feasibility of completing the  intangible asset so that it will be available  for use or sale 2.	 an intention to complete the intangible asset  and use it 3.	 the ability to use the intangible asset 4.	 the intangible asset will generate probable  future economic benefits Financial statements  ===== PAGE 114 ===== 114 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 5.	 the availability of adequate technical,  financial and other resources to complete the  development and to use the intangible asset 6.	 the ability to measure reliably the expenditure  attributable to the intangible asset during its  development. Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an  expense in the period in which it is incurred. Ahpra’s intangible assets are mainly internally developed  software to enable and enhance operations. These  assets are carried at cost less impairment and are  not amortised until the software is ready for use.  The balance at 30 June 2024 was $16.753 million  (2023: $12.529 million).

Note C4: Depreciation, amortisation and  impairment Plant and equipment are measured at cost less  accumulated depreciation and impairment. These  assets are depreciated at rates based on their  expected useful lives, using the straight-line method,  which is reviewed annually. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the  shorter of the remaining term of the lease or their  estimated useful lives. Work in progress is not depreciated until it reaches  service delivery capacity.

If there is an indication of  impairment, the asset concerned is tested as to whether  its carrying amount exceeds its possible recoverable  amount. Any difference is written off as an expense  (other operating expenses – other). The net gain or loss arising from the sale of non-financial  assets is included as revenue (other income and  revenue) or expenses (other operating expenses – other)  at the date control passes to the buyer, usually when an  unconditional contract of sale is signed.	 The net gain or loss on disposal is calculated as the  difference between the carrying amount of the asset  at the time of the disposal and the net proceeds  on disposal.

They are initially recognised at fair  value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.  Ahpra holds the contractual receivables with the  objective to collect the contractual cash flows and  thereafter measure them at amortised cost using the  effective interest method, less any impairment. Statutory receivables do not arise from contracts  and are recognised and measured similarly to  contractual receivables (except for impairment), but  are not classified as financial instruments for disclosure  purposes. Ahpra applies AASB 9 Financial Instruments for  initial measurement of the statutory receivables and, as a  result, statutory receivables are initially recognised at fair  value plus any directly attributable transaction cost. Details about Ahpra’s impairment policies, its exposure  to credit risk and the calculation of the credit loss  allowance are set out in Note F1.2.

Accounts  payable represent liabilities for goods and services  provided to Ahpra prior to the end of the financial year  that are unpaid. Statutory payables are recognised and measured  similarly to contractual payables, but are not classified  as financial instruments and not included in the category  of financial liabilities at amortised cost because they do  not arise from contracts. Payables for suppliers and services have an average  credit period of 30 days. No interest is charged on the  trade creditors.  Terms and conditions of amounts payable to the  government and agencies vary according to the  particular agreements.

It is then recognised as expenditure in the  period to which the service relates. With respect to the configuration and customisation  costs incurred in implementing SaaS arrangements,  Ahpra management made the following key judgements,  in line with accounting policy, that have the most  significant effect on the amounts recognised in the  financial statements. Financial statements  ===== PAGE 116 ===== 116 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 Determination whether configuration and  customisation services are distinct from the  SaaS access Implementation costs including costs to configure or  customise the cloud provider’s application software are  recognised as operating expenses when the services  are received. Where the SaaS arrangement supplier  provides both configuration and customisation services,  judgement has been applied to determine whether each  of these services are distinct or not from the underlying  use of the SaaS application.  Specifically, where the configuration and customisation  activities significantly modify or customise the cloud  software, these activities are not distinct from the  access to the cloud software over the contract term.  Judgement has been applied in determining whether  the degree of customisation and modification of the  cloud-based software is significant. Ahpra assessed  these activities as not distinct from access to the SaaS  platform over the contract term. At the end of FY2023/24, Ahpra recognised $8.365  million ($3.672 million in FY2022/23) as prepayments  in respect of configuration and customisation activities  undertaken in implementing SaaS arrangements which  are considered not to be distinct from access to the  SaaS application software over the contract term. Ahpra  also recognised $2.245 million (FY2022/23 $2.669  million) in prepayments for SaaS-related licence fees  paid in advance.

The amount recognised as a  provision is the best estimate of the consideration  required to settle the present obligation at the  reporting date, taking into account the risks and  uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Make-good provisions are recognised when Ahpra  has contractual obligations to remove leasehold  improvements from leased properties and restore the  leased premises to their original condition at the end  of the lease term. During the calculation of make-good  provisions, assumptions and estimations have been  applied to work out the average make-good cost per  square metre when ongoing maintenance and updating  is committed to, and/or the local market conditions  in re-negotiating an incentive at lease expiration for  each office.

Leases E2. Cash flow information and balances E3. Commitments Introduction This section provides information on the sources of  finance utilised by Ahpra during its operations and  other information related to financing activities of Ahpra. Judgement required Ahpra applies judgement to determine if a contract is  or contains a lease and whether the lease meets the  short-term or low-value asset lease exemption. Ahpra  estimates the discount rate applied to future lease  payments and assesses the lease term when there is  an option to extend or terminate leases. Note E1: Leases A lease is defined as a contract, or part of a contract,  that conveys the right for Ahpra to use an asset for a  period of time in exchange for payment. To apply this definition, Ahpra ensures the contract  meets the following criteria: •	 The contract contains an identified asset, which  is either explicitly identified in the contract or  implicitly specified by being identified at the  time the asset is made available to Ahpra and for  which the supplier does not have substantive  substitution rights. •	 Ahpra has the right to obtain substantially all of  the economic benefits from use of the identified  asset throughout the period of use, considering  its rights within the defined scope of the  contract, and Ahpra has the right to direct the  use of the identified asset throughout the period  of use. •	 Ahpra has the right to take decisions in respect  of ‘how and for what purpose’ the asset is used  throughout the period of use. Ahpra’s lease arrangements consist of various properties  for office operations in each state and territory. The  lease contracts are typically made for fixed periods of  two to 12 years, with an option to renew the lease after  that date. All leases are recognised on the balance sheet, with the  exception of low-value leases (less than $10,000) and  short-term leases of less than 12 months. The payments  in relation to these are recognised as an expense on a  straight-line basis over the lease term.

Lease liabilities include fit-out incentives of $3.203 million  (FY2022/23: $4.177 million) and $25.757 million (FY2022/23:  $33.017 million) from lease accounting implementation,  both to be amortised over lease terms. E1.3 Recognition and measurement of leases as  a lessee The lease liability is initially measured at the  present value of the lease payments unpaid at the  commencement date, discounted using Ahpra’s  incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments included in the measurement of the  lease liabilities comprise fixed payments less any  lease incentive receivable, plus payments arising  from lease extension options reasonably certain to be  exercised. Variable lease payments are not included in  the measurement of the lease liability or the carrying  amount of the right-of-use asset. In determining the lease term, management considers  all facts and circumstances that create an economic  incentive to exercise an extension option. South  Australia and Tasmania office leases contain five-year  extension options which have been included in the lease  term and lease liability because the lease is reasonably  certain to be extended. The assessment is reviewed if a significant event  or a significant change in circumstances occurs  which affects this assessment and that is within the  control of the lessee. Subsequent to initial measurement, the liability will  be reduced for payments made and increased for  interest. It is remeasured to reflect any reassessment  or modification, or if there are changes to in-substance  fixed payments. When the lease liability is remeasured,  a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying  amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit  or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is  already reduced to zero. AASB 16 Leases requires the recognition of a right-of- use asset and lease liability at the lease commencement  date. This is the date the lessor makes the underlying  asset (office space) available for the lessee’s (Ahpra’s)  use. The lease commencement date refers to the  specific date when the lease term begins, and the  lessee takes possession of the leased property for  its intended use. Ahpra has signed an 11-year lease  for the Melbourne office, with lease commencement  date 1 September 2024. A right-of-use asset and lease  liability will be recognised accordingly in FY2024/25.  The lease’s full contractual amount is disclosed as a  commitment in FY2023/24.

Financial instruments F2. Financial risk management F3. Contingent assets and liabilities Introduction Ahpra is exposed to risk from its activities and outside  factors. In addition, it is often necessary to make  judgements and estimates associated with recognition  and measurement of items in the financial statements.  This section sets out financial-instrument-specific  information, including exposures to financial risks,  as well as those items that are contingent in nature or  require a higher level of judgement to be applied, which  for Ahpra related mainly to fair value determination. Note F1: Financial instruments Financial instruments arise out of contractual  agreements that give rise to a financial asset of one  entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of  another entity. Certain financial assets and financial  liabilities arise under statute rather than contract. Such  financial assets and financial liabilities do not meet the  definition of financial instruments in AASB 132 Financial  Instruments: Presentation. F1.1: Categories of contractual financial  instruments Categories of contractual financial instruments under  AASB 9 include: Financial assets at amortised cost Financial assets in this category are held by Ahpra to  collect the contractual cash flows, and the assets’  contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are  solely payments of principal and interest. These assets  are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly  attributable transaction costs and are subsequently  measured at amortised cost using the effective  interest method less any impairment. Ahpra recognises the following financial assets at  amortised cost: •	 cash and cash equivalents •	 term deposit investments •	 contractual receivables •	 accrued interest income on term deposit  investments. Financial assets at fair value through  profit and loss Financial assets in this category are held by Ahpra to  achieve its objective by collecting both: •	 the distributions based on the earnings from the  fund’s assets over the period and may include  income from share dividends, distribution income  from units held in fund investment, rent from  property or interest from cash investments less  any costs, and •	 capital growth from the revaluation of the units  held in managed fund investments. Ahpra recognises the following financial asset at fair  value through profit and loss: •	 managed fund investments. Financial liabilities at amortised cost Financial instrument liabilities are recognised on the  date they originate. They are initially measured at fair  value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.  Subsequent to initial recognition, these liabilities  are measured at amortised cost with any difference  between the initial recognised amount and the  redemption value being recognised in the Statement of  comprehensive income over the period of the interest- bearing liability, using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest method is a method of calculating  the amortised cost of a debt instrument and of  allocating interest expense in net result over the relevant  period. The effective interest is the internal rate of return  of the financial asset or liability. That is, it is the rate  that exactly discounts the estimated future cash flows  through the expected life of the instrument to the net  carrying amount at initial recognition. A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation  under the liability is discharged, is cancelled or expires. Ahpra recognises the following as financial liabilities at  amortised cost: •	 contractual payables •	 lease liabilities. F1.2: Impairment of financial assets Ahpra records the allowance for expected credit loss  for the relevant financial instruments applying AASB 9’s  Expected Credit Loss (ECL) approach. Subject to AASB  9, impairment assessment includes Ahpra’s contractual  receivables. Cash and cash equivalents are also subject  to the impairment requirements of AASB 9, but the  identified impairment loss was immaterial.  Credit loss allowance is classified as other economic  flows in the net result. Contractual receivables are  written off when there is no reasonable expectation  of recovery and impairment losses are classified as a  transaction expense. Subsequent recoveries of amounts  previously written off are credited against the same  line item.  Financial statements  ===== PAGE 119 ===== 119 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 Ahpra applies the AASB 9 simplified approach for  contractual receivables to measure expected credit  losses using a lifetime expected loss allowance based on  the assumptions about risk of default and expected loss  rates. The loss allowance is measured in the same period  as an asset is recognised. Ahpra has grouped contractual  receivables on shared credit risk characteristics and  days past due and selected the expected credit loss  rate based on the agency’s history and existing market  conditions, as well as forward‑looking estimates at the  end of the financial year. Note F2: Financial risk management The main purpose in holding financial instruments is to  prudentially manage Ahpra’s financial risks within the  financial risk management policy parameters. Ahpra’s  main financial risks include credit risk, liquidity risk and  interest rate risk. Ahpra’s exposure to foreign exchange  rate risk and equity price risk is through managed  investment schemes. (a) Credit risk exposure Credit risk is the risk that a party will fail to fulfil its  obligations to Ahpra, resulting in financial loss. The  maximum exposure to credit risk, excluding the value  of any collateral or other security at balance date, is the  carrying amount, net of any provisions for impairment  of those assets, as disclosed in the Statement of financial  position and notes to the financial statements. Credit  risk associated with Ahpra’s contractual financial assets  is minimal because Ahpra mainly obtains contractual  financial assets that are term deposits and cash at bank. Ahpra is exposed to credit risk in relation to units  held in managed investment schemes (managed  fund) that is designated at fair value through the  operating statement. The maximum exposure at the  end of the reporting period is the carrying amount  of the investments.  Ahpra term deposit investments are in line with the  investment policy and maintained with banks with credit  ratings of AA- or above. Ahpra does not have more than  40% of term deposits with one individual bank. Except as otherwise detailed in the following table,  the carrying amount of contractual financial assets  recorded in the financial statements, net of any  allowances for losses, represents Ahpra’s maximum  exposure to credit risk.

Contractual receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery and impairment losses  are classified as a transaction expense. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against  the same line item. Ahpra’s statutory receivable relates to GST input tax receivables. No loss allowance was recognised at 30 June 2024  under AASB 9 Financial instruments. (b) Liquidity risk exposure Liquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities  as they fall due. Ahpra manages liquidity risk by monitoring cash flows’ forecast and ensuring that adequate liquid  funds are available to meet current obligations. Ahpra’s exposure to liquidity risk is deemed insignificant based on prior period’s data and current assessment of risk.  Cash for unexpected events is generally sourced from liquidation of available-to-recall term deposits.

The total amount disclosed here excludes statutory amounts (e.g. payroll tax payable). 2.	 Contractual amounts disclosed in the maturity analysis are the contractual undiscounted cash flows. For lease liabilities, it is gross  lease obligation before deducting finance costs and excludes lease fit-out incentive of $3,203k (2023: $4,177k). The maximum exposure to liquidity risk is the total carrying amount of the financial liabilities as shown above. (c) Performance risk exposure Investing in managed funds provides access to different  asset classes and industry sectors; however there is  always a risk that the managed fund investments may  underperform or decline in value. Ahpra is exposed  to fluctuations in the performance of the underlying  financial assets held within managed funds in which  Ahpra holds units. Ahpra monitors the managed funds’  investment strategy and asset allocation against Ahpra’s  own investment policy risk tolerances. Interest rate risk Exposure to interest rate risk is limited to assets bearing  variable interest rates. Ahpra has a combination of  deposits with floating and fixed interest rates. Exposure  to variable interest rate risk is with financial institutions  with AA- credit rating.3 3.	 Standard & Poor’s rated AA-. Moody’s Investors Service  rated Aa3. Fitch rated A+.

Sensitivity analysis Taking into account past performance, future expectations, economic forecasts, and management’s knowledge and  experience of the financial markets, Ahpra can’t predict market rates and the below is for illustrative purposes only: A parallel shift of +0.25% and -0.75% (2023: +0.50% and -0.50%) in market interest rates (AUD) from year-end rates  of 4.71% and 4.30%, reflecting the Reserve Bank’s intention to manage inflation within its target range of 2% and 3%  while continuing to support economic growth and maintain stability. The following tables disclose the impact on net operating result and equity for each category of financial instrument  held by Ahpra at year end. Investments which have a fixed rate of return over the next 12 months are assessed as not  subject to the market interest rates shift. Investments which will mature during the next 12 months or are invested in  floating rates of return are assessed accordingly for the impacts on net operation result and equity.

Contingent liabilities 2024 $'000 2023 $'000 Legal proceedings and disputes 0 0 F2.1: Fair value determination Fair value is the price that would be received to sell  an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly  transaction between market participants at the  measurement date. In determining fair values, a number of inputs are  used. To increase consistency and comparability in the  financial statements, these inputs are categorised into  three levels, known as the fair value hierarchy. The levels  are as follows: •	 Level 1 – the fair value of financial instruments  with standard terms and conditions and traded  in active liquid markets are determined with  reference to quoted market prices. •	 Level 2 – the fair value is determined using  inputs other than quoted prices that are  observable for the financial asset or liability,  either directly or indirectly. •	 Level 3 – the fair value is determined in  accordance with generally accepted pricing  models based on discounted cash flow analysis  using unobservable market inputs. Ahpra’s managed fund investments are facilitated by  the Victorian Funds Management Corporation in its  Conservative Fund using Level 2 valuation. It has quoted  market and redemption price. The daily net asset value  (NAV) is directly observed and is the net value of the  fund’s assets less its liabilities, divided by the number  of units on issue. The NAV of these funds is considered  a reasonable input used to measure their fair value. Ahpra considers the carrying amount of financial  instrument assets and liabilities recorded in the financial  statements to be a fair approximation of their fair  values, because of the short-term nature of the financial  instruments and the expectation that they will be settled  in full. The following table shows that the fair values of the  contractual financial assets and liabilities are the same  as the carrying amounts. Contingent assets and contingent liabilities are not recognised in the Statement of financial position, but are disclosed  by way of note and, if quantifiable, are measured at nominal value. Contingent assets and contingent liabilities are  presented inclusive of GST receivable or payable respectively. Contingent assets and liabilities are possible assets and obligations that arise from past events, whose existence will  be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the  control of Ahpra.  Contingent liabilities could also be present obligations arising from past events but are not recognised when it is not  probable that an outflow of resource embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligations, or the  amount of the obligations cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.  Claims for damages were lodged during the year. Liabilities have been disclaimed and the actions have been  defended. Insurers are involved in defending these matters. An outflow of funds in excess of insurance may be  required if the case outcomes are less favourable than currently expected.

On 20 July 2023, Health Ministers resolved to issue this policy direction to clarify Ministerial  Council expectations of the Australian Medical Council and medical colleges regarding  accreditation of training sites and to direct Ahpra and the Medical Board to note these  expectations when exercising their functions for the purposes of the National Law.  Health Ministers acknowledge the critical role medical colleges have in the education and  training of the medical specialist workforce but have noted that the colleges could be better  aligned with workforce reform priorities to ensure patients can access the care they need and  want, in a safe environment.   The Australian Medical Council Standards for Assessment and Accreditation of Specialist  Medical Programs outline minimum high-level requirements for the accreditation of specialist  training sites by medical colleges. In particular, Standard 1.6.3 states that: “The education  provider works with training sites and jurisdictions on matters of mutual interest”.  Each  medical college has its own accreditation standards, processes and terminology for training  site accreditation. As a result, there is lack of standardisation and significant variation of  accreditation processes, procedures, and timeframes between colleges.   Accreditation decisions, including withdrawal of accreditation, have a significant impact on  the availability of medical workforce at sites/locations, which in turn, has a significant impact  on patients through reduced services.  Each College has policies, processes and timeframes  to follow should an organisation seek review of an accreditation decision.  Health Ministers had also previously requested the National Health Practitioner Ombudsman  conduct a review of the procedural aspects of accreditation including both accreditation  authorities and specialist medical colleges. On 20 July 2023 Ministers received an interim  update from the Ombudsman outlining potential reform options.     Policy direction  ===== PAGE 127 ===== 127 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 The policy direction is as follows:   1.  That Ahpra and the Medical Board of Australia require that:  a) The Australian Medical Council works with jurisdictions and medical colleges on an  implementation plan regarding the National Health Practitioner Ombudsman’s  suggestions for reform on arrangements for training site accreditation.  b) The Australian Medical Council works with jurisdictions and medical colleges to  develop a communication protocol to clarify and confirm the roles and responsibilities  of all parties in the training and supply of the medical workforce and the distribution  of that workforce.   c) The Australian Medical Council reviews existing arrangements:  i.  to achieve greater consistency of accreditation processes, policies, procedures and  decisions for training site accreditation across the medical specialist colleges.   ii.  that the scope of medical college accreditation of training sites, standards and  decisions is clarified to matters relevant to the delivery of high quality education  and training of medical specialist trainees.  d) The Australian Medical Council works with medical colleges on training site  accreditation arrangements to reduce the impact on patient services caused by  withdrawal of training site accreditation and reduced workforce. This includes  developing a uniform process to be adopted by all medical colleges in relation to  accreditation decisions and review processes.  In line with section 17 of the National Law it is requested that this direction be published by  Ahpra and the Medical Board of Australia on their websites as soon as practicable.

The  accreditation authority may be a committee established  by a National Board, or a separate organisation.  adjudication body  A health panel, a performance and professional  standards panel, a responsible tribunal, a court or an  entity in a co-regulatory jurisdiction that is declared to  be an adjudication body.  appeal A person may appeal to a tribunal against a decision  by a National Board, a health panel or a performance  and professional standards panel. Decisions may also  be judicially reviewed if there is a perceived flaw in the  administrative decision-making process, as opposed to a  concern about the merits of the individual decision itself.  breach of non-offence provision under the  National Law  Ahpra receives notifications alleging that a practitioner  has breached a registration standard or endorsement,  breached a condition on registration or an undertaking  accepted by a National Board, or provided care  beyond scope of practice. In these matters, the Board  has the option to take regulatory action. They are not  offences under the National Law.  caution  A formal caution may be issued by a National Board  or an adjudication body. A caution is intended to act  as a deterrent so that the practitioner does not repeat  the conduct. A caution is not usually recorded on the  Register of practitioners; however, a National Board  can require a caution to be recorded on the Register  of practitioners.  condition  A National Board or an adjudication body can impose  a condition on the registration of a practitioner or  student, or on an endorsement of registration. A  condition aims to restrict practice in some way, to  protect the public.  Current conditions are published on the Register of  practitioners. When a National Board or adjudication  body decides the conditions are no longer required  to ensure safe practice, they are removed and no  longer published.  Examples include requiring a practitioner to:  •	 complete specified further education or training  within a specified period  •	 complete a specified period of supervised  practice  •	 do, or refrain from doing, something in  connection with the practitioner’s practice  •	 manage their practice in a specified way  •	 report to a specified person at specified times  about the practitioner’s practice, or  •	 not employ, engage or recommend a specified  person, or class of persons.  There may also be conditions related to a practitioner’s  health, such as psychiatric care or drug screening.  The details of health conditions are not usually published  on the Register of practitioners. Also see the definition  of undertaking.  criminal offence  Criminal offences under the National Law by a  person (including registered health practitioners and  unregistered individuals) and/or corporate entity  predominantly relate to breaching prohibition orders,  inappropriate use of protected titles, unlawful claims  about registration, performing restricted acts, and  advertising of regulated health services.  Ahpra also receives notifications about practitioners  who have been charged or convicted of an offence  contained in a law other than the National Law, such as  a criminal law. A Board may take action if the nature of  the offence may affect the practitioner’s suitability to  practise the profession.  disciplinary action  Regulatory action taken by a performance and  professional standards panel or a tribunal after it  decides that:  •	 a practitioner has engaged in unprofessional  conduct, unsatisfactory professional performance  or professional misconduct  •	 a practitioner’s registration was improperly  obtained.  division  Part of a health profession. A practitioner can be  registered in more than one division within a profession.  Not all professions have divisions.  For more information, refer to the list published at  www.ahpra.gov.au/registration/registers-of- practitioners/professions-and-divisions. education provider  A university, tertiary education institution, specialist  medical or other health-profession college that provides  a program of study.  endorsement  An endorsement of registration recognises that a person  has an extended scope of practice in a particular area  because they have an additional qualification that is  approved by the National Board.  There are many types of endorsement available,  including:  •	 scheduled medicines  •	 nurse practitioner  •	 acupuncture  •	 approved area of practice.  In psychology, these are divided into ‘subtypes’ that  describe additional qualifications and expertise. An  endorsement can include more than one subtype.  health complaints organisation (HCO)  National Boards are provided with copies of all concerns  about registered health practitioners that are made to  an HCO.  Glossary  ===== PAGE 130 ===== A National Board may talk to the HCO about the  complaint and refer it to the HCO if they are the  appropriate entity to deal with it.  HCO decisions, made on receipt of concerns, are not  defined as regulatory action and are counted and  reported on separately in the report.  The HCOs in each state and territory are listed at www. ahpra.gov.au/Notifications/Further-information/Health -complaints-organisations. They are also known as health  complaints entities (HCEs).  health impairment  Physical or mental impairment, disability, condition or  disorder (including substance abuse or dependence)  that detrimentally affects, or is likely to detrimentally  affect, a registered health practitioner’s capacity to  safely practise the profession or a student’s capacity  to do clinical training. immediate action  Also referred to as interim action. This can be taken as an  interim step to restrict a practitioner’s registration while  a complaint is investigated. Immediate actions include:  •	 the suspension of, or imposition of a condition  on, a registered health practitioner’s or student’s  registration •	 accepting an undertaking from a registered  health practitioner or student  •	 accepting the surrender of a registered health  practitioner’s or student’s registration.  mandatory notification It is mandatory that colleagues, treating practitioners,  employers or education providers of a registered  practitioner or student submit a notification about them  if they have behaved in a way that constitutes notifiable  conduct. Refer to each Board’s website for Guidelines  for mandatory notifications.  Ministerial Council  Defined in the National Law as ‘the COAG [Council of  Australian Governments] Health Council or a successor  of the Council by whatever name called, constituted  by Ministers of the governments of the participating  jurisdictions and the Commonwealth with portfolio  responsibility for health’.  National Board  Appointed by the Ministerial Council to regulate  a profession in the public interest and meet the  responsibilities set down in the National Law. Comprising  practitioner members and community members, National  Boards and/or state boards and/or committees are  delegated the functions/powers of the National Board.  National Law  The Act adopted in each state and territory setting out  the provisions of the Health Practitioner Regulation  National Law. The National Law is generally consistent in  all states and territories. New South Wales did not adopt  Part 8 of the National Law.  National Registration and Accreditation Scheme The National Scheme for registered health practitioners  was established by the Council of Australian  Governments (COAG) under the National Law. The  scheme began on 1 July 2010 (or 18 October 2010 in  Western Australia). In 2010, 10 professions became  nationally regulated by a corresponding National Board.  In 2012, four additional professions joined the National  Scheme. In 2017, the Paramedicine Board of Australia was  established and the regulation of paramedics began in  late 2018.  National Restrictions Library (NRL)  Lists common restrictions (conditions or undertakings)  used across the regulatory functions of the National  Boards to support:  •	 consistency in recommendations from Ahpra to  the National Boards and delegates  •	 consistency in the restrictions appearing on the  Register of practitioners  •	 a best-practice approach to monitoring  compliance with restrictions.  The NRL is available at www.ahpra.gov.au/registration/ monitoring-and-compliance/national-restrictions-library.  no conviction recorded  An outcome that is available to a court after a plea  or finding of guilt. This is a common outcome for first  offenders for ‘low level’ offences, which reflects the  willingness of the legislature and the community to  give first offenders, in certain circumstances, a second  chance to maintain a reputation of good character.  no further action  No further action is taken when, based on the available  information, the Board determines there is no risk to the  public that requires regulatory action.  notation  Records a limitation on the practice of a registrant. Used  by National Boards to describe and explain the scope  of a practitioner’s practice by noting the limitations  on that practice. The notation does not change the  practitioner’s scope of practice but may reflect the  requirements of a registration standard.  notifiable conduct  When a registered health practitioner has:  •	 practised their profession while intoxicated by  alcohol or drugs  •	 engaged in sexual misconduct in connection with  the practice of their profession  •	 placed the public at risk of substantial harm in the  practice of their profession because they have an  impairment, or  •	 placed the public at risk of harm because the  practitioner has practised the profession in a  way that constitutes a significant departure from  accepted professional standards.  notification  Any person or organisation can raise a concern about a  registered health practitioner’s behaviour or health with  Ahpra on behalf of a National Board. A notification is a concern about a practitioner or  student relating to a matter that is a ground for a  notification under the National Law.  National Boards gather information contained in  notifications to help identify risks in the way an  individual practitioner is practising a health profession.  Concerns can be raised by contacting Ahpra on  1300 419 495 (within Australia), +61 3 9125 3010 (outside  Australia) or at www.ahpra.gov.au/notifications.  In response to a notification, a Board may:  •	 store the information provided in a notification,  and take no further action on that occasion, or  •	 make further enquiries in relation to a  practitioner, by investigating the practitioner or  requiring the practitioner to attend a health or  performance assessment.  Glossary 130 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24  ===== PAGE 131 ===== 131 Ahpra and the National Boards annual report 2023/24 After making necessary enquiries in response to a  notification and considering the information, a National  Board or independent adjudication body may decide to  take regulatory action.  notifier  A person or entity who makes a notification to Ahpra.  practice  The definition of practice used in a number of National  Board registration standards means any role, whether  remunerated or not, in which an individual uses  their skills and knowledge as a practitioner in their  regulated health profession. Practice is not restricted  to the provision of direct clinical care. It also includes  using professional knowledge in a direct non-clinical  relationship with patients or clients; working in  management, administration, education, research,  advisory, regulatory or policy development roles; and  any other roles that affect the safe, effective delivery of  health services in the health profession.  Some National Boards have also issued guidance about  when practitioners need to be registered.  principal place of practice  The location declared by a practitioner as the address  at which they mostly practise their profession. If the  practitioner is not practising, or not practising mostly at  one address, then the practitioner’s principal place of  residence is used.  If the location of the principal place of practice is in  Australia, the following information is displayed on the  Register of practitioners:  •	 suburb  •	 state  •	 postcode.  If the location is outside Australia, the following  information is displayed on the Register of practitioners:  •	 international state/province  •	 international postcode  •	 country.  In rare cases, when a practitioner has demonstrated  that the health and safety of themselves or their  family members or associates may be at risk from the  publication of information about their principal place of  practice, a National Board may choose to not publish  this information.  prohibited practitioner/student  A person who is being monitored because they  are subject to a cancellation order, suspension or a  restriction not to practise. Alternatively, as an outcome  of a notification they may have surrendered their  registration or changed to non-practising registration.  qualification Professional qualifications that a practitioner must have  to meet the requirements for registration. Undergraduate  and postgraduate Australian qualifications recognised  by National Boards are published on their websites.  Individual practitioners’ approved qualifications are  published on the Register of practitioners.  Register of practitioners  A publicly accessible database of all health practitioners  currently registered in Australia. Ahpra also maintains a  list of cancelled practitioners and a list of practitioners  who have given an undertaking not to practise. You  can search these databases at www.ahpra.gov.au/ registration/registers-of-practitioners.  registered health practitioner  An individual who is registered under the National Law  to practise a health profession, other than as a student,  or who holds a non-practising registration in a health  profession.  registration expiry date  The date when a practitioner’s current registration  expires. Practitioners must apply to renew their  registration annually. If the practitioner’s name appears  on the Register of practitioners, they are registered  and can practise within the scope of their registration,  consistent with any conditions or undertakings  that apply.  During the renewal period, practitioners remain  registered for one month after their registration expiry  date where they fail to lodge an application for renewal.  Registrants who apply to renew can continue to practise  while their application is being assessed.  registration number  Since March 2012, practitioners have been allocated  a unique registration number for each profession in  which they are registered. This number stays with the  practitioner for life, even if they have periods when they  are not registered.  registration status  The status of a registration can be:  •	 Registered: The practitioner is registered. The  practitioner’s name is published on the Register  of practitioners. •	 Suspended: The practitioner is not permitted  to practise while suspended. The practitioner’s  name is published on the Register of  practitioners.  •	 Cancelled: The registration has been cancelled  and the practitioner is not permitted to practise.  The practitioner’s name is not published on the  Register of practitioners but is published on the  list of cancelled practitioners.  registration type  A National Board can grant various types of registration  to an eligible practitioner. Examples include: •	 general registration •	 limited registration •	 non-practising registration  •	 provisional registration •	 specialist registration. regulatory action  Action taken by a National Board that affects a  practitioner’s registration. It can be taken if a Board  reasonably believes that a practitioner:  •	 has practised in a way that is or may be below  the standard reasonably expected  •	 has behaved in a way that is or may be below the  standard reasonably expected of the practitioner  by the public or the practitioner’s peers  •	 has or may have an impairment that could  detrimentally affect a practitioner’s ability to  practise safely.  The regulatory actions that can be taken by a National  Board are:  •	 cautioning a practitioner  •	 accepting an undertaking  •	 imposing a condition.  Glossary  ===== PAGE 132 ===== Regulatory action can also be taken by a health panel, a  performance and professional standards panel (PPSP) or  a tribunal after it decides that:  •	 a practitioner has an impairment  •	 a practitioner has engaged in unprofessional  conduct or unsatisfactory professional  performance  •	 a practitioner has engaged in professional  misconduct (tribunal only)  •	 a practitioner’s registration was improperly  obtained (tribunal only).  The regulatory actions that can be taken by a health  panel, PPSP or a tribunal are:  •	 imposing a condition  •	 cautioning a practitioner (PPSP or tribunal)  •	 reprimanding a practitioner for practising or  behaving in a certain way (PPSP or tribunal)  •	 requiring a practitioner to pay a fine (tribunal  only)  •	 suspending a practitioner’s registration for a  period of time (health panel or tribunal)  •	 cancelling a practitioner’s registration, either  temporarily or permanently (tribunal only)  •	 disqualifying a person from applying for  registration for a specified time (tribunal only)  •	 prohibiting the person from providing a health  service or using a title (tribunal only).  reprimand  A chastisement for conduct; a formal rebuke.  Reprimands issued since the start of the National  Scheme are published on the Register of practitioners.  specialty  There are currently three professions with specialist  registration: dental, medical and podiatry. The Ministerial  Council is responsible for approving a list of specialties  for each profession and for approving one or more  specialist titles for each specialty. The National Boards  decide the requirements for specialist registration in  their profession.  spent conviction order  A court order that a criminal conviction is spent  immediately. This means that the conviction does not  need to be disclosed in many circumstances and the  conviction will never appear on a standard National  Police Clearance. However, the conviction still needs  to be disclosed in some circumstances; for example,  Working with Children Checks and when applying for  registration as a health practitioner.  standard Registration standards define the requirements that  applicants, registrants or students need to meet to be  registered as a health practitioner.  student  A person whose name is entered in a student register  as being currently registered as a student practitioner  under the National Law.  suspension  If a practitioner’s registration is suspended, they are  not eligible to practise. A tribunal has the power to  suspend a practitioner’s registration as a result of a  hearing. A National Board also has the power to suspend  a practitioner’s registration pending other assessment or  action, if it believes:  •	 there is serious risk to the health and safety of  the public from the practitioner’s continued  practice of the profession, and that suspension is  necessary to protect the public from that risk, or  •	 there are public interest grounds for suspending  a practitioner’s registration; for example, when  the practitioner has been charged with serious  criminal conduct.  A health panel can suspend a practitioner’s registration  if the panel finds that the practitioner (or student)  has an impairment and it is necessary to suspend the  practitioner’s registration to protect the public.  undertaking  The National Boards can accept an undertaking from a  practitioner to limit their practice in some way if this is  necessary to protect the public. The undertaking means  the practitioner agrees to do, or to not do, something in  relation to their practice of the profession.  Current undertakings that restrict a practitioner’s  practice of the profession are published on the Register  of practitioners. Current undertakings that relate to  a practitioner’s health are mentioned on the register  but details are not provided. When a National Board  or adjudication body decides the undertakings are  no longer required to ensure safe practice, they are  revoked and are no longer published.  An undertaking is voluntary (but enforceable), whereas  a condition is imposed on a practitioner’s registration.  unprofessional conduct  Conduct that is of a lesser standard than that which  might reasonably be expected of a health practitioner  by the public or the practitioner’s professional peers.  A more extensive definition is available under section 5  of the National Law.  Each profession has a set of standards and guidelines  that clarify the acceptable standard of professional  conduct.  unsatisfactory professional performance  This is when the knowledge, skill or judgement  possessed, or care exercised, by a practitioner in the  practice of the health profession in which they are  registered is below the standard reasonably expected  for a health practitioner with an equivalent level of  training or experience.  voluntary notification  A notification that is not mandatory. The grounds for a  voluntary notification are set out in section 144 of the  National Law.
