Our national network of  licensed facilities including transfer stations,  engineered landfills, liquid treatment plants,  and refineries and depots, allows us to collect,  process, treat, recycle, or safely dispose  of various waste types for over 170,000  customers each year. This capability uniquely  positions us for the reuse, recycling and recovery  of resources while ensuring the safe disposal  of non-recoverable waste. At the heart of our customer-led strategy,  Blueprint 2030, is our goal to be the most  sustainable ‘waste as a resource’ company,  which we are working towards through living  our purpose of making a sustainable future  possible together.  Our strategy aims to provide high-circularity,  low-carbon solutions, seamless customer service,  and value for money, creating superior value for  all our stakeholders. By working together with  our employees, customers, suppliers, regulators  and communities, we are making a sustainable  future possible for the benefit of all. As Australia’s leading waste solutions provider, Cleanaway is  dedicated to contributing to the nation’s transition to a more  sustainable future. Waste, often seen as an everyday by-product,  holds extraordinary potential as a resource to be reused, recovered,  or recycled. However, if not treated and disposed of in a safe and  compliant manner, it can harm people and the environment. Our Blueprint 2030 strategy OVERVIEW 2 Every day we are ‘making a sustainable future possible together’ by recovering resources, protecting  the environment, reducing emissions, and working together with our people, customers, partners  and communities.

FOREWORD FROM CEO One of the best parts of my role is  spending time on-site with the hardworking,  dedicated members of the Cleanaway team.  Every day, across Australia, they  work together to keep each other  safe, serve our customers and deliver  environmental, economic and societal  benefits to our communities.  Cleanaway’s purpose of ‘making a sustainable future possible together’ is more  than words on a wall; it’s a source of genuine pride anchored in our collective  impact. Our team know their actions benefit the environment and communities  they live and work in, as well as their families, friends and future generations. We live our purpose every day. For example, our Container Deposit Scheme  operations, collected more than 208kt of eligible containers in FY24. By  recovering resources in this way, we reduce the need for virgin materials.  Or, in our Liquids Technical Services business, in FY24 we worked for several  government agencies, responsibly treating and disposing of hazardous  household waste, so it didn’t end up being incorrectly disposed of where it could  cause serious environmental harm. During FY24 we refreshed our Sustainability Framework. Our objective was  to focus on where we could effect the greatest material and positive outcomes  for the environment, our people and the communities in which we serve, by: • Recovering resources • Protecting the environment • Reducing emissions, and  • Working together.  6 The following pages bring our framework to life,  and I hope you enjoy reading about our progress.  Our team has delivered several achievements I am  particularly proud of: • Health, Safety and Environment (HSE)  performance: We trained 350 operational leaders  in our HSE leadership program, Stronger Together;  deployed six new Critical Risk standards; advanced  the verification of in-field risk controls; and reduced  fire severity through improved fire detection  and prevention. • Female participation: For the fifth year in a row,  our overall female participation increased. It is now  24.3%, up from 22.8% in FY23.  • Emissions reduction: We reduced our greenhouse  gas emissions (GHG) by 5.4%, and through our  renewable diesel demonstration, proved that we  could run our fleet on the renewable diesel HVO100,  which according to our lifecycle assessment would  generate 91% lower GHG’s than fossil diesel. • Circularity: We partnered with Viva Energy on  an at-scale solution for recycling soft and other  hard-to-treat plastics in Australia.  • Community and education: We delivered the  Recycling Behaviours Report 2024, our fourth annual  report with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation,  which led to a national awareness campaign about  safe disposal of batteries.  We know our stakeholders want to see measurable  outcomes and so in FY25 we will develop additional  goals and targets, so we can measure our progress  more comprehensively and provide greater transparency. We are also preparing for the new Australian Sustainability  Reporting Standards, which we see as an opportunity to  give our investors and stakeholders greater insight into  our work to create a sustainable future for our business,  our customers, our communities and the environment.

As well as foresight and action, we must be accountable,  with strong corporate governance that protects our  stakeholders’ interests through effective oversight, risk  management, and transparency.  The Sustainability Committee is key to that governance.  One of its primary responsibilities is to assess climate-related  risks and opportunities and report these matters directly to  the Board. It reviews key disclosures, including Cleanaway’s  Sustainability Report, climate change disclosures, health,  safety and environmental compliance, and our Modern  Slavery Statement. It also sets targets and defines measures  for sustainability performance. The Sustainability Committee delegates the sustainability  strategy to the Managing Director and Chief Executive  Officer who reviews and oversees its implementation,  ensuring the Board has insight into Cleanaway’s workplace  health and safety, environmental management, quality  management and sustainability – including climate risks  and carbon.  To ensure that strategy, sustainability, and climate-related  matters are linked, the Head of Carbon reports to the  Executive General Manager, Strategy, Mergers and  Acquisitions, and our Head of Investor Relations and  Sustainability reports to the Chief Financial Officer. Finally, our Audit and Risk Committee ensures that  Cleanaway’s sustainability and climate-related risks  are assessed and managed as an integral part of our  Enterprise-wide Risk Management Framework.

By avoiding landfill, it also lowers greenhouse gas emissions  that would otherwise have been generated.  Cleanaway’s resource recovery operations have an important  role to play in enabling Australia’s transition to a circular  economy and we are growing our network to support our  ability to do this. And, through partnerships and innovation we  continue to identify opportunities to develop recycling or reuse  solutions at scale.  By extracting valuable resources  from waste streams, we are  enabling their re-use, while driving  Australia’s circular economy.

Expanding our container recovery network into Victoria  Cleanaway is Australia’s largest collector of polyethylene  terephthalate (PET), high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and  polypropylene (PP) plastics through our involvement in  container deposit schemes in New South Wales, Western  Australia and Queensland. In November 2023, TOMRA Cleanaway commenced as the  West Zone Operator for Victoria’s container deposit scheme,  CDS Vic. With a population of over 2 million, the West Zone  equates to approximately one-third of the State. By recycling used bottles, containers and cans, we prevent  hard plastics and aluminium from becoming litter. CDS Vic  also provides community groups, charities, environmental  organisations, sporting groups and schools with a new way  to raise funds – with the added benefit of keeping their local  community clean. For more information visit the website. Circular economy RECOVERING RESOURCES Cleanaway is helping to close the loop with innovative solutions for recovering resources from the waste stream and  returning them to the supply chain. Our customer and industry partnerships, our strategic assets and technology,  and resource recovery expertise, enable us to deliver these solutions at scale.  One of the first truckloads of collected materials from CDS VIC West Zone via TOMRA Cleanaway. 12 Partnering to deliver sustainable solutions for soft plastics An analysis of Cleanaway’s ‘bag-in-bin’ kerbside collection  trial with Australian councils showed that 85% 1 of collected  household soft and other hard-to-recycle plastics are suitable  for chemical recycling into food-grade plastics. However,  Australia does not have a solution to do this at scale. Cleanaway, in partnership with Viva Energy, wants to  address this issue in what could be a game-changing  move for food-grade recycled packaging. It would reduce  the amount of soft plastics going to landfills and create  a circular path for new products.  In FY24, we initiated a pre-feasibility study of a possible  facility in Victoria. The proposed facility is particularly  exciting because the process would produce an oil, which is  then converted into a plastic resin with chemical properties  identical to virgin products using Viva Energy’s refinery  and polypropylene plant in Geelong, Victoria.  The pre-feasibility assessment will identify a pathway  to commissioning the new facility in 2028. With the  technological solution in place, the feasibility of operations  will depend on a sure supply of feedstock (being the soft  and other hard-to-recycle plastics) and market demand  for the generated recycled plastics. The Commonwealth  Government’s packaging regulation reform and product  stewardship framework, anticipated to be in effect by the  end of 2025, will be critical.

CPA (PET) is a joint venture between Cleanaway, Pact  Group, Asahi Beverages and Coca-Cola Europacific Partners.  Together, we are building a domestic circular plastics supply  chain, where Cleanaway brings its at-scale collections  capabilities and CDS operations to the partnership.  Having already opened a facility in Albury, New South Wales  in FY22, in FY24 the joint venture opened a second CPA PET  facility in Altona North, Victoria, doubling the processing  capacity to 56,000 tonnes of PET. This is the equivalent  of 2 billion 600ml PET bottles each year, or approximately  76 bottles for every Australian. During the year, Circular Plastics Australia (PE), our joint  venture with Pact Group, opened a third facility at Laverton  North, Victoria. This state-of-the-art facility can process over  20,000 tonnes of recycled HDPE and PP – the equivalent of over  half a billion plastic milk bottles and food tubs – every year. The post-consumer material is sorted, shredded, washed,  sanitised and dried before being converted into high-quality  food and non-food-grade resins. The recycled resins  can replace imported virgin resin in the manufacture  of new packaging.

Following the acquisition of Eastern Creek Organics (formerly GRL) in FY23, we began to  transition this site from inserting red bin waste to also processing food, organics and garden organics (FOGO). This transition,  scheduled for completion in FY25, will increase Cleanaway’s capacity at the Western Sydney facility by 35%. Additionally, Cleanaway is commissioning a de-packaging unit at its Kemp’s Creek facility in New South Wales to process  packaged organic material. This unit, set to be operational towards the end of FY25, will serve metropolitan Sydney  and complement the investment in FOGO processing at our nearby Eastern Creek facility. Celebrating five years of serving Brisbane through the Resource Recovery  Innovation Alliance (RRIA)  In 2018, Cleanaway partnered with Brisbane City Council (BCC) to launch the Resource Recovery  Innovation Alliance (RRIA) to manage Brisbane’s waste. FY24 marked the halfway point of this  10-year agreement, during which the alliance has been serving the Brisbane community by:  RRIA Operations Manager Shannon Gorman said: “At the heart of this complex operation are  the people, approximately 100 individuals from the RRIA administration team, resource recovery  operators, drivers and the Brisbane Landfill team. These individuals contribute to providing an  essential service that keeps our city clean, green and healthy.” “I truly believe the next five years will be really exciting and the work rewarding. We’ll be  augmenting the systems we have in place to further divert food organics and garden organics while  continuing to work on recovering resources.”   For more information visit our website. Serving 5.8 million + customers Transporting 2.5 million + tonnes of general waste Diverting 500,000 + tonnes of waste from landfills  via resource recovery operations As we move into FY25, we will focus on the following actions:  • Commission our Western Sydney Materials  Recovery Facility (MRF). • Complete the transition of Eastern Creek  Organics facility to process FOGO. • Finish our pre-feasibility study with Viva Energy  and move into the front end engineering and  design (FEED) phase. • Pilot end-of-life textile collection and recycling,  together with our partners.

Environmental risk management and compliance Cleanaway’s environment policy sets out our  ‘Environment Absolutes’, which detail how we manage  environmental risk and comply with regulation.  In FY23, we began a journey to transform the way  we manage our environmental risks as part of our  broader focus on Health, Safety and Environment (HSE)  strategy. In FY24, we set out a five-year roadmap to  drive improvements in our HSE performance and culture  (refer to Working together pillar). Improving environmental  outcomes is a key focus of the roadmap programs. During FY24 we have continued to transform  how we manage environmental risk at Cleanaway.  Our environmental management system ensures  we consider and mitigate environmental risks in all  aspects of our work. This includes detailed site-specific  environmental risk registers and associated plans and  tools. We also refreshed our Environment Standard  and Guidance and delivered the annual environmental  audit program to assure our activities against regulatory  requirements and our own internal standards.  During FY24 the HSE Critical Risk Program, implementation  of our HSE Culture framework and focused improvement  on Everyday HSE Conversations between leaders and  the frontline workforce are all building blocks to further  develop our branches’ capability and performance  to protect the environment.  In addition to our general duties to protect the  environment, Cleanaway has over 130 of its sites licensed  by environmental regulators. Licensed sites are subject  to site-specific conditions that must also be complied  with and are regularly assured. Like our safety management systems, the environmental  management system is independently certified  to international standard ISO14001.   View our certifications on our website.

Environmental impacts  and compliance PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT Monitoring leachate at Melbourne Regional Landfill, Victoria.  18 Fire risk management Early detection and suppression of fires is critical, especially with more uncontrolled waste,  such as lithium batteries, entering the waste stream in a less controlled way. During FY24, Cleanaway completed the purchase, delivery, and training for 78 Blitzfire Monitors at 40 high-risk sites,  and a further $12 million of risk reduction projects across a further 30 sites. Fire at Erskine Park In early December 2023, a fire was triggered by loader movements in freshly tipped commercial  waste which unknowingly contained flammable liquid.  The loader operator noticed the fire and alerted the  operations team, who implemented the site’s emergency  response procedures and the early warning detection  systems kicked into action:  • Thermal infrared cameras detected elevated  temperatures and alerted the offsite security provider,  who verified the breach using CCTV, and contacted  the fire brigade and branch. • The smoke detection system activated a general  fire alarm, which also notified the fire brigade.  Operations personnel tried unsuccessfully to control  the fire using fire hoses. When that proved unsuccessful,  water cannons were deployed, and the fire was fully  extinguished within four-and-a-half minutes.  The extraction system quickly removed smoke from  the building, allowing responders to take hot and burnt  waste away from the stockpile. The transfer station was reopened less than two-and-  a-half hours after the fire broke out. Fire and Rescue  NSW commended the Cleanaway team on their response  to the fire incident.  Cleanaway’s fire strategy is focused on protecting our  people, assets and the environment:  • Early detection using monitored and alarmed thermal  cameras to enable the site teams to respond quickly.  • Additional fire infrastructure and equipment giving  the site teams the ability to apply early fire suppression.  • Significantly reducing the amount of water  required to control the fire, reducing any potential  environmental impacts. This case study shows the value of having multiple controls  in place. Early detection and response prevented escalation  and reduced the harm, loss and damage. Personnel were  trained in the site’s safety systems and knew the site’s  emergency response plan. All fire controls on-site were  tested and ready in case of fire.

The objective is to identify and proactively manage hazards  that could cause a major accident or incident that could  harm people, the environment, or damage our assets.  In FY24, we adopted the principles of American Petroleum  Institute 754, integrating the four tiers of process safety  incidents into our current incident management system.  This recommended practice identifies leading and  lagging process safety indicators for driving performance  improvement. The indicators are divided into four tiers  representing a leading and lagging continuum. Tier one is  the most lagging, and Tier four is the most leading, focusing  on learning from failures in safety management systems and  operating discipline for the control of hazardous materials  and/or energy.  During the year, we also introduced a Computerised  Maintenance Management System (CMMS) for  planning, executing and recording preventative and  corrective maintenance for fixed assets and equipment  across Cleanaway.  The classification and categorisation of fixed plant assets  in a central location enables Cleanaway to standardise  maintenance practices and to embed and systematise  related learnings across a broad network of sites. Over  the last six months of FY24 we added over 15,000 pieces  of fixed plant and equipment items into the system, and  we expect to add all of our fixed plant and equipment  to the CMMS by the end of FY26.

Danielle joined Cleanaway in early 2022 as part  of our national graduate program, a fast-track  initiative where our graduates rotate through  multiple areas of the business across two years.  With a Bachelor of Science majoring in Ecology  and Conservation Biology in 2018 and a Master  of Environment and Sustainability in 2021 from  Monash University, Danielle was well educated  in environmental protection and sustainability.  She says that “While completing my Master’s  degree, waste management was often touched  on but not explored in detail. I was keen to  learn more and Cleanaway’s Graduate Program,  with its unique blend of education and industry  exposure, provided the perfect opportunity.”  Danielle also reflected on her appreciation of  being able to move around the different areas  of the business, both in operations and support  functions. This helped to strengthen her  professional confidence and build relationships  with a diverse range of managers whom  she now considers mentors.  The Program provided Danielle with a broad  understanding of our operations but also the  opportunity to build a strong network across  the business. Danielle excelled and secured  a full-time position as an Environment Business  Partner in Victoria.  In her current role, Danielle helps to protect  the environment and ensure compliance across  our Victorian sites.”Our team provides specialist  environmental support to our sites to minimise  the environmental risks of the waste we  receive and manage for our customers. As my  responsibilities increase, I hope to drive further  environmental improvements on sites and look  forward to supporting our operational teams in  a greater capacity.”  Danielle’s advice to those entering the workforce  is to be proactive in their learning and growth.  She encourages them to seek opportunities to  get involved in areas that interest them, even  if it’s outside their immediate responsibilities,  and to connect with experienced colleagues  for guidance and mentorship. Cleanaway employee, Danielle. 20 Decommissioning hand sanitiser  During the global COVID-19 pandemic, hand sanitiser was deemed indispensable, leading to  a rush to produce and stockpile vast amounts that far exceeded what could be used before expiry.  Now, in the wake of the pandemic, these stockpiles of hand sanitiser must be treated and disposed  of to minimise the risk of environmental harm.  In FY24, Cleanaway’s Liquid Technical Services (LTS) business completed a number of major sanitiser treatment and  disposal contracts, in which it collected, consolidated and treated 515 tonnes of expired hand sanitiser, reducing its  impact on our environment.  In addition, packaging waste generated in this process was diverted from landfill and recycled, helping to close the loop  on plastic waste. Cardboard was repurposed within our internal solid waste operations. Pallets were inspected and those  in suitable condition were reused, while damaged pallets were chipped and turned into landscaping materials.  Remediation of landfill site in Clayton completed  In 2024 Cleanaway proudly handed over its fully remediated 30-hectare landfill site at Victory Road in Clayton,  Victoria, for the City of Kingston community to enjoy.  Around 450,000 square metres of engineered  geosynthetics and 180,000 cubic metres of soil were  used to safely cover the landfill. The site was topped with  300,000 square metres of grass and the team planted  230,000 shrubs and trees, using seeds native to the area. Three kilometres of paths, a fitness circuit, fenced dog  park, and viewing platform were all constructed for the  community. The site connects to the City of Kingston’s  broader ‘Chain of Parks’.  This five-year transformation revitalised the site into a  parkland that is functional and sustainable to best practice  engineering, design and environmental standards. Part  of one of the largest landfill remediations of its kind in  Australia, conducted across several Clayton locations, it  owes its success to careful selection of supplier partners,  high-grade materials and strict regulatory compliance.  In line with Cleanaway’s carbon reduction targets,  the site safely captures methane gas and uses it to  generate electricity for the community.  Cleanaway worked closely with the City of Kingston,  the Environmental Protection Authority Victoria, and the  south-east Melbourne urban community nature program,  Living Links. The result is a green space that creates and  protects value for heritage and landscape conservation,  biodiversity, waterway health, recreation, agriculture  and horticulture.  The work doesn’t stop there. Cleanaway will carefully  monitor the site for the next three decades to ensure  environmental safety and ongoing best practice on  landfill transformation.

Community impact  management However, sometimes noise, smell, busy roads, fires and traffic accidents can affect communities.  We need to be proactive in managing the risks of these impacts on communities, because without  their trust and social licence, we cannot operate effectively, let alone innovate and grow. To ensure that government, regulators, residents and businesses are informed about our facilities  and operations, we follow this community engagement approach. Education Experience shows that  explaining a facility  or project’s beneficial  role in the context of  waste management,  resource recovery, and  environmental impact  can improve community  sentiment and willingness  to engage with us.  ‘Design out’ impacts We work with independent  experts to identify the  impacts our operations may  have on the community or  environment, and design  solutions to mitigate  these impacts. This  gives our stakeholders  confidence that we’re  operating to the highest  environmental standards. Economic  contribution For work that has the  potential to have a  material economic impact,  Cleanaway considers how  we can procure supplies  and resources locally.  Often, we also run a  community benefit fund  to provide community  groups and environmental  projects with a financial  boost through our work.  Increasing the community’s  understanding of how our  projects contribute to the  local economy through job  creation and by purchasing  from local suppliers can  also help communities  accept our work.  PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT Communication  and feedback Our stakeholders can  teach us a lot about our  sites and help us to ensure  we’re designing waste  management solutions that  have the best outcomes  for our customers and  the community. We build  and maintain strong  relationships with our  varied stakeholder groups  to provide transparent,  timely information about  current activities and  future plans while giving  them opportunities to ask  questions or voice concerns. 22 Community Benefit Fund in New Chum, Ipswich, Queensland In FY24, the New Chum Community Benefit Fund distributed $50,000 to a wide range of  welfare programs, sporting clubs, youth support and community connectivity initiatives  in the Ipswich community. With the support of the New Chum  Community Reference Group, which meets  monthly on-site to exchange information,  issues and ideas, Cleanaway selected nine  projects from 18 submissions by local  community groups. Cleanaway’s Queensland General Manager  (Solid Waste Services) Aaron Carter said, “This  program is incredibly important to Cleanaway. We operate in the City of Ipswich and many of  our team members reside locally. We want to  impact the local community positively, and this is  an exceptional avenue and opportunity to do so.” Each year, Cleanaway operates a number of  Community Benefit Funds to support the  communities in which we operate.

These targets are aligned with the most conservative  1.5°C scenarios in the Sixth Assessment Report of the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and  are consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C above  pre‑industrial levels by 2100. The methane targets are also  aligned with the Global Methane Pledge. We track our  performance against these targets on a net emissions basis.  We advocate for the government to champion sustainable  practices, foster innovation, and implement policies that  benefit both the planet and Australia’s economy.

These emissions can be reduced  through improved gas capture and converting captured  methane into lower carbon intensity energy such as  renewable electricity. For example, at the Melbourne Regional Landfill,  Cleanaway’s largest landfill, methane is captured and  converted into electricity to power, on average, the  equivalent of more than 11,700 homes in Victoria. We are also exploring ways to reduce carbon dioxide  emissions from our fleet and electricity use. For our fleet,  we could substitute low carbon fuels such as renewable  diesel for fossil fuel diesel. Fleet decarbonisation  is important, as emissions from fleet constitutes  approximately 20% of our total Scope 1 and 2 emissions.  To reduce our carbon footprint from electricity use, we  can increase the consumption of renewable electricity.  Landfill gas capture We are prioritising greenhouse gas emission reductions that  are both readily addressable and material to our footprint.  For Cleanaway, that means initially focusing on reducing  methane emissions from our landfills through improved  landfill gas capture. In FY24, we continued to reduce our  methane emissions, and we remain aligned to our 1.5°C  aligned targets on a net combined greenhouse gas basis. In FY24, we improved the efficiency of landfill gas capture  by 12.5% across our portfolio of landfills, substantially  reducing methane emissions. We achieved this through gas  capture improvements at MRL and New Chum landfills.

In FY23, we committed to a hydrogen truck trial  with the aim of understanding how hydrogen  fuel vehicles perform relative to their fossil diesel  counterparts and to better understand the  technology in practice.  Throughout FY24, we continued to assess  the viability of moving to an electric and/or  hydrogen‑powered fleet however, disappointingly  the hydrogen trial was set back, with the  hydrogen truck manufacturer announcing  it had entered administration.  Despite this setback, we continued to explore  alternative fuel sources and successfully  demonstrated the use of renewable diesel with  an on‑road demonstration in Melbourne, Victoria.

We’re committed to leading our industry with innovative,  fit‑for‑purpose solutions that align with our customers’  goals while working towards Federal emissions targets. A large proportion of our heavy vehicle fleet which use  fossil diesel, are over half‑way through their 10‑plus‑year  life span. A great solution – a sustainable one – is to reduce  the emissions of these vehicles while they are being used  as they serve out their useful lives. HVO100 can be part of that solution.  As a one for one replacement for diesel, HVO100 is a  hydrotreated vegetable oil that can power our trucks.  Critically, it’s nearly identical to fossil diesel, which means  it can be dropped in with no new infrastructure, fleet,  or additional capital required. Unlike fossil diesel, though,  our lifecycle assessment showed that HVO100 produced  91% lower greenhouse gas emissions. 1 In addition, our HVO100 supplier, Neste, is committed  to traceability and sustainability, underpinned by  their rigorous Supplier Code of Conduct and Neste  Responsible Sourcing Principle.    You can find more information about Neste’s  sustainability policies here.   View video for more information. In February 2024, we started using HVO100 in two heavy  collection vehicles, each pulling a 7‑9 tonne payload over  a 12‑plus‑hour day as they served two Melbourne‑based  customers. Over the five months of the demonstration,  HVO100 equalled fossil diesel in fuel consumption, uptime  and performance. When burned, HVO100 releases into the  atmosphere biogenic CO2 – which is a part of the natural  atmospheric carbon cycle. This results in an avoidance  of 72 tonnes of non‑biogenic Scope 1 carbon dioxide  emissions (which introduces new CO2 into the atmospheric  carbon cycle) that would result when fossil fuel‑based diesel  is burned. Our demonstration showcased that with supportive  government policy, HVO100 is a proven option for  decarbonising Australia’s heavy vehicle industry. In addition  to testing HV0100’s viability for our own fleet, it produced  important data and real‑world experience for the roll‑out of  a low‑carbon liquid fuels industry in Australia. The use of HVO100 in Cleanaway  trucks is part of our Blueprint  2030 strategy to reduce the  carbon impact of our operations  and increase circularity from  the material we collect.” Mark Schubert, CEO and Managing Director, Cleanaway 1   HVO100 renewable diesel demonstration Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).

As a key provider of Australia’s waste solutions, we  handle the nation’s discarded materials, giving us unique  insights into the positive impact government policy and  initiatives can have in driving a sustainable future, for  the benefit of all Australians.  This year, we have collaborated with governments at  all levels on key policies that directly impact waste and  resource recovery. Particularly, we provided expert advice  and guidance to policymakers and regulators in support  of the Federal Government’s climate ambition of net zero  emissions by 2050.  Cleanaway’s Head of Carbon and Circularity is a member  of the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the  Environment and Water (DCCEEW) Landfill Gas Technical  Working Group (TWG). The TWG was established to  provide robust science‑based advice to DCCEEW on  landfill gas capture calculations. Following the consultation  Cleanaway made a formal submission to DCCEEW.  In FY24, we continued the work we began with DCCEEW  in FY23 to enhance landfill gas reporting in Australia.  Together, we are working to improve existing methods  to develop a robust, science‑based approach for accurately  capturing landfill emissions. We remain committed to ensuring our reporting aligns  with relevant Emissions and Energy Reporting Systems,  such as ACCUs, Safeguard, and National Greenhouse  and Energy Reporting (NGER). It’s how we play an active  role in helping Australia to meet its greenhouse gas  emission targets with credibility. We have also worked closely with DCCEEW’s Fuel  Standards Branch to provide expert advice on the use  of renewable diesel in our fleet. This has included input  in establishing a paraffinic diesel standard. We also  provided submissions to the Australian Government’s  Transport Net Zero Roadmap and Low Carbon Liquid Fuels. At a State Government level we provided formal  submissions on Western Australia’s Heavy Duty Vehicle  Decarbonisation and the NSW Renewable Fuel Scheme.

And, we also can’t  keep filling up landfills with waste that can be  more efficiently treated and disposed of with  a lower environmental impact.  Energy from Waste (EfW) provides a solution to  this need and will play a critical role in Australia’s  waste infrastructure. As the nation’s largest waste  management company, we are uniquely positioned to  be a part of Australia’s EfW future. Bringing an EfW plant online takes years. This is an  opportunity for Cleanaway: as economic conditions for EfW  continue to improve, Cleanaway is progressing the long lead‑ time activities required for commissioning an EfW plant.  In FY24, we advanced our planning approval for two  significant EfW projects, one in Victoria and one in  Queensland. The development of these projects is  closely aligned to State Government policy targets of  achieving 80% diversion from landfill by 2030, demand  from local government and supportive market conditions  driven by an increase in landfill taxes.   View video about energy from waste. Regulatory responsiveness Cleanaway has an important role in guiding policy makers and actively supporting councils and industries to address  constraints in current systems of production, consumption, recovery and reuse. We engage with stakeholders about  the laws and regulations that affect these industries and our business operations across the nation. We are part of  industry associations that advocate for policies that actively advance the circular economy in Australia. This includes the following industry networks and associations: Waste Management  and Resource Recovery  Association Australia (WMRR) Who represent landfill,  recycling and resource recovery,  Energy from Waste, e‑waste,  organics, construction and  demolition, commercial and  industrial, hazardous and  biohazardous waste sectors. National Waste and  Recycling Industry  Council (NWRIC) Who represent national waste  management companies and  State‑based affiliates, who  represent the interests of the  more than 500 small waste  management businesses.

We also undertook a deep dive into our physical climate risks – the risks associated with extreme weather and other  climate‑related hazards. This suggested that, while most Cleanaway sites will not be highly impacted, sites exposed  to increasingly intense rainfall and extreme heat need further assessment. This will be completed in FY25. The assessment from FY24 highlighted the  following sources of risk: • contraction in carbon‑intensive industries and reduced  service demand from affected sectors because of the  decarbonisation of the economy • the introduction of an explicit or implied carbon price • an increase in the frequency and severity  of extreme weather events. Equally, transition to net zero brings  various opportunities: • increased regulation favouring the domestic recycling  industry to reduce embodied carbon emissions; for  example, container deposit schemes, government  investments into recycling infrastructure • emergence of new waste streams and growth  in low‑carbon customer solutions for existing  waste streams • using the inherent energy content of waste  and incentives to invest in Energy from Waste plants. As we move into FY25, we will focus on the following actions: • Continue investments into landfill capping  and gas capture to deliver further methane  emission reductions.  • Explore opportunities for increased use of  renewable diesel to reduce fleet emissions  (subject to supportive policy).  • Progressing the long-lead times activities  required to originate EfW solutions of renewable  energy to reduce emissions from electricity use. • Expand carbon offerings to customers to lower  our customers’ waste-related Scope 3 emissions.  • Analyse our upstream and downstream Scope  3 emissions to identify emissions hotspots in  our supply chain.

Strong HSE performance is vital to Cleanaway’s operations  and future growth, and instils confidence in our customers,  communities and shareholders. During FY24, we set out a five‑year strategy and roadmap to drive improvements in our HSE performance and culture.  Cleanaway’s operations are varied and complex, as such the strategy is multifaceted with a focus on risk prevention,  capability build, and cultural transformation. The roadmap outlines how everyone at Cleanaway will work to keep each  other, the environment, and our communities, safe.  WORKING TOGETHER Introducing a new safety measure  Historically, Cleanaway has used the traditional safety lag indicator Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) as the  primary measure of safety performance. Cleanaway’s TRIFR has decreased over the past decade down from 12.6 in 2014,  levelling off over the past five years to the 2024 result of 4.6. Industry benchmarking shows that Cleanaway’s safety  performance (as measured by TRIFR) continues to be highly competitive ‘if not industry leading’ across multiple industries  including waste, fleet and logistics.  Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate [TRIFR] 1 1   TRIFR is measured per million hours worked and includes both employee incidents and hours worked, and contractor incidents and hours  provided to Cleanaway. FY14 FY15 FY16 FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23 FY24 12.6 10.6 10.8 7.6 6.2 5.7 4.5 3.6 4.2 3.7 4.6 36 In FY24, we continued to focus our efforts on proactive and  adaptive strategies for preventing accidents and eliminate  serious injuries and life‑altering events. In support of this focus,  we introduced the severity metric Serious Injuries Frequency rate  (SIF) to our measurement framework, as we have seen other  leading HSE committed companies do.  The metric is based on the observation that ‘the things  that kill you are different from the things that will hurt you’  (Todd Conklin, expert in Organisation Culture and Human  Performance) and is defined by the legislation as an injury  that requires the person to have immediate treatment as an  inpatient in a hospital or immediate treatment for several  injury types.  Analysis of serious injuries at Cleanaway demonstrates  year‑on‑year improvements in the number and frequency  of serious injuries for the past four years, down from  1.37 in FY21 to 0.49 in FY24.  The increased focus on serious injuries emphasises the  importance of understanding our critical risks, verifying the  health of critical controls and learning from incidents. This  informs how we prioritise our preventative programs.

To support our cultural journey, in October 2023  we introduced our HSE Culture across Cleanaway.  This framework provides a common language and positive  behaviours that describe ‘how’ we keep each other  and the environment safe at Cleanaway.  A proven industry framework adopted from Safer  Together Ltd, our HSE Culture is supporting our efforts  to lower incident rates, build trust, increase engagement,  and improve how we learn. The supporting behaviours  were developed by our own workforce taking into  consideration the work we do, past incidents, and lessons  learned from industry.  Culture is all about the signals we send, so the focus during  FY24 has been on embedding the framework into branch  normal ways of working such as site inductions, pre‑start  discussions, visual management boards, toolbox meetings,  HSE investigations, and team recognition which will  continue into FY25. Embedding a strong HSE culture will  take time; we see it as a crucial part of driving sustainable  improvements in our HSE performance.   WORKING TOGETHER Our HSE Culture Framework Our HSE Culture is a common framework that links us all and describes how we keep each other,  our communities and the environment safe at Cleanaway. Dandenong Victoria Hydrocarbons team being educated on our HSE Culture framework. 38 Stronger Together HSE Leaders Program Cultural change starts from the top, and as an  investment in our leaders across Cleanaway,  during 2023–24 we developed and deployed  Cleanaway’s first-ever HSE Leaders program  called Stronger Together.  The conditions and hazards our Cleanaway  teams face can change daily, highlighting the  dynamic nature of our work and the need for  adaptable and tailored HSE programs. The  Stronger Together Program is designed  specifically for our working environment.  Throughout FY24, we completed phase  one of the Program which comprised 170  interactive face-to-face sessions with 350  leaders including the Business Unit Leaders,  Branch Managers and HSE and HR personnel.  Phase 2 will see the Program extended to  all frontline supervisors commencing in  September 2024.  The Program draws on the latest research  and techniques to bring out the best in our  people and systems. The Program has five  modules focused on HSE Leadership and  Culture, Risk Management, Everyday HSE  Conversations, Human and Organisational  Principles, and Learning and Improvement.  The Program has reinforced the importance  of collaboration and collective responsibility  among our leaders in creating a safety  culture where every individual plays a role  in protecting themselves, their team mates,  and the environment. Good HSE performance is good  business – our people are  safe, we’re not harming the  environment, we’re in control,  and we get to spend more of our  time and energy on running and  improving the business and less  energy responding to incidents.”  Deborah Peach, EGM HSE, Fleet & Asset Integrity Stronger Together Leaders Program in action.

This program forms part of our ongoing efforts to simplify and improve our approach to risk  management at Cleanaway.  Critical risks are the high consequence events that could  result in serious injury or impact to our people, the  environment, or our assets. The Program is focused on  raising awareness and understanding of the causes of  critical risk events, the preventative and mitigative controls,  and establishing ongoing monitoring and assurance to  prevent potential incidents.  The Critical Risk Program encompasses:  • Simplified Standards and guidance that clarify minimum  mandatory requirements.  • Visual risk bowties for each event that detail the event,  preventative and mitigative controls and consequences  that assist the frontline teams in better understanding  and managing the risk.  • Simple first line of defence field assessments for  each risk to support the site teams in verifying the  effectiveness of controls. To date there have been  more than 1,000 Field Assessments completed for the  critical risks.  • Additional second line of defence assurance processes  to further validate the effectiveness of controls.  Throughout FY24 there were six critical risks released  including Mobile Plant and People Interaction, Driving  (including Chain of Responsibility), Waste Acceptance,  Fire Management, High Pressure Water Jetting and Falls  from Height. This program will continue into FY25.

Our workforce is made up  of individuals from diverse backgrounds, cultures and experiences,  enriching our organisation and creating value for our customers and  key partners. Our diversity is a strength which we embrace, as it is  integral to our sustainability efforts, providing circular and low-carbon  solutions for future generations. This means that Cleanaway must be  an organisation where people feel they belong and take pride in the  essential work we do for local communities.  Building a safe and inclusive culture  In August 2023 we introduced our Respect@Cleanaway Program to build a safe, inclusive and respectful culture at  Cleanaway and comply with our positive duty obligations. The Program draws a clear line against abuse, harassment,  discrimination and disrespectful conduct. In 2024, 96% of our people completed the Respect@Cleanaway online training program, and 75% of our leaders completed  the Respect@Cleanaway facilitated leader program. Leaders play a critical role in fostering a safe, respectful and inclusive culture and building inclusive leadership capability will  be a key focus in FY25. The data collected through our employee listening strategy and cultural deep dives will also be used  to facilitate improved psychological safety and cultivate a sense of belonging.  As the next step in our cultural journey we launched our Guiding Principles in June 2024. These are the core pillars of  our culture which foster growth, innovation and inclusivity, and encourage safety, internal collaboration, and proactive,  customer‑focused approaches.

That means  significantly increased representation of women in operational and management roles and gender parity across the  organisation; for example, more women in traditionally male‑dominated areas, such as driving, and more men in traditionally  female‑dominated areas, such as customer service. An important part of fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace at Cleanaway is increasing female participation across  the workforce, and in FY24 we continued to focus on this across the Cleanaway Group. In pursuit of achieving our targets,  female participation is measured monthly at all levels of the business. In FY22, we challenged ourselves to achieve at least 40% women in the executive team (defined as CEO‑1) by 2027.  This target has been raised to challenge ourselves further to include at least 40% of women in leadership roles (defined  as CEO‑2) by 2030. We have met our FY27 commitment to achieve 40% female Executive team participation (CEO‑1) three  years before projected, and are close to our 2030 commitment for females in leadership roles (CEO‑2) of 39.3%. Further,  at an operational level, female participation increased from 10.0% in FY23 to 11.9% in FY24. Understanding our workforce  In March 2024, we ran our Employee Engagement  Survey. 7,533 participants were invited to participate,  and pleasingly our participation rate was 65%.  Our overall engagement score was 62%. Support to  work flexibly, our alignment to sustainability, and feeling  like part of a team came through as highlights for  our employees.  Over the coming 12 months we will look to embed our  new Guiding Principles with a focus on collaboration  and connection between our teams, an area highlighted  for improvement. Our survey also enabled us to capture a demographic  profile of our people which informs our ongoing diversity  and inclusion strategy.

After demonstrating an exceptional dedication and skillset  in this role, Jess wanted to expand her experience and learn  additional roles within her branch as a means of finding  further ways to assist her site teams.  Recognising her potential and ambition, Jess transitioned  into our driving academy. “The thing I loved most about  the academy was the diverse range of backgrounds  displayed by the cohort. Despite everyone coming from  different backgrounds with different skillsets, we were all  able to achieve the same outcomes due to the immense  support we received from the driver trainers.”  Jess’ enthusiasm and commitment have been instrumental  to her success, and we are excited to witness her journey  as she takes on new challenges. Her story serves as an  inspiration for our teams and reinforces our belief in the  power of internal mobility to drive employee satisfaction  and retention. Gender pay gap  Cleanaway is committed to equal pay for equal work  regardless of a person’s gender, culture, ethnicity, or any  other personal attributes.  We proactively monitor and review our policies and  practices and address variations when they arise to  minimise gender pay disparity. For more information,  view the Cleanaway ESG Databook. In February 2024, Cleanaway released our Gender Pay Gap  Report 2023 which details the median Gender Pay Gap  for the WGEA 2022 to 2023 reporting year. Cleanaway’s  median base salary gender pay gap was 3.2% and median  total remuneration gender pay gap was 24.3%.   View Cleanaway’s WGEA response.

Secondary carers can take two weeks of leave at full pay. Employees are eligible  from their first day with Cleanaway. Our policy also gives employees who experience miscarriage or stillbirth paid leave  as well as additional support.  This policy came into effect on 1 July 2023 and was utilised by 44 employees during the year.  Refer to the ESG Databook for further information. Cleanaway’s new paid parental leave policy For many working parents, the joys and challenges of a new child can feel like a constant balancing act between work  responsibilities and the immense needs and precious moments of a new life. Simon Pearce shares his experience of  welcoming his second child, supported by Cleanaway’s new paid parental scheme.  In April 2023 Simon welcomed his beautiful little boy into his family, joining his active three‑year‑old brother.  Just as excited by their new baby as they were for his firstborn, this time was different.  With Simon’s first child, unpaid leave put a financial strain on the family, so Simon took less time off giving him little  time to bond with his new baby. With his second child, he could take more extended leave without the financial worry.  Simon’s Manager Ezra, shares with us that “While it’s never easy to lose a crucial member of your team for an extended  period, it’s so important that our team members feel fully supported to embrace the important aspects of life, like family.” Simon urges new parents to take full advantage of the scheme, noting the societal reluctance and invisible barriers that  some new dads experience when taking parental leave. “Push through these barriers if you do encounter them. It’s worth  it for you, it’s worth it for your children, and it’s worth it for your partner. It’s a special time you will never get again,  so make the most of it with your newborn.”  This time is so special to me for  two key reasons – the chance  to bond with my son at a level  that just isn’t possible with the  quantity of awake time available  when working fulltime. Secondly,  it sets the standard for a more  balanced parental load between  my wife and me. I am a more  capable parent and take on a large  share of parenting responsibilities  as a direct result of this leave.” Simon, Cleanaway WORKING TOGETHER Cleanaway employee Simon, with his son. 44 Reconciliation A sustainable future is possible only in partnership with First Nations people. Since launching  our first Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) in 2016, we have advanced inclusion for First Nations  people in our organisation and in the communities in which we operate.  We took an important step forward in March 2024 with  the launch of a new RAP, led by our RAP Working Group,  co‑chaired by two of Cleanaway’s executive team members.  The new RAP provides a pathway for Cleanaway to  continue exploring, building, and increasing our business’  cultural competency and delivering meaningful actions  that support reconciliation.  We understand that education around reconciliation never  stops, so we need to continue to work across our business  to ensure that our workforce collectively benefits from  cultural learning and appreciation.  Additionally, we have a renewed focus on improving  employment outcomes for our First Nations workforce  by increasing recruitment, retention and professional  development opportunities. This is supported by the  development of Cleanaway’s Aboriginal Employment  Strategy which details our commitments under three  key focus areas: • Attracting and recruiting an Aboriginal workforce • Creating meaningful and sustainable pathways for  our Aboriginal workforce • Facilitating an inclusive and respectful culture In FY25, this strategy will focus on the review of our  recruitment practices to ensure they are culturally safe,  ensuring our Talent Acquisition team complete cultural  awareness training, and reviewing and analysing  our workforce composition data to understand the  composition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  employees at all levels of the organisation. Our artwork  This artwork represents Cleanaway’s commitment to fostering a sustainable circular economy  and symbolises Cleanaway’s deep respect for the land, oceans and waterways of Australia.  The three central circular clusters represent the three pillars  of reconciliation: Relationships, Respect and Opportunities.  These three pillars provide the backbone and support for  Cleanaway’s ongoing reconciliation journey.  Organic shapes depicting nature and foliage are  interspersed between the three circular shapes symbolising  sustainability and the revitalisation of the land on which  Cleanaway operates. The surrounding circular shapes represent Cleanaway’s  focus on building genuine relationships with Aboriginal and  Torres Strait Islander communities.

Excludes Directors, Owner  Drivers, Contractors and Consultants.  Determined based on headcount. In FY24, through bringing our talent acquisition function back ‘in‑house’ and supporting new starters in the first 12  months of their employment with a range of new initiatives such as mentoring and proactive ‘stay conversations’, vacancies  have stabilised below their historical average. First year turnover also improved over the period and is on track to reach  management’s internal target of 30% during FY25.  Alongside our efforts to build a culture of respect, ownership and connection, which plays an important role in attracting  employees, our focus on apprenticeships and traineeships has been instrumental in reducing vacancies at Cleanaway.  We see these programs as a key component to upskilling our workforce and building a pipeline of candidates for roles  which have traditionally been hard to fill. This has been reflected in our attraction strategy becoming a strategic process,  one that supports a range of people with a range of skills and experience into our business. In FY24, we broadened  our apprenticeship and traineeship program to include Certificate III in Driving Operations and Certificate III in Waste  Management to our suite of training opportunities which attracts, retains and supports the upskilling of individuals.  This has seen our numbers of apprenticeships and traineeships increase by more than 50% across the year. Cleanaway’s voluntary turnover finished the period at 17.6%,  down from 21.5% as at the end of FY23, and back in line with  pre-COVID-19 levels. In FY24, stabilising the workforce was a key  focus area for management following the impact of the tight  labour market conditions in FY22 and FY23.

For two financial years,  bargaining was deferred because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which  led to a number of industrial consequences. We have now prioritised  efforts to complete negotiations on our existing EAs.  Cleanaway was involved in two workplace determination matters in the Fair Work Commission, which resulted in the  Commission determining (under new legislation introduced in 2024) the final clauses of an agreement that could not be  agreed through extensive bargaining. The determination was a balanced outcome that helped settle several outstanding  matters and will assist bargaining efforts in the future.  At the beginning of FY24, 58 EAs had passed their nominal expiry date and needed to be replaced. At the end of the  financial year we reduced this number to 22. All are now being negotiated and we intend to finalise them in the first half of  the 2025 financial year.  For the first time in several years, we have commenced negotiations before the nominal expiry date of agreements as we  seek to engage with our people proactively. We continue to consolidate EAs and simplify terms where possible to ensure  a continuously improved, streamlined, market‑competitive approach.  Cleanaway Daniels employees at Dandenong Victoria site.

Across our business, our people are passionate  about helping to promote environmental sustainability.  Community engagement  Education remains a crucial way we drive engagement  and provide value to communities, delivered in  conjunction with our council contracts, schools and  within businesses.  Our education programs aim to drive confidence  in the recycling system, promote and encourage  the right recycling practices, educate on how we  maximise diversion from landfill and promote a greater  understanding of the circular economy.  Our in‑house team of educators deliver sessions across  the country and we continue to look for innovative  ways to deliver information, such as with a trial of AI  technology with our Moreton Bay Council and use of  localised social media campaigns.  On top of education, our sites play an active role  in communities they are a part of via community  sponsorships and donations, strategic social  procurement and meaningful partnerships.      Visit the Cleanaway website for more information. Clean Up Australia  We were excited to continue our ninth year of partnership  with Clean Up Australia this year. Together, our two  organisations work towards the common goal to make a  sustainable future possible. Clean Up Australia continues  to mobilise everyday Australians to take action to improve  recycling and make sustainable choices in their everyday  lives and Cleanaway through our resource recovery enables  these actions to make a real difference, making for a  meaningful and enduring partnership.  This year we celebrated our biggest Clean Up Australia  Day activation, where we proudly ran 35 clean up events  across Australia organised by volunteers from all parts of  the Cleanaway business. It was rewarding to partner with  our team members and customers, rolling up our sleeves  to remove litter from cities, rivers, beaches and bushlands  across Australia.  Our partnership extends beyond a single day as we  work together to mobilise Australians to conserve our  environment, and educate on important issues such as safe  battery disposal, reducing single‑use plastic and promoting  a circular economy.

Representative  of the Australian population, our research provides invaluable insights into  the attitudes, behaviours and challenges faced by Australians about recycling.  These insights then inform where our education efforts are focused.  This year our research questions delved deeper into battery and rechargeable  device disposal, an issue that has been topical across the waste industry as  battery fires in trucks and facilities continue to put lives and communities at risk.  Our research revealed 52% of respondents think recycling batteries is difficult,  and 23% don’t know batteries and rechargeable devices cannot be placed in  kerbside bins. Concerningly, our research also demonstrated that a third of people  don’t realise disposing of batteries in kerbside bins can cause fires in collection  vehicles and waste facilities. Following these results, we developed a national PR campaign with input from  the Battery Stewardship Council to drive awareness of the issue of incorrectly  disposing of batteries and the risk of fire this causes; and educate on how to  safely dispose of batteries. We also created a new module on our Greenius  education platform available for use by customers, schools and the general public.  Read our Recycling Behaviours Report.

This responsibility includes establishing and maintaining  internal controls, maintaining adequate records and making  estimates that are relevant to the preparation of the subject  matter, such that it is free from material misstatement,  whether due to fraud or error. EY’s responsibility and independence For the limited assurance engagement, our responsibility is  to express a conclusion on the Limited Assurance Subject  Matter based on the evidence we have obtained. For the  reasonable assurance engagement, our responsibility is to  express an opinion on the Reasonable Assurance Subject  Matter based on the evidence we have obtained. We have complied with the independence and relevant  ethical requirements, which are founded on fundamental  principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence  and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.  EY applies Auditing Standard ASQM 1 Quality Management  for Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Reports  and Other Financial Information or Other Assurance or  Related Services Engagements, which requires the firm  to design, implement and operate a system of quality  management including policies or procedures regarding  compliance with ethical requirements, professional  standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Our approach to conducting the  assurance procedures We conducted our assurance procedures in accordance  with the Australian Standard for Assurance Engagements  (ASAE 3000): Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or  Reviews of Historical Financial Information and (ASAE 3410):  Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements  and the terms of reference for this engagement as agreed  with Cleanaway on 19 April 2024.  For the limited assurance engagement, these standards  require that we plan and perform our engagement to express  a conclusion on whether anything has come to our attention  that causes us to believe that the Limited Assurance Subject  Matter is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance  with the Criteria, and to issue a report. For the reasonable assurance engagement, these standards  require that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain  reasonable assurance about whether, in all material respects,  the Reasonable Assurance Subject Matter is presented in  accordance with the Criteria, and to issue a report. The nature, timing and extent of the assurance procedures  selected depend on our judgement, including an assessment  of the risk of material misstatement, whether due to fraud  or error. Description of assurance procedures performed A limited assurance engagement consists of making  enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for preparing the  Limited Assurance Subject Matter and related information,  and applying analytical and other appropriate procedures.  The Limited Assurance procedures we performed were  based on our professional judgement and included, but  were not limited to: • Conducted interviews with personnel to understand the  business and reporting process • Conducted interviews with key personnel including data  owners and data providers, to understand Cleanaway’s  process for collecting, collating, and reporting the  Selected Disclosures during the reporting period  • Assessed the suitability of the Criteria and that the  calculation criteria have been correctly applied in  accordance with the methodologies outlined in  the Criteria  • Undertook analytical review procedures to support the  reasonableness of the data •  Identified and tested assumptions supporting calculations • Tested, on a sample basis, underlying source information  to assess the accuracy of the data • Assessed the adequacy and appropriateness of the  presentation relating to the Selected Disclosures, and  whether the disclosed information is consistent with  our understanding of management and performance  at Cleanaway. We believe that the evidence obtained is sufficient  and appropriate to provide a basis for our limited  assurance conclusion.

Consequently,  the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance  engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that  would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance  engagement been performed. Our procedures were  designed to obtain a limited level of assurance on which  to base our conclusion and do not provide all the evidence  that would be required to provide a reasonable level  of assurance. Our procedures did not include testing controls or  performing procedures relating to checking aggregation  or calculation of data within IT systems.

We are delivering  on our customer proposition of service, value for money, and sustainable  customer solutions through embedding our operational excellence  blueprints throughout the business. These allow us to work smarter   and make our business more prosperous.     With our people at the heart of our success, we are creating a working  environment where everyone feels safe, included, and respected.   We continue to improve diversity, particularly female participation,   and we’ve made significant progress towards our 40:40 gender   balance vision. Together with our commitment to uphold the highest environmental  standards, keeping our people and the communities that we operate   in safe is foundational at Cleanaway. In FY23, we focused on enhancing  our risk management and developing a safety-oriented mindset. While  we’ve seen pleasing improvement this year with significantly fewer  direction notices and a 12% lower TRIFR, we aspire for industry-leading  HSE performance and there’s more work to be done. In support of that,  we developed a refreshed HSE strategy and detailed five-year plan, which  executed well, will result in us achieving our aspiration.   Our Blueprint 2030 strategy positions Cleanaway to capture opportunities  that will emerge from society’s transition towards greater landfill  diversion and a more circular economy. We are making strong progress  by partnering to broaden capability and expand our footprint. Our  partnerships, such as Circular Plastics Australia (CPA) and TOMRA  Cleanaway, together with our GRL, Hydrocarbons, and Australian Eco   Oils businesses, are helping us prosper from a domestic circular economy.  Last year, we established 2030 and 2050 greenhouse gas reduction  targets for methane and carbon dioxide. Our initial focus is on reducing  methane emissions from our landfills, which represent about 74% of our  total emissions. I am pleased to report that at the end of FY23, we were  tracking well ahead of our target trajectory. We achieved this by investing  in landfill gas infrastructure including drilling more than 250 gas wells,  which resulted in a 15% increase in landfill gas captured. Having delivered  on our environmental objective, we captured the available financial  reward to deliver a return on our investment to shareholders.     We continue to explore new technologies and energy initiatives to deliver  high-circularity, low-carbon solutions for Cleanaway and our customers.  Our recent acquisition of Australian Eco Oils is a positive step in this  direction with Used Cooking Oil becoming an important feedstock in the  production of renewable fuel.  Creating shared value is at our core. We prioritise strong customer  partnerships, community education on recycling, and collaboration  with partners like Clean Up Australia to make a positive social and  environmental impact. Our Blueprint 2030 strategy continues to deliver sustainable outcomes   for all stakeholders. Together, we’re making a sustainable future possible.  Stay safe out there,     Mark Schubert  CEO and Managing Director I’m thrilled to share our FY23 Sustainability Report   on behalf of our 7,500+ employees across Australia.  Our business is increasingly becoming more resource  management than waste management; sustainability   is our business and is the core of Blueprint 2030.

To some, waste may seem like an ordinary part of everyday life, but we know  it has extraordinary potential. We see all waste as a resource; so managing  Australia’s waste needs isn’t a matter of asking “where does it go now?”,   but “what can it be next?”. For over 50 years, we have supported Australian businesses by delivering  solutions that offer benefits not only to our customers, but also for the  communities and environment we live in.  With a leading network of advanced resource recovery facilities, transfer  stations, engineered landfills, liquid treatment plants and refineries,   we offer customers an unrivalled capacity to collect, process, treat,   recycle or safely dispose of a variety of waste types.  We aspire to be the most innovative and sustainable waste management  company and see this as fundamental to fulfilling our customer-led   strategy, Blueprint 2030. The strategy focuses on creating superior   value for all our stakeholders; by integrating and extending our leading  network of infrastructure assets to provide high-circularity, low-carbon  solutions, seamless customer service and value for money. This is how  we’re finding better, smarter, and cleaner ways to make a sustainable   future possible together.

Our aim is to unlock the passion, pride and  diversity of our workforce so that we can make  the greatest impact possible. Page 17 Document position Planet Prosperity Foreword Snapshot Introduction About us Appendix Cleanaway Sustainability Report 2023 Page 17 Pillar 1: People People  ===== PAGE 18 ===== Health and safety   Deborah Peach, Executive General Manager, HSE   HSE Leadership Development Program In FY23 we commenced a journey to transform   the way that safety and environment risks are  managed, shifting to a proactive focus as we strive   for industry leading health, safety and environment  (HSE) performance. Developing the strategy for change has involved  gathering feedback from across the business to  understand what is working well and where we   can improve our performance, capability and culture. Starting at the top; we have redefined our HSE vision.  We aim to become an industry leader in safety and  environment performance, enabled by our people,  safe and reliable assets, and an incredible learning  culture. We believe that achieving the highest standards  of health and safety is critical for the success and  sustainability of our business. It also helps to give our  customers, communities, shareholders, and regulators  confidence in our capability. Underpinning our HSE vision are five strategic  imperatives. They include: •	 Brilliant at the basics – excellence in managing HSE risks and compliance  obligations, enabled by fit-for-purpose systems and processes.  •	 Grow HSE leadership, capability and culture – enable visible and  authentic leaders and a competent and empowered workforce. •	 Deliver safe, reliable and sustainable fleet and assets – design,  operate, maintain and upgrade fleet and fixed assets using innovative,  sustainable solutions. •	 Drive business resilience and protection – create a structured approach  to respond to incidents, to protect our people, environment, assets, and  reputation. •	 Embed an incredible learning culture – a curious mindset applied every  day to learn from our successes and failures.  This strategy is supported by a five-year roadmap, which will simplify how we  work and make it easy for our people to make the right choices, every day. It’s more than just a good plan. Programs are already underway to help   bring our vision to life, such as: •	 Reviewing critical risks and controls, including developing simplified  standards, tools and improving risk control definition. •	 Enabling operational safety leadership and culture through our HSE  Leadership Development Program. •	 Enhancing our Fire Risk Management Program, comprising progressive  upgrades of our facilities with rapid detection and response equipment. •	 Engaging our workforce through our ‘Start Strong for HSE’ campaign   to raise awareness and improve workforce engagement.  Safety and Environment are now entrenched as the two  foundations upon which Cleanaway operates. Page 18 Document position Planet Prosperity Foreword Snapshot Introduction About us Appendix Cleanaway Sustainability Report 2023 Health and safety People  ===== PAGE 19 ===== 0 1 2 3 4 5 To support the development and delivery of our strategy and achieve  our vision of industry-leading safety and environment performance,  Cleanaway has appointed an Executive General Manager HSE reporting  directly to the CEO, who has enhanced the capability across the function,  and established a HSE Performance and Innovation Team consisting of  industry professionals committed to our refreshed strategic imperatives.  Our Health and Safety Policy highlights our commitment to our  employees, contractors, and stakeholders. It sets out our risk-based  approach to health and safety across all of our facilities and operations.      Cleanaway Health and Safety Policy Our safety management system covers our entire organisation, and applies  equally to employees, contractors and visitors to our sites. One of the ways  we ensure that our safety management system is effective is to have the  system independently certified to recognised standards.      Cleanaway Business Certifications In FY23, we transitioned from AS4801 to ISO45001 – the international  standard for work health and safety (WHS) management systems. The  system ensures all employees are equipped to perform their role and  activities safely, applying our defined risk controls. Although we continue to invest in safety, unfortunately, isolated but  significant safety incidents have occurred this year.  Tragically, there was one fatality in our operations during the year. The  fatality occurred at our Kemps Creek landfill. At the time of the incident,  the employee of a contractor was undertaking a routine task within  their area of operational control. Immediately following the incident,  Cleanaway performed an enterprise-wide review of processes and controls  relevant to the task. It was only when we were satisfied with outcomes of  this review, that the task was recommenced. We understand that waste collection and processing  inevitably pose risks. We collaborate with our people,   so we can learn how work is being done and make   sure everyone stays safe. Reducing the severity and likelihood of safety risks continues to   be a core area of focus. The instance of recordable safety injuries   is measured and reported as Total Recordable Injury Frequency   Rate (TRIFR). In FY23, we have seen a 12% improvement from   the previous year with a TRIFR rate of 3.7.  This figure represents 82 instances where one of our people   went home injured. We are not satisfied with this performance   and we continue to work intensively to address safety risk and   improve performance.  In FY23, our   TRIFR improved  over FY22 12% FY23 FY24 target 3.7 3.4 FY22 4.2   Cleanaway ESG Databook For more information, please visit: Page 19 Document position Planet Prosperity Foreword Snapshot Introduction About us Appendix Cleanaway Sustainability Report 2023 Health and safety People  ===== PAGE 20 ===== Critical safety risks In FY23, we redefined and accelerated our critical safety risk work  program, which now encompass both personal and process safety.  Underpinning this program is a learners mindset; as we seek to employ  best practice approaches in our work by incorporating learnings from   our industry peers.  Critical risks are the high consequence events that could result in serious  injury or impact to our people, the environment, or our assets. Some  examples include mobile plant and people interaction, road transport  incidents, fires, and falls from height. Throughout the program, the operations and HSE Team are working  together to identify the critical risks and controls, verify the effectiveness  of these controls, and establish ongoing monitoring and assurance to  prevent potential incidents. This forms part of our ongoing efforts to  simplify and improve our approach to risk management at Cleanaway. Core Process development  Our Core Process development is also progressing well with our first   two pilots now complete on Management of Change and Manage  Contract Execution. These are two key safety-related core processes,   now being rolled out Cleanaway-wide. These processes are important  because they provide a consistent approach to manage these risks,   assure the controls, and deliver a platform for continuous improvement. Over the past 12 months, we have: Commenced a review of our  Critical Risks, Life Saving  Rules and Environment  Absolutes. We are simplifying  our standards and tools to make  it easy for our workers to do  their jobs safely every day. Renewed our focus on Chain  of Responsibility (CoR)  obligations, to support safer  management of heavy vehicles  – with a particular focus on  management of driver fatigue.  Progressed an action plan  to manage serious injuries  and High Potential  Incidents. Quality of actions is  also being reviewed to inform  event learning opportunities  and how they can be translated  for company wide impact.  Commenced work to increase  the frequency and quality  of site leadership visits, to help  ensure the most up to date risk  controls are in place. Page 20 Document position Planet Prosperity Foreword Snapshot Introduction About us Appendix Cleanaway Sustainability Report 2023 Health and safety People  ===== PAGE 21 ===== Our Lifesaving Rules   align to our critical risks. The Cleanaway Lifesaving Rules underpin our approach   to workforce safety, health and wellbeing, helping to   raise awareness of critical risks, and the actions we can  take each day to prevent serious injuries or fatal incidents. Safe driving and approaching equipment  Ensure you are licensed and authorised. Drive to   the conditions and avoid distraction. Approach vehicles/ plant only after advising the operator. Fitness for work  Come to work unimpaired by drugs, alcohol or fatigue. High hazard work  Ensure you have authorisation, correct permits and  controls in place before undertaking High Pressure Water  Jetting, Confined Space Tasks or Working at Heights. Hazardous chemicals  Manage all hazardous chemicals in accordance   with risk assessment and procedures. Fire and explosion  Know and control the fire and explosion risks within   your operation. Energy isolation and safety devices  Energy isolations are in place and verified.   Ensure safety devices are operational, with any   change requiring authorisation. Health and safety Cleanaway Lifesaving Rules  Page 21 Document position Planet Prosperity Foreword Snapshot Introduction About us Appendix Cleanaway Sustainability Report 2023 People  ===== PAGE 22 ===== Fire risk management Fire is one of our critical safety risks. The changing nature   of waste, in particular the increasing prevalence of lithium-ion  batteries in everyday goods, is leading to increased fire incidents  and risk across the waste industry. While education and supportive government policy will play an  important role to reduce this risk, we’re acting now to improve our  fire management infrastructure across our business. This activity  includes upgrades of our fire detection and suppression controls to  assure the health and safety of our employees and the communities  in which we operate. In FY23, we formalised and commenced  implementation of a National Interim Fire Suppression Program   so that our workforce gets home safely, every day.  In FY23, forty high-risk fire sites received updated fire suppression  infrastructure and extensive training programs. The program  delivered 78 portable ground monitors to high-risk sites around  Australia earlier this year, with additional hardware to enhance  storage and handling of fire equipment, such as customised storage  cabinets and trolleys. We have also been trialling new fire response  technology including “Fire Rover”, which delivers advanced fire  detection, remote controlled suppression, with 24/7 surveillance. Over the course of FY23, Cleanaway invested around $17 million  to improve our fire infrastructure and related measures to improve  fire safety. In addition to capital investment, the program has involved  auditing sites to assess fire risk and control measures in place.  Training has been delivered at sites to familiarise the teams  with operating equipment and site specific fire management  requirements. Emergency drills were also conducted to improve  knowledge on how to respond to a fire in its earliest stages to  minimise escalation. Cleanaway is taking an innovative  approach, coupled with advanced  technology, to support fire detection   and response at our branches. Page 22 Document position Planet Prosperity Foreword Snapshot Introduction About us Appendix Cleanaway Sustainability Report 2023 Health and safety People  ===== PAGE 23 ===== Start Strong for HSE Program  Case study As part of Cleanaway’s refreshed Health,   Safety and Environment Strategy, in January   2023 we proudly launched our “Start Strong   for HSE” campaign to remind our people to   be switched on in the workplace, to learn   from past events and to work together to   keep each other safe.  Past experience tells us the start of each year brings changes to our  working environment – heat, fatigue, changes in workload, people  returning from break etc. Distractions can avert our attention, upset our  rhythm or put time pressure on our teams to perform. These changes   can result in injuries to people in our teams or harm to the environment.  Throughout FY23, the HSE Team have provided our workforce with  educational materials that focused on some of our key risks. These  included: Mental Health and Wellbeing, Heat Stress and Hydration, Slips,  Trips and Falls, Getting the Basics Right: Personal Protective Equipment  and Housekeeping, Process Safety, and Ergonomics at the Frontline.   These materials are utilised by senior operations staff to engage their  teams, promote discussion and to ensure there are adequate controls   in place to do the job safely.  The Start Strong for HSE Program encourages our teams to listen   and be curious in their learning, while reinforcing behaviours that   ensure we are working together to keep each other safe.  Page 23 Document position Planet Prosperity Foreword Snapshot Introduction About us Appendix Cleanaway Sustainability Report 2023 People  ===== PAGE 24 ===== At Cleanaway, we believe that being safe   is not an individual pursuit. When safety and  environment are foundational to the way we  operate, we work together to keep each other,  the community and the environment safe. In February 2023, we launched the Stronger Together HSE Leadership  program across all Cleanaway branches. The aim of the program is to  grow HSE capability in our leaders to enable strong line ownership of HSE  and improve performance. The program is targeted initially at Business  Unit Leaders, Branch Managers and Frontline Supervisors and will be  expanded to a broader leadership group in FY24. Our Cleanaway teams work in a complex environment. Conditions and  hazards can change daily, highlighting the dynamic nature of our work  and the need for adaptable and tailored HSE programs. The Stronger  Together Program is designed specifically for our working environment.  The face-to-face interactive program draws on the latest research   and techniques to bring out the best in our people and systems.   The program has five modules focused on HSE Leadership and Culture,  Risk Management and Mindsets, Everyday HSE Conversations, Human   and Organisational Principles and Operational Excellence.  During the year, participants attended Modules 1 to 3, which are  aimed at taking our HSE culture and performance to the next  level. Modules 4 and 5 will continue into FY24. Through classroom  experience, robust conversation and on-the-job learning, participants  have increased their knowledge and practical understanding of key  concepts. This program also reinforces the importance of collaboration  and collective responsibility among our leaders in creating a safety  culture where every individual plays a role in protecting themselves,  colleagues, and the environment. We see this program as an investment in our leaders; we remain  committed to learning and improving from each other and embedding  good industry practice.  Stronger Together HSE Leadership Program “Excellent session, topics very relevant and great tools to   apply in the workplace to enable better HSE conversations.” “Super interactive, it is a great way to learn, and expand   my network and connections around the business.” “Loved it.

We understand our work is essential and we instil a   sense of pride within our teams that empowers them   to approach each task with commitment and pride.   We care deeply about the contributions we make to   local communities and our role in developing sustainable,  circular and low-carbon solutions for future generations.  Cleanaway is on a journey to empower our people to take  ownership of our culture across our 330+ sites. Our focus   is on our leaders. We build highly capable leaders, who  think beyond today, have a deep sense of care and create  strong connections.  Our focus is on setting a new standard for behaviour at  Cleanaway, and we are continuously working to create   an environment where everyone feels safe, included   and respected.  In FY23, we completed the internal work to re-imagine   our Cleanaway values, which are aligned to our strategy,  and we are on track to launch these soon. Rather than  simply words on a page, we are focused on bringing our  values to life with actions: how we work, how we lead,  how we show up and how we treat each other.   Our employees bring diverse backgrounds, skills and  experience that benefit our organisation, our customers,  and other key stakeholders. Whether it’s a different cultural  background or a different way of thinking, we see how our  business is stronger with all perspectives being heard.  Prosperity Foreword Cleanaway Sustainability Report 2023 Page 25 Introduction About us Appendix Document position Planet Snapshot People Workplace   culture, diversity  and inclusion  ===== PAGE 26 ===== Flexible work and employment  As part of building a diverse and inclusive workplace, we have   policies that support all employees inside and outside of work.  Our updated parental leave policy came into effect on 1 July 2023.   The policy allows employees who are primary carers to take 18 weeks  of leave, regardless of gender, with eligibility from commencement   of employment with Cleanaway. Secondary carers can now also take  two weeks of leave at full pay. The policy also provides employees   who experience miscarriage or stillbirth paid leave as well as   additional support.  We value the lives that our employees have outside of work,   and want to support them to achieve personal, family, community,   and individual goals.  That’s why we facilitate flexibility for employee working arrangements  for all of our permanent workforce, where operationally practical. Our flexible work arrangements offer opportunities for an employee  and manager to discuss and agree upon changes to when, where and  how a person will work. Considerations include achieving the right  balance between business and individual needs, whilst meeting both  our operational and customer requirements.  From drivers who are job sharing, to compressed working weeks  in corporate roles, our flexible working opportunities are vast.   We continue to look for ways to support our employees to balance  their home and work commitments.

We recognise their unique position as the   original custodians of Australia. Our vision is for full inclusion and  participation of First Nations reconciliation in our operations and  partnerships, which we act upon through education, employment,  procurement and providing a culturally safe workplace.  As an organisation committed to Reconciliation, we are excited   to have begun working on a new Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP),   which will be submitted to Reconciliation Australia in FY24. As a business with more than 330 sites, from Western Australia to  Queensland, Tasmania to the Northern Territory, we know that we   have the opportunity to support First Nations employees, suppliers   and communities and look forward to our new Reconciliation Action  Plan outlining these commitments further.  Over FY23, we continued to build upon our progress with   reconciliation work with an ongoing focus of awareness raising,  education on the Voice to Parliament and cultural inclusion. Indigenous recruitment Cleanaway is committed to working collaboratively with First Nations  communities across Australia. We have formed several partnerships  with organisations focused on providing employment and business  development opportunities while increasing genuine engagement   with local communities to work together for a sustainable future.

Tony’s indigenous art pieces have built up a significant following on   the Diversity and Inclusion group on Cleanaway’s Workplace platform.  The platform connects and uplifts the voices of our employees right  across Australia.  As a Wiradjuri man, Tony is part of the largest group of Aboriginal   people in Central New South Wales. With limited contact with his   birth family, his artwork is a way for him to connect with his culture.   “It’s a way to help me stay connected to my identity as a fair-skinned  black man,” Tony explains.  Tony joined the Cleanaway team as a Transfer Station Operator in late  2021 and is enjoying progressing his career at Cleanaway. “Every day is  different. I also like knowing that I am a valued team member. I’ve never  had a job before where I’ve felt as appreciated as I do here”.  As an inclusive Australian company with a workforce consisting of   people with diverse cultures, values, backgrounds etc, we recognise   our responsibility for supporting First Nations peoples’ participation  across our workforce.  We are taking an active role in contributing to reconciliation with  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. As part of National  Reconciliation Week 2023, we asked Tony for his reconciliation   message to Australia. Tony says, “It’s about using the knowledge   of the past to encourage and bring in a brighter future.” Tony Levett:  Transfer Station Operator Every day is different.

Throughout FY23, we made significant progress in increasing   the number of females employed across Cleanaway; however,   we acknowledge there is more work to be done. Females in  operational roles increased to 10.0%, up from 7.4% in the   previous year Similarly, the overall proportion of females   employed at Cleanaway increased to 22.8%, up from 20.8%   in the previous year. Our new parental leave policy, flexible work arrangements,   our Driver Academy and initiatives such as Respect@Cleanaway   are some examples of what we are doing to create opportunities   for greater gender balance. Gender pay gap Cleanaway is committed to the principles of pay equality   where equal work results in equal pay outcomes regardless   of a person’s gender, culture, ethnicity or any other personal  attributes. Our Reward and Remuneration Framework seeks   to provide all employees with an equal opportunity to be  compensated for their work based on skills, performance and  objective outcomes aligned to the achievement of our overall  business goals. Whilst we strive to achieve pay parity, we acknowledge minor  variability may occur as a result of factors such as employee  turnover, new to role, promotion and market related increases.   We actively monitor and address these minor variations should they  arise. For more information, view the Cleanaway ESG Databook:     Cleanaway ESG Databook An important part of fostering   a diverse and inclusive workplace   is increasing female participation. 40:40 vision In FY22, we introduced new female participation targets   aligned to our 40:40 Vision. We have challenged ourselves to  achieve at least 40% females in the Executive Team (defined as  CEO+1) by 2027. This target has been broadened to include at  least 40% females in leadership roles (defined as CEO+2) by 2030.

When Kristina first came across the opportunity to join Cleanaway   as a driver in our Container Deposit Scheme (CDS), she had never  driven a truck before. Inspired by the prospect of a new career path and more financial  independence, she studied and successfully passed the required   Heavy Vehicle driver test, and acquired a licence. First securing a role   as a casual driver in the CDS program in 2018, she worked her way   up to full time hours.  Now a Manager of Cleanaway’s Driver Academy, Kristina takes pride   in leading a program that helps to increase female participation in   the waste management industry. Kristina says “My role is extremely  fulfilling and has meant I’m able to give back to women in our society”.  “Due to the stability and strong financial income a driver role provides,  this can be a life-changing career move for many women. It allows them  to live a better standard of life and independently support their families   – especially if they have experienced or are experiencing hardship.” Cleanaway’s Driver Academy was launched in  2022, aiming to give women, female-identifying  and non-binary people outside of the waste  management industry an opportunity to start   a new career path as a heavy vehicle driver.  My aim is to always support   and empower women into   successful careers in the driving  industry and non-traditional roles.” Page 30 Document position Planet Prosperity Foreword Snapshot Introduction About us Appendix Cleanaway Sustainability Report 2023 Employee   spotlight People  ===== PAGE 31 ===== This includes helping people to get support when they need it.   Our employees and their families have access to an Australian-owned,  innovative, and well-respected Employee Assistance Program (EAP). The EAP provides Cleanaway employees and their family members   with free and confidential assistance for work-related issues such   as changing processes, conflict at work, career development,   harassment or discrimination issues as well as work/life balance  concerns. Managers can also get specific assistance with supporting   staff on their mental health. The EAP also provides support for   personal issues that are not work-related, including relationship  concerns, mental health issues including anxiety and depression,  substance use issues, legal or money worries, nutrition and lifestyle,   and child or elder care.  Respect@Cleanaway We recognise that instilling the importance of care, respect and   empathy among our workforce is an ongoing process. In the past,  instances of bullying, harassment, discrimination across our   organisation have been identified.  We do not tolerate any employee behaviour that undermines our   culture and impacts on our people’s ability to perform their jobs safely.  To tackle these challenges, we have launched Respect@Cleanaway   at the beginning of FY24. This is a holistic program aimed to prevent   and respond to workplace bullying, harassment and discrimination   more effectively, and is an important precursor to our values roll-out.   This program will address the issue on a number of fronts: Leadership   The Cleanaway Executive Team has made a clear statement to   the organisation that acknowledges the issues while denouncing   disrespectful behaviour.   Culture   New organisational values will be launched that will weave genuine  care, connection and embracing difference into the foundations of our  workplace. This includes the launch of a Speak Up campaign that will  better help employees to understand the importance of a culture built   on care and respect while ensuring our workforce feels empowered to  “speak up” and report disrespectful behaviours.  Education   A refreshed approach to workplace education and training will be  implemented that addresses workplace respect issues and embeds a  deeper understanding of expected workplace behaviours and processes. Reporting   We are working to improve our measurement of disrespectful behaviours  to better understand its prevalence, scope, nature and impacts. It will  mean tailored workplace initiatives and enable earlier intervention. Work constitutes a large portion of our life, so it’s   important that our workplaces are safe, supportive and  professionally satisfying. Our employee wellbeing initiatives  help our people to feel mentally well, perform at their best,  and flourish in other areas of their life.

Balanced and productive  Workplace Relations practices  that shape our people,  customers, and community. Delivering practical industrial  instruments that provide for  a forward thinking and agile,  simple, and clear Workplace  Relations Framework. We continue to focus on: With over half of the Cleanaway workforce covered by an  Enterprise Agreement (EA), it is important to us that our  people feel they have a respected and heard voice in the  enterprise bargaining process. We are working to achieve  agreements that best reflect their needs, balanced with  the needs of our business that best service our customer  contracts, both now and into the future. Cleanaway currently has 107 EAs. During COVID-19   the company deferred bargaining on 28 EAs and when  bargaining recommenced, additional EAs had expired,  adding to the growing list of expired agreements.  In FY23, we negotiated 40 expired EAs, enabling us to shift  the landscape from reactive bargaining (in an unprotected  period) to proactive bargaining (in the protected period),  mitigating future risk of industrial disputation from FY24.  We took this opportunity to simplify and standardise   our EA templates to ensure the terms and conditions   are market relevant and contemporary, in support of   our ability to attract and retain our workforce. We have  also taken the opportunity to look to consolidate EAs.   This work will continue through future EA negotiations.  We acknowledge that as part of our EA negotiations,  there have been some disruptions arising from industrial  action. 60% of all protected industrial action in FY23 was  taken in Sydney Metro across three depots and we have  worked closely with all affected customers to mitigate the  impact and ensure the ongoing delivery of essential waste  collection services occured.  Looking forward, we will continue to focus on closing out  the remaining expired EAs, with the second half of FY24  moving back into a proactive bargaining position. We will  spend time investing in relationship building activities  with our workforce, aligned to our Workplace Relations  Strategy that is designed to support the new Cleanaway  values and culture.  Cleanaway is committed to creating labour conditions   that ensure our people are happy, healthy and rewarded.

The program flips the traditional mentoring format on its head,   so both people get the opportunity to learn. Executives are   matched with Branch and Operations Managers; meeting with   their mentee to listen and learn about their role, and reflect on  how the organisation can support them. The program is delivered  through one-on-one mentoring meetings, phone calls and site visits.  Alan now feels as though the executive leaders are available to help,  and it’s given him confidence approaching the Executive Team.  Alan says, “The program is a great opportunity to meet with  someone from the Executive Team and truly feel as though they  were interested in my day and what they can do to support me.  They want to hear from us and understand the challenges that   we encounter.  Branch managers need to take this step and reach out for the  support that is available to them.” Unlocking the benefits of diversity in our organisation is key to the  successful execution of Blueprint 2030 and our ongoing performance  through retention, engagement and growth. Cleanaway is committed to embedding diversity and inclusion  initiatives into our broader talent management processes including  training, development and succession planning. By doing this, we will  support the development of all of our people and ensure that they  have access to the appropriate development opportunities to prepare  them for technical specialist or senior leadership positions, if they  choose.  During the year, we implemented several successful strategies with  good progress made in addressing labour shortages. Our Recruitment  Process Outsourcing Program and the Cleanaway Driver Academy have  helped in filling vacancies.  We implemented the Reverse Mentoring Program, which provides  employees and executives a unique opportunity to exchange skills,  knowledge and understanding. It helps our people build relationships  and break down any barriers with the Executive Team. For more  detailed data, including, employee turnover, please visit the Cleanaway  ESG Databook.

Page 36 Document position Prosperity Foreword Snapshot About us People Appendix Cleanaway Sustainability Report 2023 Introduction Pillar 2: Planet Planet  ===== PAGE 37 ===== Managing environmental risk was once seen as a priority alongside  financial and safety performance. During FY22, we reset both safety  and environment as our foundations to everything we do. In FY23, we commenced a journey to transform the way that we  manage risks to the environment. Compliance with the obligations  and specific conditions attached to the regulator-issued environmental  licences at our sites is therefore foundational.  As part of this transformation, we are integrating safety and  environment performance into a single way of working to simplify  how we work. The same five strategic imperatives set out in the Health  and Safety section apply to our transformation of environment risk  management, along with the risk-prioritised five-year HSE Roadmap.  Our environmental management system has a framework for  considering our environmental impact in each aspect of our work   and outlines ways of working for our employees, contractors and  visitors to our sites. The environmental management system is  independently certified to international standard ISO14001.     Cleanaway Business Certifications Our commitment to protect the environment is set out in the  Cleanaway Environment Policy. Central to this policy are our  Environment Absolutes, which set the foundation for how we   manage environmental risk and compliance.  Cleanaway Environment Absolutes Soil protection Liquids stored in properly  maintained bunded areas   and solids stored on a   sealed surface. Water protection Stormwater system managed  and maintained to regulatory  standards. Compliance to   regulatory licence Material can only be accepted   and activities undertaken in   accord with licence conditions. Air protection Air pollution control   equipment maintained   to regulatory standards   and in operation. The collection, recovery, treatment and disposal   of many waste streams can be inherently hazardous  and must be carefully managed to minimise the risk  of harm to the environment and the communities   in which we operate.  Page 37 Document position Prosperity Foreword Snapshot About us People Appendix Cleanaway Sustainability Report 2023 Introduction Environmental   risk management   Cleanaway Environment Policy Planet  ===== PAGE 38 ===== In the dynamic and highly regulated waste industry,   we strive to maintain appropriate environmental  performance standards throughout our operations   at all times. While we are working hard to improve and embed  industry-leading standards, from time to time, incidents  and non-compliances can occur given the breath and  complexity of our operations. As we continue to embed our environment standards   and enhance capability across our business, there has   been a sustained reduction in direction notices from   state-based environmental regulators. In FY23, we received   a total of 12 direction notices and 13 formal warnings,   a significant reduction from the 36 direction notices  and 8 formal warnings received in the previous year.  Over FY23, Cleanaway was issued five fines from   our environmental regulators, totalling $57,214.   This compares to four fines totalling $14,678 in FY22.  Three fines were issued for matters relating to record  keeping, one was issued in relation to storage of  hazardous materials and one in relation to operation   of plant and equipment. Over the same period, two  court imposed penalties to a total value of $38,000  were also incurred for non-compliance with licence  conditions. Both of these matters relate to events prior  to FY23, and no environmental harm was alleged.  Each is an opportunity for learning and improvement,  which in turn brings us closer to achieving our mission   of making a sustainable future possible together. As with previous years, our FY24 target is zero significant   or major rated environment incidents.  At Cleanaway, we are focused on upholding  the highest environmental standards and  complying with our regulatory obligations. Page 38 Document position Prosperity Foreword Snapshot About us People Appendix Introduction Cleanaway Sustainability Report 2023 Environmental  compliance Planet  ===== PAGE 39 ===== Environmental Risk Register  Cleanaway sites considered high-risk are required to prepare  a site-specific environment risk register – identifying activities  with environmental risks and how environmental impacts will   be mitigated.  Licence Compliance Tool  Many of our sites are regulated by complex environmental  licences. This tool lists all of the relevant conditions, allowing  managers to record details of their site’s compliance against  these conditions. It shows each site’s compliance and is an  invaluable tool for regulator audits and inspections, where the  required evidence can be sourced efficiently and accurately.  Air Discharge Register  This register details air emission discharge points. It includes  both point source emissions (emissions discharged from a stack  or definitive source) and diffuse sources (such as dust rising  from unsealed roads, or odour from a site activity).  Stormwater Management Plan  This plan documents the stormwater system at our sites,  considering both the infrastructure and the controls required  to minimise impact to stormwater from our operations during  both everyday and emergency situations such as a fire or spill.   Liquid and Solid Waste Storage Plan  This plan is used to determine how waste is to be stored  on-site. It sets out procedures to ensure that waste is   lawfully accepted and stored, that no prohibited waste is  accepted, and that risk to the environment and surrounding  communities is managed. To ensure our operations meet   the requirements of the Cleanaway  environmental management system  and Environmental Absolutes, we  are simplifying and standardising  the tools in place at each site.  These tools aim to support  workers to identify risks to the  environment in their day-to-day  work, while providing a list of  management strategies and controls  to guide our teams to achieve  environmental compliance.  Page 39 Document position Prosperity Foreword Snapshot About us People Appendix Cleanaway Sustainability Report 2023 Introduction Environmental  compliance Planet  ===== PAGE 40 ===== The complex and dynamic nature of managing  waste means that incidents may occur from time   to time. A fire event occurred onsite at our Artarmon Transfer Station in Sydney   on 4 December 2022 which burned through until the next morning.   The site was fully evacuated during the event and there were no injuries   to our people or any members of the public.  On site, employees and fire crews were able to contain the impact   of the fire damage and we kept the site closed to allow for active  communication with our customers, neighbouring businesses,   and residents within the local area.  Despite significant on-site firewater holding capacity, a portion of   fire-fighting foam concentrate and firewater made its way to a local  waterway. Once alerted to this, our team acted with urgency to limit  environmental damage, using vacuum trucks, floating booms and   hand tools to skim the surface of the water. Since the incident,   water quality has returned to pre-incident levels. The changing nature of waste and in particular lithium-ion batteries   is leading to increased fire incidents and risk across the waste industry.   That’s why we’re continuing to invest in educating the public and our  customers on the correct waste disposal practices. We are also enhancing   our fire detection and suppression controls for when fires do occur,   and our emergency response actions to ensure the safety of our  people and local communities. Learning from environmental incidents The safety of our people, the  community and the environment  underpins everything we do   at Cleanaway.”   Cleanaway Education Resources   Fire risk management Page 40 Document position Prosperity Foreword Snapshot About us People Appendix Cleanaway Sustainability Report 2023 Introduction Case study Planet  ===== PAGE 41 ===== Gas flare Ground water monitoring wells Ground water Leachate  pond Closed cell with gas extraction wells Engineered  composite  cell liner  Drainage layer Landfill  capping Compacted waste mass Dozer Weighbridge Solid waste Leachate collection wells Renewable electricity generation Gas  monitoring well Incoming waste loads are  managed using a ‘weighbridge’,  to ensure waste meets licence  requirements and to confirm that  the weight of each load adheres  to the contracts we have with our  customers.    ‘Cells’ divide modern landfills,   so that sites are managed   in sections to ensure material   is properly separated, covered,  and landfill gas and leachate are  managed.    These cells are highly engineered  areas, designed with advanced  composite material liners to  minimise the chance of any  waste or contaminated materials  escaping the confines of the cell.    Within each cell are leachate   and landfill gas collection systems  that captures these by-products  of waste decomposition – helping  to reduce our impact on the  environment.  Our 1.5° ambition outlines   how we’re reducing our carbon  footprint, including through   the capture of landfill gas.    Collected landfill gas can be  cleaned and then used by  Cleanaway or third parties to  generate renewable electricity or  used as renewable gas. A B B C D E D A C E Well-designed and engineered landfills remain a critical   part of Australia’s waste management system.  Increased recovery of food, construction and demolition  waste and transition to Energy from Waste will change  the role of landfilling but will not remove its necessity;  we must have a means of safely disposing of waste that  cannot either be reused, recycled or recovered. Cleanaway has eight open landfills that we own and  operate, deploying best-in-class management and highly  technical engineering to ensure the safety and compliance  of our sites, whilst minimising impact to the surrounding  environment. Cleanaway’s Landfill Optimisation Blueprint looks at how  we can make the most of these highly engineered pieces  of infrastructure to continue delivering value into the  future through airspace optimisation and energy capture.  Landfill capacity, or airspace, is a valuable and finite  resource. Preserving this resource highlights the  importance of working together with our customers  and partners to maximise resource recovery. By stopping  valuable materials, such as construction and demolition  waste and organics from ending up in landfill, we  maximise the space left for residual waste.  With all of Cleanaway’s operating landfills now capturing  gas and further investment being made to optimise usage,  these assets will continue to be important long into the  future.    Melbourne Regional Landfill Explainer Page 41 Document position Prosperity Foreword Snapshot About us People Appendix Cleanaway Sustainability Report 2023 Introduction The role   of landfill   1.5°C ambition Planet  ===== PAGE 42 ===== Cleanaway, together with Griffith University,   is revolutionising the way landfill is rehabilitated  as part of a ground-breaking partnership at our  New Chum facility in Ipswich, Queensland. A research project headed by Dr Ruby Michael and PhD candidate   Tony Kim, from Griffith’s School of Engineering and Built Environment,   has transformed a two-hectare site at New Chum into a lush natural  ecosystem that doubles as an effective and efficient way to cap the  completed cell.  Dr Michael is part of Griffith’s Green Infrastructure Research Labs   and an expert in phytocapping, a technology that uses a combination   of soil and native vegetation to act as a bio-pump and control the   amount of rainfall that filters through to compacted waste.  Traditional landfill capping involves ‘hard infrastructure’ solutions like  geosynthetic clay liners as part of a multi-layered system. In contrast,  phytocapping has better environmental outcomes while delivering the  same engineering performance. This alternative re-establishes a native  ecosystem by using a non-compacted soil layer and planting it with  an urban forest. The results at New Chum have shown some trees and plants growing and  thriving at a faster rate than expected. What was a bare, covered landfill  cell is now a patch of attractive bushland that is home to a thriving range  of native plants and animals.  The partnership aligns the values of Cleanaway and Griffith University –  both as leaders in the circular economy, with a desire to ensure the land   is rehabilitated for future use.  This project will provide valuable data to help inform the selection of   the most appropriate final capping solution of the site; whether that   be a phytocap, traditional cap or hybrid solution. Cleanaway look forward to another two years of productive partnership  with Griffith University.

This site has been operated by Cleanaway for over a decade and is regulated by the  South Australian Environmental Protection Agency (EPA SA). In 2020, we applied to  EPA SA for a licence to manage Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS).  During production and use, PFAS can easily move into the environment. As PFAS   do not break down, they remain in the environment for long periods of time,   giving rise to the name ‘forever chemical’.  Scientific studies have shown that exposure to some PFAS in the environment   may be linked to harmful health effects in humans and animals. That’s why we   need a safe and well-controlled means for disposing of PFAS-contaminated waste. Working collaboratively with the SA EPA, Cleanaway undertook a range of extensive  groundwater monitoring tests and conducted stakeholder engagement with local  groups to assess how this new licence may impact nearby communities. This included  consultation with the Inkerman Landfill Community Reference Group, comprising  adjacent landowners, representatives from the Wakefield Regional Council,  Cleanaway, and EPA SA.  Our cooperation, consultation and meticulous environmental risk procedures led to  EPA SA approving a licence for the Inkerman landfill to receive PFAS-contaminated  solid waste in 2023. The decision came after a rigorous 2.5-year assessment process,  and means we can provide South Australia with a safe and contained disposal site   for PFAS-contaminated waste. For more information, please visit: Inkerman landfill:   Landfill optimisation in action PFAS are man-made chemicals  that have been used in industry  and consumer products worldwide  since the 1940s.  They have been used to make a  wide variety of common products,  including non-stick cookware,  water-repellent clothing, stain  resistant fabrics and carpets,   and some firefighting foams.

For Cleanaway,  that means initially focusing on reducing  methane emissions from our landfills through  improved landfill gas capture. The methane gas produced at our landfills is derived from   the biogenic waste streams (waste from organic matter such  as plants and animals). Landfill gas is a renewable natural gas  source. When this gas is captured, it reduces our reportable  fugitive methane emissions. Futhermore, when it is converted  into electricity or sold directly to customers as landfill gas,  landfill gas is treated as renewable energy, helping to reduce  our customers’ carbon footprint. In FY23, we improved the efficiency of landfill gas capture   by 15% across our portfolio of landfills. We did this by drilling  more than 250 landfill gas wells, improving infrastructure  design, and optimising existing well infrastructure to reduce  our methane emissions. To reduce our carbon dioxide emissions, we are trialling   new technologies and evaluating fuel-switching for our   heavy vehicle fleet. Cleanaway earns carbon credits for many of its emission  reduction activities. Activities that generate carbon credits  include landfill gas management practices that exceed  performance benchmarks set by the Australian government,   as well as via avoided methane emissions through composting. Our philosophy is simple. We seek to maximise environmental  benefit through tangible emission reduction activities, and  then maximise the value to shareholders by selling excess  carbon credits that we have earned. The generation, surrender,  and purchase of recognised carbon offsets outside of our  operations may be used to complement direct reduction   of greenhouse gas emissions.   Cleanaway’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions  are comprised of 74% methane and 26%  carbon dioxide. Our emissions in FY23 Page 44 Document position Prosperity Foreword Snapshot About us People Appendix Cleanaway Sustainability Report 2023 Introduction 1.5°C ambition  Planet  ===== PAGE 45 ===== Jul  Aug  Sept  Oct  Nov  Dec  Jan  Feb  Mar  Apr  May  Jun kt 1,150 kt 1,250 kt 1,350 1,250kt CO2-e Net emissions  1,189kt CO2-e NGERs emissions Gross emissions Net impact of carbon credit  addition and subtraction Greenhouse gas emission reduction targets  Our methane and carbon dioxide greenhouse gas emissions reduction  targets are aligned to the most conservative 1.5°C scenarios presented in  the sixth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change, and are consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C above  pre-industrial levels by 2100. The methane targets are also aligned to the  Global Methane Pledge.  Our emissions reduction are baselined off of FY22, which was adjusted  in FY23 to reflect the acquisition of Global Renewables Holdings Pty  Ltd. This adjustment is in line with accounting rules established by the  World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable  Development GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. We track our performance against these targets on a net emissions basis.  Cleanaway’s net greenhouse gas emissions position is determined by: •	 Total gross Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions as reported  under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Scheme (NGERS)  and calculated using prescribed methodologies (1,189kt CO2e).  •	 Addition of all Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) issued in the  financial year from abatement projects registered with the Australian  Government (608,701 units). •	 Subtraction of ACCUs deemed surrendered (290,204 units), and   third-party carbon credits surrendered (257,564 units). In FY23, Cleanaway’s total gross Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse   gas emissions were 1,131kt CO2-e and 58kt CO2-e respectively. This was  achieved through direct reduction of greenhouse gas emissions at our  operated assets, primarily at our landfills. To maximise environment and shareholder value, ACCUs awarded to  Cleanaway were sold, and high-integrity international carbon credits   were purchased to reduce our net greenhouse gas emissions to meet   our emissions reduction target.             Verified Emissions Reduction Gold Standard international credits were  purchased in accordance with our carbon offset procurement strategy,   and relate to landfill gas collection and destruction – an activity that is  closely aligned to our core business. Taking into account the addition and surrender of ACCUs awarded   to Cleanaway, and the surrender of high-quality international credits,  Cleanaway’s FY23 net Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions   were 1,250kt CO2-e*, equalling our FY23 reduction objective.  We remain on track to meet our net 2030 greenhouse gas emissions  reduction targets for methane and carbon dioxide. Refer to the ESG  Databook for further information.

To maximise shareholder value, in FY23 we sold   Australian Carbon Credit Units created and acquired   credits from high quality international projects in   line with our carbon offset procurement strategy.  Prosperity Foreword Cleanaway Sustainability Report 2023 Page 46 Introduction About us Appendix Document position Snapshot People Planet 1.5°C ambition   ===== PAGE 47 ===== Vehicle fleet emissions Cleanaway has an extensive network of vehicles that keep waste  management operations moving across Australia, therefore  reducing emissions from this fleet can make a significant impact.  Currently our fleet is mostly powered by diesel, making it our  second largest contributor to our greenhouse gas emissions.  Our FY22 Sustainability Report outlined green hydrogen as   a potential low-carbon fuel source to replace diesel. This is an  aspiration in the long term, as hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are   not yet a viable commercial solution. Key challenges include   the low availability of hydrogen and hydrogen vehicles, and   limited refuelling infrastructure. These impede our transition   to a hydrogen powered fleet.  However, given the role hydrogen may play in the longer term,  we are procuring two hydrogen fuel cell heavy vehicles for use  in the Viva Energy New Energies Service Station Project, in which  we are a foundation partner. This will give us valuable insight in  operating and maintaining hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. Electric vehicles may also provide an alternative for our fleet.   To explore this, we have participated in electric vehicle trials and  currently have an active electric vehicle servicing our Newcastle  municipal market. We continue to invest in battery electric yellow  gear such as forklifts at a number of our recycling facilities. Beyond battery electric vehicles, we are also evaluating the  feasibility of switching to lower-carbon replacement fuels   such as renewable diesel, to reduce our fleet emissions.    Document position Prosperity Foreword Snapshot About us People Appendix Introduction Page 47 Cleanaway Sustainability Report 2023 1.5°C ambition  Planet  ===== PAGE 48 ===== Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time.  Government, business, and community alike have a collective  responsibility to take action and secure a better future. At Cleanaway, we are taking action by reducing our own  greenhouse gas emissions in line with a 1.5°C pathway,   and supporting our customers and the community to lower   their emissions through better waste management. Climate risks and opportunities Cleanaway understands and acts on its responsibility to identify and  respond to physical and transitional climate risks, and ensure climate  change adaptation, mitigation, and resilience strategies are embedded   in Cleanaway’s Risk Management Framework.  Some of the ways we are embedding climate change considerations   into our work include: •	 Reducing our own greenhouse gas emissions in line with   a 1.5°C pathway. •	 Understanding climate risks and opportunity through research   and scenario analysis. •	 Embedding climate risk management in the Enterprise Risk  Management Framework. •	 Bringing climate risk mitigation into focus as part of our strategic  decision making. Cleanaway identifies and manages climate change risk in alignment with  the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on  Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). For more information on  Cleanaway’s broader governance and risk management processes, refer to:     Cleanaway Corporate Governance Page 48 Document position Prosperity Foreword Snapshot About us People Appendix Cleanaway Sustainability Report 2023 Introduction Climate change Planet  ===== PAGE 49 ===== Climate risks and opportunities  Our first assessment of climate risks and opportunities   was undertaken in FY20, drawing on two scenarios from the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report.  Risks identified from this assessment included: •	 Reduced service demand from carbon-intensive industries,   as they contract in response to more urgent decarbonisation   of the economy. •	 Cost increases from the introduction of an explicit or implied   carbon price. •	 Asset risk due to an increase in the frequency and severity   of extreme weather events.  A total of 263 assets were modelled for a range of hazards including riverine  and surface water flooding, coastal inundation, soil movement, extreme heat,  forest fire and extreme wind. Results from this modelling suggested that  Cleanaway’s assets are not highly impacted by climate variability. Along with these risks, there are also opportunities associated with   a transition to a higher-circularity, low-carbon economy, such as: •	 Government policies that favour the domestic recycling industry   to reduce embodied carbon emissions (e.g. container deposits   schemes and investment in recycling infrastructure). •	 The emergence of new streams to manage waste and the growth   of low-carbon solutions for existing waste streams. •	 Utilisation of the inherent energy contained in waste and incentives   to invest in Energy from Waste plants. We are currently updating our climate risk and opportunity assessment and  scenario analysis, with the help of a third-party consultant. This assessment  is being undertaken in alignment with the Task Force on Climate-related  Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Good Practice Handbook (2nd Edition 2021),  leveraging the expertise of the people at Cleanaway in combination with  broader sector-based climate expertise.  The climate scenario analysis will enhance our understanding of climate   change impacts on our business and will be used to inform actions that  may be required. The refreshed scenario analysis will be informed by specific climate risks and  opportunities. The analysis will utilise the Shared Socio-economic Pathways  (SSPs1) from the IPCC AR6 and the Representative Concentration Pathways  (RCPs2) from the IPCC AR6 climate scenarios. We expect this modelling to   be completed over the course of FY24.    Cleanaway’s assessment using   the TCFD Framework is set out   in our Cleanaway ESG Databook.  Outcomes of the updated climate  scenario analysis will be added   when complete.   Cleanaway ESG Databook Cleanaway is currently updating its climate risk  and opportunity assessment and scenario analysis  to reflect current science, policy, and activities.  Page 49 Document position Prosperity Foreword Snapshot About us People Appendix Cleanaway Sustainability Report 2023 Introduction Climate change Planet  ===== PAGE 50 ===== Our goal is to support the transition to a more sustainable  future. Enabling a circular economy is one of the ways we  will get there. A circular economy closes the loop on the products we  consume by maximising the reuse of recovered resources in  the remanufacturing process. It encourages continual reuse  and recycling of valuable resources.  It is important to distinguish circularity from landfill  diversion – they are not the same. By way of example,  incorporating glass fines or plastic in construction materials  diverts this resource from landfill and gives it another use. A circular solution would involve these valuable resources  being made into the same or similar products, for reuse and  recirculation, again and again. Our mission is to offer the most circular and lowest carbon  solutions for our customers. We are continuously finding  new ways to collect, process, treat, recycle and dispose of  waste – helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and   our impact on the climate.  Cleanaway Circularity Hierarchy The Cleanaway Circularity Hierarchy recognises that  different recycling solutions deliver different degrees  of environmental benefits. Importantly, it prioritises  supporting domestic, then international circularity   over downcycling. As Australia’s leading waste management  company, we see waste as a resource and  recognise the value it can generate. We can’t do this alone.  Collaboration across the waste value chain is critical  in creating a circular economy. Market dynamics  are continuously evolving, presenting us with new  opportunities to work in partnership with organisations  that share our vision to enable innovative resource  recovery solutions.

Cleanaway is one of Australia’s largest collectors of   PET, HDPE and PP plastics through our involvement with  container deposit schemes, including logistics partner  for NSW’s Return and Earn, Queensland and Western  Australia’s Containers for Change, as well as our national  capability operating material recovery facilities (MRFs),  which sort kerbside recycling. Through our partnership with TOMRA Cleanaway, we will  soon be involved as the West Zone Network Operator for  the Victorian Container Deposit Scheme (CDS).  The program commencing 1 November 2023, will  encourage Victorians to recycle cans, cartons and   bottles by dropping these items at return points.  As partners, TOMRA Cleanaway’s role will involve  managing the Western Zone of the Victorian CDS  Network of return points, including reverse vending  machines, over-the-counter drop offs and automated  depots. Together, we will also ensure the resources  collected through the scheme are sent to appropriate  destinations for recycling.  We’re proud to be involved and look forward to   helping to create better environmental outcomes   for all Victorians.

Circular Plastics Australia (PET)  CPA (PET) is a joint venture between Pact Group Holdings Ltd,  Cleanaway Waste Management Ltd, Asahi Beverages and Coca- Cola Europacific Partners. The Circular Plastics Australia (PET)  facility in Albury will create around 20,000 tonnes of recycled  PET each year by processing up to 28,000 tonnes of feedstock  collected from kerbside recycling and container deposit  schemes. This is the equivalent of recycling around 1 billion  600ml PET plastic bottles each year.  The PET resin produced by the facility is used by Asahi  Beverages and Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (JV Partners) to  manufacture the new 100% recycled PET beverage bottles and  by Pact Group to make food packaging. Cleanaway plays an  important role in providing available PET feedstock through  our collection and sorting network.  Together, all four companies share a commitment to investing  in a circular economy and closing the plastic loop in Australia.

Waste oils, including engine oil, hydraulic oil and used lube  oil must be handled safely with a stringent focus on waste tracking.  Regulatory authorities enforce strict guidelines for managing these   waste steams due to their potential to create environmental hazards.  However, unlike other materials, waste oil possesses a unique   attribute in that it can be re-refined into new base and fuel oils,   aiding in the development of a circular economy.  The Product Stewardship for Oil Scheme plays a pivotal role   in encouraging increased collection and recycling of waste oils,   often referred to as sump oils. This initiative aims to close the loop  on petroleum-based and synthetic oils such as lubricant base oils,  transmission oils, brake fluids and hydraulic oils.  Cleanaway, through our hydrocarbons business unit, stands   as a prominent participant in this circular economy framework.   Through the collection of used lubricating oils, we consolidate   the waste into economically viable volumes that are transported   to our licenced processing sites for treatment and recycling.  These facilities utilise a sophisticated process to transform   the waste oil into valuable fuel, process oils and lubricating   base stock. These recycled oils effectively replace traditional   crude-oil based products for a wide range of applications,   benefitting industries such as brickworks, smelters, kilns, sugar  manufacturing, fertiliser production and meat processing.  In FY23, Cleanaway processed more than 105 million litres of used   waste oil at our refineries, demonstrating our dedication to reducing  industry reliance on and consumption of fossil fuels, while supporting  the journey toward a circular economy. Our approach to waste oil  management exemplifies the potential for transformation within   the industry.

Sales force effectiveness Cleanaway’s sales teams are set up to work closely with our diverse  customer base to help them understand the potential of our waste  services offering. Spanning the country, representatives and Account  Managers are experts in the services provided by their business unit  (BU) and the unique qualities of their region. Cleanaway’s decentralised model keeps our sales teams close to the  operational service of the customer but can risk inconsistency as  each BU matures differently. Local issues and staff turnover have put  pressure on how effective sales teams can be day-to-day. That’s why  we have a Sales force Effectiveness Blueprint to leverage best practice  sales methods across our field sales teams to drive performance  improvements, increase customer focus and retain our sales  employees.  The first horizon in the Blueprint strategy was to ensure a high-quality,  consistent selling approach that brings together customer need and  sales expertise. It involved training to minimise complexity in the  selling process and set salespeople up for success. Ninety percent of  the sales force have received the training so far and the principles have  been included in the sales onboarding process and ‘Sales Playbook’.  Our sales team are energised with a stronger focus on customer  outcomes. Early data from the team members who completed the  training shows increased face-to-face activities and increased open  opportunities. This important investment in our people’s skills has  improved retention and wellbeing within the sales force while  boosting morale.  By getting the basics right, our sales team now have more bandwidth  to focus on the Cleanaway customer proposition: seamless service  delivery, value for money and sustainability. Future horizons for this  Blueprint will focus on offering more of Cleanaway’s services across  the total waste management proposition. Building on our promise of quality service, great value and  sustainable waste solutions, we’ve invested in key initiatives that  will provide these benefits to our customers into the future.

That’s why  our work for Curtin University, in which we’ve  improved landfill diversion by nearly 47% over  three years, is such a strong testament to our  sustainable customer solutions value proposition.  In 2019, Curtin University were looking for a service provider that could  do more than remove the waste. They wanted a partner to proactively  manage their whole waste system.  Cleanaway was the chosen supplier due to our efficient, cost-effective  and sustainable waste management solutions – a natural fit with Curtin  University’s organisational needs, values and sustainability targets.  When we first started working together in April 2020, Curtin   University had a baseline diversion rate of 26%. By April 2023, diversion  was at 73%, exceeding our goal of 68%. In part, it can be attributed to  strong segregation and management of commingled recycling on site.  On top of delivering on Curtin University’s waste needs, we also  implemented initiatives to enhance service delivery. This included  embedding a Cleanaway team member on campus to offer direct  support, enrolling staff and students in our recycling e-learning  platform, Greenius, and running education and engagement programs. In 2021, we started targeting organics on campus as a key waste   stream to divert from landfill. We added organic bins in 90 kitchens  across campus to divert approximately 23.4 tonnes of organics from  landfill every year. Recovery of organics is not only key to reducing  methane gas from landfill but contributes to achieving our goal of   a circular economy for food waste.  It’s this collaborative and integrated work that placed us as a finalist   for the 2022 Government of Western Australia’s Waste Authority   ‘Waste Sorted Awards’. Today, Cleanaway continues to assist Curtin University with best practice  sustainable waste management, and through our strong partnership,  we are working to make a sustainable future possible together.  How Cleanaway revolutionised   waste management for Curtin University Page 58 Document position Planet Foreword Snapshot Introduction About us People Appendix Cleanaway Sustainability Report 2023 Prosperity Page 58 Case study  ===== PAGE 59 ===== During the year, our IWS business secured  significant contracts in the Oil and Gas sector  with ExxonMobil and Santos.  The ExxonMobil contract was to undertake decommissioning tank  cleaning work at ExxonMobil’s Altona plant. The Santos contract  spans WA, NT, QLD and SA showcasing IWS national capability   with support from Cleanaway’s Solids and Liquids business units.   In addition, Cleanaway successfully tendered for a Snowy 2.0 contract  for industrial and liquid waste services with further opportunity to  extend the contract in the future. Furthermore, a significant opportunity is related to decommissioning  ageing Oil and Gas assets. Much of Australia’s onshore and offshore  Oil and Gas infrastructure is approaching the end of its productive  life, leading to a significant forecast ramp-up in decommissioning  activity through the next decade and beyond. We are delivering on our strategy to increase our participation   in the Oil and Gas sector with these significant contract wins,   and with further exciting opportunities in the pipeline, we are  well-placed to participate in the decommissioning growth in   that sector while we continue organically growing our significant  mining market share.

It’s why we need to be proactive  with community impact management. To ensure government, regulators, local residents  and businesses are properly involved and informed about our facilities and operations,   we follow a consistent and robust community engagement approach:  In order to create a better tomorrow for the communities  in which we live and work, we need to wholly understand  how our operations impact these communities. That’s why  protecting the safety and wellbeing of people and the  environment is a foundation of Blueprint 2030.  Cleanaway operates across Australia and our vehicles  drive through almost every street, suburb and town.  We provide essential services for Australian households  and businesses while contributing economically to those  communities. Sometimes our operations can negatively  impact communities through noise, smell, busy roads and  safety risks such as fire and traffic accidents.  Communication and feedback Our stakeholders can teach us a  lot about our sites and help us  to ensure we’re designing waste  management solutions that  have the best outcomes for our  customers and the community.  We build and maintain strong  relationships with our varied  stakeholder groups to provide  transparent, timely information  about current activities and  future plans, while giving them  opportunities to voice any  queries or concerns. Education Experience shows that explaining  the beneficial role of a facility or  project in the context of waste  management, resource recovery  and environmental impact can  improve community sentiment  and willingness to engage with us.  ‘Design out’ impacts We work with independent  experts to identify which  operations may impact the  community or environment,  and design solutions to mitigate  these impacts. This is important  for giving confidence to our  community stakeholders that  we’re operating to the highest  environmental standards. Economic contribution For work that has the potential  to have a big impact, Cleanaway  considers how we can procure  locally. Increasing the community’s  understanding of how our projects  contribute to the local economy  through job creation and by  purchasing with local suppliers   can also help communities to  accept our work.

Greenius for Business helps educate  businesses about waste disposal for their  organisation and industry. This is a convenient  and cost-effective way to train employees  across different locations.     Greenius Online Learning We play an active role in educating  the community on the correct  recycling approach so that the  value of those waste streams can   be maximised. Cleanaway is actively involved   in supporting the communities  where we operate.  We work in partnership with the community to ensure  our contribution goes beyond the role of essential  service provider. Education, social procurement and  community donations are just some of the ways  we participate and make a difference. We aim to   make an impact through protecting the natural  environment, fostering positive attitudes towards  waste management, contributing to healthier  communities and championing road safety. We play an active role in educating the community  on the correct recycling approach so that the value  of those waste streams can be maximised. Any kind  of behaviour change requires education.

The resulting Recycling Behaviours Report represents an ongoing  commitment from the two partners to advance recycling education   and awareness in Australia, producing meaningful insights into  Australians’ recycling attitudes and behaviours. This year’s report continued to show the complex relationship consumers  have with recycling services. It highlighted that while most Australians  (90%) consider recycling important, more than one third of people   (38%) still find recycling confusing, an increase of 9% from 2021.  Crucially, the results indicated that many sustainable behaviours are   being driven by saving money, as the rising cost of living trumps climate  change as a concern for more than three quarters of respondents. The report provides us with meaningful insights into  people’s behaviours and motivations regarding recycling.  It is a powerful tool for generating conversation with  mainstream audiences, government stakeholders  and industry partners about the role of recycling and  sustainability in Australia. It also enables us to deliver  empowering education that builds consumers knowledge  of the recycling system, so that we can maximise the  amount of valuable resources recovered, and minimise  waste sent to landfill. Our aim is also to help drive policy  and positive behaviour change to help move our society  towards a more circular economy.

Together, we are focused on promoting the circular economy,  improving the rate of organics services across Australia, reducing  single-use plastic and advocating the benefits of container  deposit schemes. Clean Up Australia’s involvement in promoting  Cleanaway’s annual Recycling Behaviours Report is an example  of how we work together to promote recycling and sustainable  behaviours.  Clean Up Australia is a great match for Cleanaway and has  made for an enduring partnership. Across our business, our  people are passionate about helping to promote environmental  sustainability and Clean Up Australia’s grassroots approach  inspires, educates and empowers us to move towards a circular  economy. They are also a trusted advisor to governments at all  levels and businesses which means we can work together to  advocate for better sustainability outcomes. We look forward   to continuing to realise our shared goals in 2024.

This means  investing in a range of resource recovery and circularity solutions  to avoid waste which can’t be recycled, maximise landfill diversion,  investing in world-leading technology to generate energy from  residual waste. With landfill airspace diminishing and customers  demanding more diversion options, Energy from Waste (EfW)  facilities are a good way forward. While the technology and emissions management systems being  proposed are tried and tested internationally, Cleanaway recognises  EfW is a new solution in Australia and we’re committed to ensuring  local governments and communities are part of this journey. In FY23, we progressed planning approval for two significant   EfW projects, one in Victoria and one in Queensland. These projects  would be developed subject to approvals and supportive market  conditions. The timing for transition to EfW is also likely to vary  between states. Leveraging our extensive experience in complex  infrastructure solutions, vertical integration, and our access to  feedstock through strong customer relationships, Cleanaway  remains well-positioned to lead the market in Australia’s east coast. For more information, please visit:     Melbourne Energy and Resource Centre Blueprint 2030 pillar ‘Strategic  infrastructure growth’ focuses on  growing Cleanaway’s core business   by extending and integrating our  leading network of infrastructure   assets to deliver on our customer   value proposition of sustainability,  service and value for money. With the right infrastructure in the  right locations, we can drive further  network efficiency and margin  growth while ensuring our operations  are connected to the best resource  recovery solutions.  Page 64 Document position Planet Foreword Snapshot Introduction About us People Appendix Cleanaway Sustainability Report 2023 Prosperity Page 64 Strategic  infrastructure  ===== PAGE 65 ===== Scaling up FOGO processing with   Global Renewables Holdings (GRL)  Cleanaway is transitioning its GRL alternative waste treatment facility  at Eastern Creek, NSW into the largest Food Organics Garden Organics  (FOGO) processing facility in Australia. This will fill the sizable gap in  Australia’s FOGO market capacity. Our investment in Australia's FOGO  processing infrastructure will support councils and residents ahead of  national targets to collect this waste stream from every household by  2030. We are strategically positioned to capitalise on this emerging  opportunity in line with our Blueprint 2030 strategy and circularity goals.  The Cleanaway team at GRL has nearly two decades of experience with  producing organic products for soil amendment and will be using this  expertise to ensure Sydney’s FOGO is processed into high-value products  that contribute to the circular economy.  We conducted successful trials at the facility in December 2022 that  validated our ability to process kerbside FOGO material into an Australian  Standard compost product. The site continues to be upgraded in line with  an expected increase in FOGO volumes over the coming years.  The upgraded GRL facility will also help us deliver higher landfill diversion  and better carbon outcomes than red bin waste sent directly to landfill.  The diversion of FOGO from landfill is a crucial component of creating  more sustainable resource recovery, as organic waste trapped in landfill  releases methane, a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming.

Recently, we have made substantial investment by acquiring new  autoclaves. These highly pressurised processing vessels employ   a combination of moisture and heat to sterilise clinical and related  waste. The efficient decontamination process is an essential  component of our healthcare services, and the incorporation   of autoclave technology enables us to significantly enhance our  customer support capabilities through increased capacity, efficiency,  and safety.  This strategic investment follows a significant fire incident that  took place at our facility in Dandenong towards the end of FY22.  In response, we have successfully introduced two new autoclaves  within the facility. These installations not only introduce improved  methods for medical waste treatment but also reduce the risks  linked to potential future fire incidences.  Complementing our existing autoclave facilities at our Silverwater  facility, autoclave technology has also been installed at our Yatala  health facility.This initiative enables streamlined processing and  elevated safety standards for our Health Services business.

Our work to manage modern slavery  risks supports our commitment to respect human rights,  in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and  Human Rights (“UNGPs”). This means, avoiding infringing  on the human rights of others and addressing adverse  human rights impacts where we may be involved. During FY23, we engaged a specialist firm to undertake a  gap analysis and identify opportunities to further enhance  Cleanaway’s modern slavery risk management approach.  Key recommendations were incorporated into our existing  modern slavery workplan.  We enhanced our compliance framework by revising  our Supplier Code of Conduct, to support and reiterate  our commitment to respecting the human rights of our  employees and those who work with and for us. Refer to the 2023 Cleanaway Modern Slavery Statement  for more information:     Cleanaway Modern Slavery Statement Actions undertaken   in FY23 include: Completing desktop audits of over   150 global higher-risk suppliers. Undertaking three in-person independent  audits of higher-risk suppliers, including  one international supplier. Strengthening our Supplier Code of  Conduct by developing specific criteria  related to labour rights issues that clearly  prohibit the use of modern slavery. Developing a library of tiered modern  slavery clauses based on risk to be  added to central procurement contract  templates in FY24.

Particularly, we’ve provided  expert advice and guidance to policymakers and regulators in support of  the Federal Government’s climate ambition of net zero emissions by 2050.  We provided a submission to the Independent Review of Australian  Carbon Credit Units (ACCU). The review was set up to maintain   confidence in the ACCU scheme and the carbon crediting framework.  Cleanaway representatives also provided direct consultation to the   review panel.  Cleanaway is a member of a Landfill Gas Technical Working Group   which examines robust science-based calculations of methane   emissions from landfills.  In FY24, we will be working with the Department of Climate Change,  Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) to review our treatment  of landfills in terms of the ‘Safeguard Mechanism’, which is a policy for  reducing emissions at Australia’s largest industrial facilities. This follows   on from our contribution to the government Safeguard Mechanism  Reform process. DCCEEW are currently working to improve how landfill gas emissions  are reported in Australia. We’ve been working closely with DCCEEW  throughout FY23 to improve existing reporting and will continue this  relationship into FY24 as we define a robust, science-based method to  capture landfill emissions accurately.   We remain committed to ensuring our reporting aligns with relevant  Emissions and Energy Reporting Systems, such as ACCUs, Safeguard, and  National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER). It’s how we play  an active role in helping Australia to meet its greenhouse gas emission  targets with credibility. In playing our part in society to a more sustainable future,  Cleanaway advocates for our industry, government and  community to work together to create the conditions   for better waste management.

This is a fascinating industry that touches everyone’s lives and I’m  immensely proud to be part of it. Each and every day, our drivers,  operators and support staff work tirelessly to manage the stuff  that we collectively discard.   Paradoxically, as a society, we are all part of the problem, and  equally, all part of the solution.   On one level, the essential service that Cleanaway provides  enables businesses to operate and keeps our communities and the  environment safe. But it also represents extraordinary potential to  do something more with the resources that our society discards.   We have come a long way in the past few years, and we have   a long way to go.  Waste resources pose profound moral, technical, and regulatory  questions. Whilst there is a significant opportunity to create  circular solutions for waste, there are also hurdles that we need   to overcome, some directly in our control and many not.   As an industry, we need to figure out how to deal with  contamination in waste, with product design that prevents   or complicates recovery, with a patchwork of local government  recycling requirements, and the myriad of messages leading to  widespread confusion in our communities.   How can government help create end markets by, for instance,  mandating recovery for construction and demolition, or recycled  content in packaging? What greater role can others in the value  chain, from the finance industry to consumers, play?  These challenges contain enormous opportunities for those who  are prepared to work together, share the successes and failures   of innovation and take measured risks.  I am looking forward to seeing the progress we make in the  coming years as an industry and a community, as we work to   make a sustainable future possible together. Richard Pittard  Head of Sustainability Making a sustainable future possible together.  At Cleanaway, sustainability is at the core of what we do.  Our aspiration is to be Australia’s most innovative and  sustainable waste management and resource recovery  company, and a leader in the domestic circular economy.

Australian Auditing Standards, hereafter  referred to as a ‘review’, over the Subject Matter defined below  for the year ended 30 June 2023. Based on the procedures we have  performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come  to our attention that causes us to believe the Subject Matter has not  been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria  defined below. What our review covered We reviewed the following Subject Matter:  Cleanaway’s reported performance of its selected sustainability  performance data (‘Subject Matter’) as included in Cleanaway’s 2023  Sustainability Report and ESG databook (‘the Report’).  We reviewed a selection of sustainability disclosures (‘Selected  Disclosures’), as shown in the table to the right.  Criteria applied by Cleanaway In preparing the Selected Disclosures, Cleanaway applied the following  Criteria:  •	 Cleanaway’s own custom criteria, as defined throughout the   Report and the Basis of Preparation within the ESG databook   and informed by SASB Waste Management Standard •	 In preparing Selected Disclosures (Climate change), Cleanaway   applied its own custom criteria, informed by the Greenhouse Gas   (GHG) protocol and National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting  Regulations 2008 (“NGER Regulations”)    Selected Disclosures Report page Total gross Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions (kt CO2-e) 15, 45 Total gross Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions (kt CO2-e) 15, 45 Net Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions (kt CO2-e) 15, 45 Total landfill gas captured (PJ) ESG Databook Total landfill gas captured (Mm3) 15 Landfill gas – % flared ESG Databook Landfill gas – % used for generation by Cleanaway ESG Databook Landfill gas – % sent to 3rd parties ESG Databook Renewable energy generated from landfill (GWh) 15 Number of Direction notices received 38 Number of infringement notices received 38 Value of infringement notices received ($AUD) 38 Number of Recordable Injuries 19 Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) 11, 19 Percentage (%) of females at the CEO+1 level 12, 29 Percentage (%) of females at the CEO+2 level 12, 29 Turnover, broken down by: •	 Total turnover •	 Male turnover •	 Female turnover ESG Databook Waste incinerated (t) ESG Databook Total waste recycled through the NSW, QLD, WA and SA   Container Deposit Scheme (kt) 14 Oil recovered (ML) 14 Oil used by hydrocarbon division as input into WTE (kL) ESG Databook Paper and cardboard recycled (kt) 14 Plastic recycled (kt) 14 Climate change Safety Fines People Resource recovery Independent Limited Assurance Report to the Management  and Directors of Cleanaway Waste Management Limited  Page 79 Appendix Cleanaway Sustainability Report 2023 Document position Prosperity Snapshot People Planet About us Foreword Introduction Appendix Assurance  statement ix 1 A member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited   Liability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation  ===== PAGE 80 ===== Key responsibilities  EY’s responsibility and independence Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Subject Matter  based on our review. We have complied with the independence and  relevant ethical requirements, which are founded on fundamental  principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care,  confidentiality and professional behaviour.  The firm applies Auditing Standard ASQM 1 Quality Management for Firms  that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Reports and Other Financial  Information, or Other Assurance or Related Services Engagements, which  requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality  management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with  ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and  regulatory requirements. Cleanaway’s responsibility  Cleanaway’s management is responsible for selecting the Criteria, and for  presenting the selected disclosures in accordance with that Criteria, in all  material respects. This responsibility includes establishing and maintaining  internal controls, maintaining adequate records and making estimates  that are relevant to the preparation of the subject matter, such that it is  free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Our approach to conducting the review We conducted this review in accordance with the Australian Auditing  and Assurance Standards Board’s Australian Standard on Assurance  Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial  Information (‘ASAE 3000’) and the terms of reference for this engagement  as agreed with Cleanaway on 19 May 2023. That standard requires that  we plan and perform our engagement to express a conclusion on whether  anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the  Subject Matter is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with  the Criteria, and to issue a report. Summary of review procedures performed  A review consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for  preparing the Selected Disclosures and related information and applying  analytical and other review procedures.  The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected depend on our  judgement, including an assessment of the risk of material misstatement,  whether due to fraud or error. The procedures we performed included,  but were not limited to: •	 Conducted interviews with personnel to understand the business and  reporting process •	 Conducted interviews with key personnel, including data owners and  data providers, to understand Cleanaway’s process for collecting,  collating, and reporting the Selected Disclosures during the reporting  period  •	 Evaluated the suitability of the Criteria and checked it has been  appropriately applied in preparing the Selected Disclosures •	 Undertook analytical review procedures to support the reasonableness  of the data •	 Identified and tested assumptions supporting calculations  •	 Tested on a sample basis, underlying source information to assess the  accuracy of the data  •	 Assessed the adequacy and appropriateness of the presentation  relating to the Selected Disclosures, and whether the disclosed  information is consistent with our understanding of management and  performance at Cleanaway. We also performed such other procedures as we considered necessary in  the circumstances. We believe that the evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to  provide a basis for our review conclusion.

Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a review engagement  is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained  had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. Our procedures  were designed to obtain a limited level of assurance on which to base our  conclusion and do not provide all the evidence that would be required to  provide a reasonable level of assurance.  While we considered the effectiveness of management’s internal controls  when determining the nature and extent of our procedures, our assurance  engagement was not designed to provide assurance on internal controls.  Our procedures did not include testing controls or performing procedures  relating to assessing aggregation or calculation of data within IT systems. The GHG quantification process is subject to scientific uncertainty, which  arises because of incomplete scientific knowledge about the measurement  of GHGs. Additionally, GHG procedures are subject to estimation and  measurement uncertainty resulting from the measurement and calculation  processes used to quantify emissions within the bounds of existing  scientific knowledge. Other matters We have not performed assurance procedures in respect of any  information relating to prior reporting periods, including those presented  in the Subject Matter. Our report does not extend to any disclosures or  assertions made by Cleanaway relating to future performance plans and/ or strategies disclosed in Cleanaway’s 2023 Sustainability Report.    Use of our Assurance Report We disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this  assurance report to any persons other than management and the Directors  of Cleanaway or for any purpose other than that for which it was  prepared. Our review included web-based information that was available via web  links as of the date of this statement. We provide no assurance over  changes to the content of this web-based information after the date of  this assurance statement.

Given  the importance of reflecting current and  emerging trends, we undertook a full  materiality assessment in 2023, engaging  with a wide range of internal and external  stakeholders.    Throughout the assessment process,   we considered evolving global  Environmental, Social and Governance  (ESG) trends and the alignment with   our Blueprint 2030 strategy.   While reaffirming the significance of  our material topics, the outcomes of  the assessment also prompted certain  adjustments aimed at simplification   and reprioritisation of material topics.   These topics are systematically linked  to our ESG pillars: People, Planet and  Prosperity.   Subsequently, we developed a refreshed  materiality matrix to visually illustrate  the relative significance of these topics  for Cleanaway and our stakeholders.  The size of the bubble within the matrix  corresponds to the potential impact of the  respective topic on people, the planet,   and prosperity.

It means our stakeholders interests are protected through effective  oversight, risk management and transparency.   Governance of sustainability and climate matters are overseen by the  Board Sustainability Committee, with responsibility for management  of climate-related issues and the implementation of the associated  strategy delegated to our CEO.   The Head of Sustainability and Head of Carbon both report to  the Executive General Manager, Strategy, Sustainability, Mergers  and Acquisitions (who reports to the CEO) to ensure strategy,  sustainability and climate-related matters are linked.   The Sustainability Committee assists the Board in its oversight of  strategies, systems, policies, and practices in relation to four key areas:  workplace health and safety, environment, sustainability (inclusive of  climate and carbon), and quality.   The Committee oversees the implementation across the organisation,  including ensuring appropriate performance measures and targets are  in place in relation to Cleanaway’s sustainability initiatives.   It has primary responsibility for the assessment of climate-related risks  and opportunities and reports these matters directly to the Board.  The Committee also reviews key disclosures including Cleanaway’s  Sustainability Report, climate change disclosures, environmental and  health and safety compliance, and our Modern Slavery statement.   Our Board Audit and Risk Committee is responsible for the risk  management framework; in particular ensuring that sustainability   and climate-related risks are assessed and managed under our  enterprise-wide risk management framework.  Prosperity Foreword Cleanaway Sustainability Report 2023 Page 83 Introduction About us Appendix Document position Planet Snapshot People Appendix 2 Appendix  ===== PAGE 84 ===== Governance and transparency Corporate Structure    Cleanaway believes that high standards of corporate governance are   key to delivering on its mission and are critical to the achievement  of business objectives and, in turn, the creation and protection of  shareholders’ interests, through effective oversight, risk management   and transparency. Board structure and composition    Our Board comprises four male and three female Independent   Non-Executive Directors and our CEO. We select our Board members   based on the wide-ranging skills and perspectives that they can   contribute to guiding our business strategy and activities.   In considering the selection, appointment and re-election of Directors,  Cleanaway’s Board will maintain an appropriate balance of skills,  experience, expertise and diversity. Cleanaway’s Board carefully considers  the character, experience, education and skill set, as well as interests and  associations, of each potential candidate for appointment to the Board  and conducts appropriate checks to verify the suitability of the candidate  prior to their appointment as a Director.  For example, some of our current board members have worked  with entities closely linked with climate-related issues, such as the  Australian Renewable Energy Agency and Hydro Tasmania. Others  have worked in executive sustainability roles which have also required  an understanding of climate-related issues. Such experience brings a  valuable, multi-layered understanding of climate issues.  For more information on Corporate Governance, follow the link:    Corporate Governance Statement Risk & Compliance   The Board of Directors and Executive Management of Cleanaway are  committed to the establishment of a sound system of risk oversight,  management, and internal control. The Board has adopted an Enterprise  Risk Management Policy that sets out Cleanaway’s commitment to  proactive enterprise risk management and compliance. The policy is  supplemented by an Enterprise Risk Management Methodology that seeks  to embed risk management processes into Cleanaway’s business activities  Our growth and success depend on our ability to understand and  respond to the challenges of an uncertain and changing world. This  uncertainty generates risk, with the potential to be a source of both  opportunities and threats. By understanding and managing risk, we  provide greater certainty and confidence for all our shareholders.  Directors are encouraged and given the opportunity to broaden  their knowledge of the business and operations, and up-skill on  topics relevant to the company’s circumstances, by receiving regular  briefings and presentations from management, the Executive Team  and external parties in a range of fields, including emerging business  and governance issues relevant to the company (such as greenhouse  gas emissions, carbon reduction initiatives, sustainability and  cybersecurity), and material developments in laws and regulations.  We have a range of policies in place to ensure we meet our business  objectives through effective oversight, risk management and  transparency. Our Whistleblower Policy supports all employees  and stakeholders to raise concerns. We encourage all employees  and stakeholders to report any instances where our actions are  not aligned with our legal obligations, our policies or our Code of  Conduct. The Audit and Risk Committee oversees responses to reports  made through the independent whistleblower service, FairCall.  Prosperity Foreword Cleanaway Sustainability Report 2023 Page 84 Introduction About us Appendix Document position Planet Snapshot People Appendix 3 Appendix  ===== PAGE 85 ===== Cyber Security   The security of corporate and customer information is critical for  Cleanaway, with the protection of our network and data being key areas  of focus. Cleanaway has been investing in our cyber resilience over several  years.  Our data management procedures prioritise security and compliance.  In our continual commitment to robust cybersecurity management,  we implement careful practices to protect sensitive information.  Processes and policies exist to purge sensitive customer information  once used.  Certain personal identification documents such as heavy vehicle  drivers’ licences are required to be retained for Work Health and  Safety (WHS) and compliance requirements, this is limited to a specific  subset of employees, and we do not retain any personally identifiable  information from our customers.  Applicant data is retained in our tracking system for potential  future roles, but we only gather personally identifiable information  for successful applicants such as licences to operate machinery or  work rights validation. To enhance security, we have two-factor  authentication for publicly accessible systems and maintain a controls  to restrict internet access to necessary back-office systems and devices.  Bulk data exports are limited to users with privileged access, and  closely monitored for accountability. Access to personal information is  strictly limited to relevant roles, and we adhere to industry standards  such as OWSAP, NIST, AESCSF, ASD8 and PCI DSS.   Our commitment to security is evident through annual audits  conducted by EY for Financial Controls and Joint Ventures, as well  as cybersecurity assessments by Deloitte, in conjunction with annual  penetration testing to ensure maximum security.
