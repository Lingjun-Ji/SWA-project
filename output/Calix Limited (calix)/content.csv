The new plants are supporting the  expansion of sales into new regions,  including Wisconsin, Illinois and Texas,  as well as supporting new business  in the existing regions of the Pacific  Northwest and Upper Midwest. The  combination of the new facilities and  significant regulatory tailwinds continue  to position the business for growth.  Leilac & Heirloom signed global  licence and collaboration  agreements for Direct Air Capture  Leilac signed a binding and perpetual  global licence agreement and a  collaboration agreement with Direct Air  Capture (DAC) company, Heirloom, for  the exclusive use of Leilac's technology  by Heirloom for carbon dioxide  removal by DAC. Under the terms of  the agreement, Leilac will receive a  royalty based on the value of the CO2  captured with the technology. Carbon  dioxide removal in the order of 1 10  billion tonnes per annum is expected 1  to be needed to limit or return global  warming to 1.5°C, as committed to in  the Paris Agreement.  Sustainable lithium demonstration  plant with Pilbara Minerals passed  Final Investment Decision  A Mid-Stream Demonstration Plant  developed in a Unincorporated Joint  Venture between Calix and Pilbara  Minerals (ASX: PLS) passed its Final  Investment Decision. Supported  by $20m in Australian Government  funding, the plant at Pilbara Minerals  Pilgangoora operation will use Calixs  patented electric calcination technology  to demonstrate an innovative refining  process for sustainable lithium.  ZESTY produced green iron  from multiple Pilbara ores, and  first green iron briquettes  Calix concluded an expansive ore  testing program, including over  130 tests from nine different iron  ores. The results demonstrated  the production of green iron at  commercial grades, including for  low grade Australian hematite and  goethite ores. The green iron fines  produced by Zero Emissions Steel  TechnologY (ZESTY) were also  successfully processed into the  first ZESTY green iron briquettes  with highly encouraging properties,  demonstrating the potential to  produce a green Hot Briquetted Iron  (HBI) product for export.  Leilac-2 relocated to Heidelberg  Materials’ cement plant in Ennigerloh, Germany  Following Heidelberg Materials’ (FWB: HEI)  decision to end clinker production in  Hanover, Germany, Heidelberg Materials  cement plant in Ennigerloh, Germany was  selected as the new site for Leilac-2. With  the aim of demonstrating a replicable  module to efficiently capture up to  100,000 tonnes per year of unavoidable  process carbon dioxide emissions released  during cement and lime production,  Leilac-2 has delivered a robust detailed  design with construction expected to  commence promptly following permitting.  ZESTY study finds green iron solution with high  economic potential  With funding support from the Australian  Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), Calix  completed a Front-End Engineering and  Design (FEED) study for a 30,000 tonne  per annum ZESTY Hydrogen Direct  Reduced Iron (H2-DRI) demonstration  plant. The study found ZESTY can  produce near-zero emissions HBI from  low grade iron ore for close to existing,  carbon-intensive HBI processing costs 2 ,  before any benefit of emissions reduction  is accounted for.  1.

We are proud to  be using our unique mineral processing technology to create great businesses  and innovative solutions that help deliver a more sustainable future for societies,  industry and the planet. To this end, we are pleased to present the Calix Limited  Annual Report for the 2024 Financial Year (FY24).  FY24 was another challenging and turbulent year for financial markets, in particular  for equity markets associated with the Environment, Social and Governance (ESG)  investment thematic. Nonetheless, strong support for industrial decarbonisation  continues to grow.  Iron and steel perhaps best encapsulates the risks and opportunities of  decarbonisation for Australia. Australia produces over 50% of the world’s iron  ore 1, and iron ore dominates Australia’s export earnings 2 . Almost all Australian  ore, however, is of the hematite / goethite variety 3, considered low-grade and not  suitable for use in the electric arc furnaces that are expected to dominate the  future of steelmaking. Ensuring the compatibility of Australian iron ore with future  low-carbon steelmaking must therefore be a national priority.  With iron and steel being responsible for 8% of global CO2 emissions, or around  eight times the total emissions Australia produces domestically, decarbonisation  of this sector offers a meaningful opportunity beyond our borders. Furthermore,  turning iron ore into green iron can enable the capture of significantly more value  from Australia’s resources, not just protecting them from climate risks, but seizing  the economic opportunities that global decarbonisation readily presents.  Thankfully, Australia is abundant in both iron ore and renewable energy resources.  Combining government support, industry commitments and enabling technology  like Calix’s Zero Emissions Steel TechnologY (ZESTY) can help Australia seize the  opportunity to turn its iron ore into green iron.  Beyond iron ore, alumina, lithium and other critical minerals, as well as metals  such as magnesium, all require sustainable processing solutions compatible with  renewable energy sources. Given Australia’s comparative advantage in these  minerals, we believe the opportunity for Australia is clear.  The $22.7 billion “Future Made in Australia” package will back some of these  enormous opportunities with government support. The package includes measures  to drive down the cost of renewable energy and green hydrogen and a $1.7  billion “Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund” to support green metals and  low-carbon liquid fuels. This support is in addition to the Safeguard Mechanism,  National Reconstruction Fund, Powering the Regions Fund, Carbon Capture  Technologies Program and Critical Minerals Facility. A Carbon Border Adjustment  Mechanism (CBAM) is also under review.

Europe introduced a CBAM,  facilitating the gradual cessation of free  CO2 allowances for the European Union  (EU) Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) for  heavy industry. The EU ETS price bounced  from a low of €50  driven by a dip in  economic activity and the impacts of the  war in Ukraine  to finish the financial year  at €70. Longer term forecasts predict EU  ETS prices of around €200 by 2035 1 . The  free allowances will start to be phased out  in 2026, and by 2034, every tonne of CO2  emitted by industrial facilities in Europe, or  from goods imported into Europe, will be  exposed to, and liable for the prevailing EU  ETS price.  In the USA, bipartisan support for Carbon  Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS)  and Direct Air Capture (DAC) continues. Tax  incentives, introduced in 2008 by the Bush  administration and enhanced by the Biden  administration’s Inflation Reduction Act,  provide significant reward for the capture of  CO2 from industry and the atmosphere.  Leilacs DAC partner, Heirloom, had their  federal government funding for projects  in Louisiana enhanced by additional State  Government funding. Heirloom’s planned  facilities in Louisiana are part of Project  Cypress, supported by up to US$600m in  funding under the Bipartisan Infrastructure  Law. Heirloom will also receive up to  US$10m from the Republican Louisiana  State Government. Leilac and Heirloom  have signed an exclusive global licence  agreement for the use of the Leilac  technology in Heirloom’s DAC process, and  Leilac is already being paid to engineer two  projects, including one for Project Cypress.  In Asia, momentum for carbon accounting  and trading is emerging, with India, Malaysia,  Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and others  introducing regulatory frameworks for future  ETS launches.  Together, these policies speak volumes for  the strong support globally for industrial  decarbonisation and the technology  solutions that will achieve the necessary  change. The policies make evident the need  for urgent, cost-effective and scalable  solutions that balance social, economic  and environmental sustainability to solve  some of the greatest global challenges of  our time.  Focused delivery  Calix finished FY24 well positioned to  capitalise on these global tailwinds, having  focused on and delivered significant  milestones on the path to commercial  returns across all its lines of business.  In Calix’s Carbon Capture business, Leilac,  engineering revenues jumped from $0.1m in  FY23 to $3.2m in FY24, driven by advancing  its pipeline of opportunities into paid  studies and work. In the Magnesia business,  sales and services revenue increased  14% from FY23 to $21.0m, driven largely  by growth in the U.S. at increased gross  margin. And in the Sustainable Processing  business, continued on-time and on-budget  development of our Unincorporated Joint  Venture project with Pilbara Minerals  (ASX: PLS) is setting this business up for  its first major revenues.  This focused delivery is reflected in our  group financial results. In FY24, Calix  achieved a gross profit of $10.3m, up from  $6.2m in FY23, driven by a 30% increase in  products and services revenue to $24.2m.  Additionally, Calix realised a gain of $12.2m  in FY24 from its UJV with Pilbara Minerals.  This gain is a result of Calix’s free-carried  equity in the UJV's demonstration plant  and recognises the value of our intellectual  property contribution. Calix finished the  financial year with $43m cash on hand,  down just 10% from 31 December 2023,  despite continued investment in capability  and key project delivery.  It is pleasing to see growth and  diversification in our revenue streams,  especially in revenue contributions from the  Leilac business. This growth reflects growing  demand for paid engineering studies and  materials testing with our core technology,  underscoring both the technology’s  potential and the growing industrial push  to decarbonise, notwithstanding the  current market conditions. Importantly,  these new and growing revenue streams  provide great cash support as we develop  the technology prior to the commencement  of licensing royalties.  Throughout FY24, Calix continued its  planned investment in people, plant and  equipment, focused on the delivery of its  priority projects. These are the Mid-Stream  Demonstration Plant in a UJV with Pilbara  Minerals, scale up of ZESTY from pilot to  demonstration scale, the development of  a replicable and retrofittable module for  cement and lime decarbonisation with  Leilac-2, and DAC projects with Heirloom.  Whilst Calix’s platform technology can be  deployed in many directions, we continue to  employ considerable discipline as to where  we direct our capital, people and focus.  The determining factor is profitable growth.  We direct our attention to projects which  can launch new revenue streams, provide  material revenue uplift at attractive margins  and where we generate the best return for  allocating our capital.  Our investments in FY24 were  supplemented by $5.2m in grants and tax  rebates from governments in the various  countries in which we operate. In addition,  a grant from the Australian Government  supported the development of a new  electric calciner at Calix’s Technology Centre  that will increase the Company’s capacity  for technology development and material  testing for commercial, paid projects.  More commercial milestones  In addition to significantly growing and  diversifying our revenue streams, our  dedicated team has delivered significant  commercial progress against the Company’s  key milestones in FY24, including:  A signed JV agreement between Leilac  and Heidelberg Materials (FWB: HEI) for  Leilac-2;  The relocation of Leilac-2 to Heidelberg  Materials’ cement plant in Ennigerloh,  Germany;  Signed global licence and collaboration  agreements between Leilac and leading  U.S. DAC company, Heirloom;  The development of two DAC projects  with Heirloom in Louisiana, USA;  The start of construction of Calix’s  sustainable lithium demonstration plant  in UJV with Pilbara Minerals, following a  successful Final Investment Decision (FID)  and detailed design engineering;  The completion of pilot scale testing for  ZESTY, which produced green iron from  multiple ores, and the first green iron  briquettes; and  The completion of the ZESTY  demonstration plant Front-End  Engineering and Design (FEED) study,  which found ZESTY has the potential to  deliver an economical green iron solution,  even at demonstration scale and without  accounting for the price of carbon.

Other significant progress included:  Successful completion of a pre-FEED  study for Calix’s Zero Emissions Alumina  (ZEAL) technology;  Opening of new hydration facilities in  Wisconsin and Texas to boost our U.S.  Magnesia business capacity;  Completion of a study confirming Calix’s  bioactive magnesium oxide materials  provide quantifiable control of pathogenic  and drug-resistant bacteria; and  Commissioning of a new electric calciner  at the Calix Technology Centre to increase  the Company’s research and development,  and business development capabilities.  Further information on each of these  projects can be found in the FY24 highlights  and business updates contained in this  Annual Report, as well as within the new  investor centre on the Calix website.  Looking ahead  In FY25, we will prioritise completing  construction and commissioning of Calix's  sustainable lithium demonstration plant with  Pilbara Minerals, breaking ground on the  Leilac-2 plant in Ennigerloh, Germany with  Heidelberg Materials, and breaking ground  on the first commercial scale DAC facility  with Heirloom in the U.S. The successful  commissioning of these plants will pave the  way to our first licensing revenues from the  lithium, cement and DAC applications.  We also hope to pass the FID point for Calix’s  ZESTY demonstration plant. Following the  completion of our pilot-scale testing and  FEED study in FY24, we made significant  progress on establishing the location,  hydrogen supply, iron ore supply, green  iron offtake, and project finance required  for a ZESTY demonstration plant. FY25 will  see a continued and concerted effort to  progress a ZESTY demonstration plant to  FID and beyond.  Another priority in FY25 is our zero  emissions lime and cement demonstration  plant in South Australia. It is off to a great  start with the award of a $15m grant from  the Australian Government. This innovative  carbon capture and use project aims to  generate revenue through two products  zero emissions lime sold via our partners,  and captured CO2 for use by the Solar  Methanol 1 project to produce low-carbon  fuel for shipping.  As we work to deliver Calix’s key priority  projects and turn licence agreements into  royalty payments, we will also prioritise  revenue growth and diversification from  Calixs Magnesia business as well as paid  engineering studies. Our commercialisation  strategy is designed to provide flexible  funding options at a subsidiary and project  level to accelerate the technology’s  deployment in large addressable markets  and deliver commercial success as early  as possible.  Capital strategy  Calixs balance sheet, growing revenue  streams and cost management discipline  provide the cash support needed for  current operations and technology  development. Calix’s approach to couple  paid engineering studies with secured  grant funding is designed to support  first-of-a-kind commercial demonstration  of the technology in key markets prior to  first receipts of royalty revenues. Calix's  capital management and funding strategy  continues to focus on opportunities to  secure capital in the form of equity, debt  or grants at the subsidiary and project  level to fund projects and accelerate  industry application.  Our pathway to sustainability  As we work to help solve global  challenges, we are pleased to report  that Calix itself is also making progress  towards greater sustainability in our own  operations. With a commitment to three  key sustainability ambitions  science- based emission reduction in line with  the 1.5°C pathway, gender balance at all  levels of the organisation, and addressing  the sustainability of the materials and  resources we use in our business  we are  moving to better integrate Calix’s internal  sustainability initiatives with the Company’s  strategic priorities.  Leveraging the learnings from Calix’s  inaugural greenhouse gas assessment in  FY23, in FY24, we strengthened our data  collection to generate a more robust and  accurate assessment of emissions hotspots  in Calix’s operations and value chain. This  work is enabling us to more carefully target  our efforts to reduce emissions.  Calix continues as a participant of the  United Nations Global Compact (UNGC).  We are committed to embedding the Ten  Principles of the UNGC on human rights,  labour, environment and anti-corruption into  Calix’s operations.  This year, Calix’s Annual Report is being  published alongside our Sustainability  Report and a detailed Corporate  Governance Statement, another indication  of the maturing of our sustainability journey.  Good governance is critical to strong  sustainability performance. We remain  steadfast in our adherence to high  standards of corporate governance  and transparency. This commitment  supports the delivery of Calixs strategy,  while meeting prevailing best practice  governance standards.  The Board continues to take a proactive  approach to board succession and renewal,  ensuring the composition of the board  is appropriate at all times to support the  delivery of Calix’s strategic goals. To this  end, we announced the appointments of  Dr Sarah Ryan and Peter Dixon to the Board  as independent non-executive directors in  December 2023.  14  FY24 HIGHLIGHTS BUSINESS UPDATES SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT CALIX ANNUAL REPORT 2024                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  ’  ’  ’   ===== PAGE 17 ===== On behalf of the Board, we would like to  thank Calix’s employees for their tireless  efforts and unwavering commitment to  achieving our purpose and goals.

Leilac’s technology efficiently separates  unavoidable carbon emissions ready  for use or storage, without additional  chemicals or processes. It is designed to be  scalable, retrofittable, energy agnostic and  electrification ready, to provide flexible and  economical pathways to low-carbon cement  and lime.  Through the production of zero emissions  lime, Leilac also aims to support the  decarbonisation of other hard-to-abate  sectors, as well as removing carbon dioxide  from the atmosphere through Direct  Air Capture (DAC).  Operating across Europe, the Americas and  Asia Pacific, Leilac has imagined the future  for sustainable industry. And we’re creating  it. Today.  Market trends  In FY24, government policies and  regulation continued to support industrial  decarbonisation commitments around  the world.  In Europe, the introduction of a Carbon Border  Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) enabled the  European Union (EU) to announce the phasing  out of free allowances to its Emissions Trading  System (ETS). Hard-to-abate industries,  including cement and lime, will have their  free allowances reduced 48.5% by 2030  and 100% by 2034.  The European Commission released a  2040 Roadmap recommending 90%  CO2 reduction by 2040. To support this  target, an Industrial Carbon Management  Strategy outlined support for industrial  decarbonisation, including by carbon  capture, use and storage of industrial and  atmospheric carbon dioxide, building on the  Net-Zero Industry Act.  In the U.S., tax incentives for Carbon  Capture Use and Storage (CCUS) and DAC  continued to receive bipartisan support.  Tax credits under section 45Q of the U.S.  tax code provides US$85 per tonne of CO2  captured and permanently stored from  industry, and US$180 per tonne of CO2  removed from the atmosphere by DAC.  The development of Emissions Trading  Systems and carbon pricing continued to  grow momentum in the Asia Pacific, with  India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam  and other countries introducing regulatory  frameworks to support future ETS launches.  In Australia, the Safeguard Mechanism  requires large industrial facilities to reduce  their emissions in line with national targets  and puts a price on emissions beyond  this cap. The Australian Government’s  Carbon Capture Technologies Program is  also providing support for industrial CCUS  projects, particularly those focused on  cement and lime.  FY24 achievements  Leilac-2  The EU funded Leilac-2 project aims to  demonstrate a replicable and retrofittable  module capable of efficiently capturing up  to 100,000 tonnes per year of unavoidable  process carbon dioxide emissions released  during cement and lime production, while  operating on low-cost and lower carbon  alternative fuels. As such, it represents  an important demonstration and scale up  step to enable full-scale and industry-wide  deployment of the Leilac technology.  Following Heidelberg Materials’ (FWB:  HEI) decision to end clinker production in  Hanover, Germany, the Leilac-2 project  was successfully relocated to Heidelberg  Materials’ cement plant in Ennigerloh,  Germany 1. The rapid relocation of the  project was testament to the robust  and replicable technology design and  the commitment of the project team.  Construction of the Leilac-2 plant is  expected to commence in 2025 and  commissioning of the plant is expected to  occur in mid-2026.  Leilac and Heidelberg Materials also formed  a Joint Venture (JV) for the construction,  operation and future transfer of ownership  of the Leilac-2 demonstration plant  at Heidelberg Materials’ cement plant  in Ennigerloh, Germany 2. In parallel  with the construction of Leilac-2, both  companies have committed to exploring  the development of a full-scale commercial  installation. Heidelberg Materials and  Leilac have previously signed a global  licence agreement covering all plants  where the Leilac technology is used,  including Leilac-2 3.   ===== PAGE 19 ===== Commencing site works at Heidelberg Materials’ cement plant in  Ennigerloh, Germany for Leilac-2.

Carbon dioxide  removal in the order of 1-10 billion tonnes per annum is  expected to be needed to limit or return global warming to  1.5°C, as committed to in the Paris Agreement 1.  In October 2023, Leilac signed a binding and perpetual  global licence agreement and a collaboration agreement  with DAC company, Heirloom, for the exclusive use of Leilac's  technology by Heirloom for carbon dioxide removal by DAC 2.  Under the terms of the agreement, Leilac will receive a royalty  based on the value of the CO2 captured with the technology.  Electric and renewably powered versions of the Leilac  technology will first be installed at Heirloom’s DAC facilities in  Shreveport, Louisiana, USA. A first facility will aim to capture  ~17,000 tons 3 of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere per  year, with operations expected to commence by 2026. A  second co-located facility is Heirloom’s contribution to Project  Cypress, a U.S. Department of Energy-supported DAC Hub  eligible for up to US$600m in government funding under the  Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This second facility aims to  scale incrementally to capture ~300,000 tons 3 of CO2 from  the atmosphere each year, with the first 100,000 tons per  annum of capture capacity expected to come online in 2027.  Business growth  In FY24, Leilac’s team of industry experts and specialists grew  to 70. Located in 13 countries and speaking 25 languages,  Leilac has built a world-class team ready to support the global  deployment of the technology to cement, lime and DAC.  In FY24, Leilac focused on advancing its priority projects  and finished the financial year with 82 projects in its pipeline.  Advancing the pipeline of opportunities into paid studies  and work generated engineering revenues of $3.2m in FY24,  up from $0.1m in FY23.  –  –  –  –  ALIGNMENT WITH THE SUSTAINABLE  DEVELOPMENT GOALS  “Carbon Capture and Storage plays a major role in decarbonizing  the industry sector in the context of 1.5°C and 2°C pathways,  especially in industries with higher process emissions, such as  cement.” SR1.5. Chapter 2. IPCC. 2018.  Leilac is the collaborative technology partner seeking to enable a  sustainable future for cement and lime in a net-zero world. Our  potentially lowest cost carbon abatement solution aims to equip  producers to take urgent action against climate change and  protect their industries’ jobs and prosperity.  Like the Sustainable Development Goals (Global Goals), Calix  recognises the need to balance social, economic and environmental  sustainability.

Calixs patented core platform technology  uses indirect radiative heating to process  raw minerals into low carbon mineral  products. Efficient and precise electric  heating, fully compatible with renewable  energy sources, replaces inefficient  combustion of fossil fuels. Calix’s Zero  Emissions Steel TechnologY (ZESTY) pairs  electric heating with green hydrogen as a  reducing agent to replace coal and produce  green iron and steel.  Processing minerals at the mine site can  also offer a new paradigm in sustainable  mineral production, including enhanced  ore recovery, fewer processing steps,  zero-waste, rationalised supply chains, and  reduced transport costs.  Market trends  In Australia, the $22.7 billion Future Made in  Australia package 1 was introduced, targeting  priority industries such as green metals  that will have a comparative advantage as  the global economy transitions to net zero.  The package outlines support for renewable  energy, green hydrogen, critical minerals, and  the production of green metals such as iron  and aluminium, including a $1.7 billion Future  Made in Australia Innovation Fund to support  green metals and low-carbon liquid fuels.  This Australian Government support is  in addition to the Safeguard Mechanism,  $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund,  $1.9 billion Powering the Regions Fund, and  $4 billion Critical Minerals Facility. A Carbon  Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is  also under review.  Like cement, the iron and steel industry in  Europe will see its free allowances to the  European Union Emissions Trading Scheme  (EU ETS) phased out 48.5% by 2030 and  100% by 2034, following the introduction of  a CBAM.  In Asia Pacific, China is expected to add  cement, steel and alumina to its ETS, and  the China Certified Emission Reduction  voluntary carbon market is expected to be  restarted 2 . Prices are expected to remain  low before increasing, as emissions peak  closer to 2030.  ETS momentum is emerging across Asia  Pacific, with India, Malaysia, Indonesia,  Thailand, Vietnam and other countries  introducing regulatory frameworks for future  ETS launches.  FY24 achievements  Zero Emissions Steel TechnologY  Pilot-scale ZESTY trials using the electric  ‘BATMn’ calciner at the Calix Technology  Centre in Bacchus Marsh, Australia,  continued throughout much of FY24, with  over 130 tests from nine different Australian  iron ores completed.3  Most test runs at the targeted temperature  range achieved the level of metallisation  suitable for downstream use in either a  melter or blast furnace, while several tests  reached sufficient metallisation levels for  feed directly to an electric arc furnace.  Importantly, this included low-grade  hematite and goethite ores that account  for 96% of Australian iron ore exports 4 ,  or 50% of global iron ore supply 5 and are  not otherwise suited to use in an electric  arc furnace.  The ZESTY H2-DRI (Hydrogen Direct  Reduced Iron) fines have been successfully  processed into the first ZESTY green  iron briquettes with highly encouraging  properties, demonstrating the potential to  produce a green Hot Briquetted Iron (HBI)  product for export.  With funding support from the Australian  Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), Calix  completed a Front-End Engineering and  Design (FEED) study for a 30,000 tonne per  annum ZESTY green iron demonstration  plant 6 . The study found that even at  demonstration scale, ZESTY has the  potential to produce near-zero emissions  HBI from low grade iron ore for close to  the cost of existing, carbon-intensive HBI  processing costs 7, before any benefit of  emissions reduction is accounted for. A  Final Investment Decision on a ZESTY  HBI demonstration facility is being  progressed and is subject to plant location  and commercial agreements currently  under negotiation.

The UJV aims to develop an innovative ‘mid­ stream’ process that reduces the carbon  intensity, waste and cost associated with  lithium production, while also capturing  more value from the mineral resource.  A demonstration plant, with a full  production capacity of more than 3,000  tonnes per year of concentrated lithium- phosphate salt product from a feedstock  of around 27,000 tonnes per year of  spodumene – including lower grade  fine spodumene concentrate – made  significant progress in FY24. Following  a successful Final Investment Decision  (FID) 2, detailed design engineering and the  fabrication of key equipment preceded the  commencement of construction.  The demonstration plant is supported by  $20m in Australian Government funding  and remains on time and on budget, with  commissioning due to commence in the  March quarter 2025 and the first lithium  salt production by June quarter 2025. In  FY24, Calix recognised a gain of $12.2m that  resulted from its free-carried equity in the  UJV's demonstration plant.  1. Calix ASX Announcement.

Calix’s technology is energy agnostic  and electrification-ready, providing  sustainable and economical  pathways for industrial processes to  transition to clean energy sources,  including renewable electricity.  From electrification, to enabling  green steel through hydrogen  reduction, to reducing the waste  and CO2 footprint of mineral  processing with innovative  refining solutions, Calix is enabling  sustainable industrial processing.   ===== PAGE 22 ===== Business overview  Calixs magnesium-based products deliver  safe, sustainable and effective solutions for  global environmental challenges.  For water treatment, aquaculture and  wastewater management, Calix’s magnesium  hydroxide liquid products stabilise alkalinity  and reduce pollution of our water systems.  They provide a sustainable and cost- effective alternative to caustic soda.  The unique bioactive properties of Calixs  high surface area magnesium oxide  materials are also enabling the development  of novel solutions for crop protection in  agriculture, non-toxic marine coatings,  and non-lethal alternatives to biocides  and antibiotics for the prevention of  antimicrobial resistance.  Leveraging its platform technology for  sustainable mineral processing and capture  of unavoidable carbon dioxide emissions,  Calixs magnesia business is also developing  sustainable processing solutions for  magnesium metal, a critical mineral used in  lightweight metal alloys.  Market trends  The effective and sustainable treatment  of water is imperative to improved public  health outcomes, economic activity and  protecting natural ecosystems.  Increased regulation of nitrogen removal  in wastewater is creating support for  solutions that boost alkalinity and maintain  effective microorganism activity. For the  potable water market, strengthened  regulation on residual lead and copper  requires alternative pH control solutions to  minimise the corrosivity of water within the  distribution system.  In agriculture, reducing dependence on  lethal chemical pesticides continues to be  an important challenge. Existing chemicals  and pesticides are being deregistered,  or regulations around when and how  they can be used are becoming tighter.  This regulation follows recognition that  conventional pesticides are often toxic 1, can  persist and accumulate in the environment 2 ,  reduce biodiversity 3, and are becoming  less effective through the development of  target resistance 4 .  Antimicrobial resistance is now a rapidly  emerging global crisis following many years  of antibiotic overuse. It is projected to cost  the global economy US$100 trillion and  cause 10 million deaths per year by 2050 5 .  FY24 achievements  In FY24, the Magnesia business recorded  revenues of $21.0m and gross profit of $7.0m,  up 13.7% and 15.5% from FY23 respectively.  Water  IER, Calix’s water and wastewater treatment  subsidiary in the USA, boosted its capacity  with the opening of new hydration facilities  in Ripon, Wisconsin and Lufkin, Texas. The  new plants supported the expansion of sales  into new regions, including Wisconsin, Illinois  and Texas, as well as new business in the  existing regions of the Pacific Northwest  and Upper Midwest.  The demand for additional capacity follows  the development of ALKA-Mag+, a safe,  sustainable and cost-effective alternative  to caustic soda. In addition to the new  facilities, IER grew and strengthened its  team to support further business growth.

Leveraging its core platform technology and a global network of  partners, Calix is urgently developing multiple businesses that  deliver positive global impact.  Technology  Calix’s platform technology is a reinvention of the kiln process  with three core benefits:  Capture of unavoidable emissions: unavoidable process CO2  emissions from cement and lime production and CO2 from the  atmosphere are captured for use or storage.  Electrification and renewable energy-ready: compatible with  electricity and alternative fuels to provide viable, flexible and  economical pathways to sustainable processing.  Highly-active materials: produces high purity / active materials  with enhanced chemical and/or bioactivity.  Operations  The Group has operations, customers and distribution partners  across Australia, New Zealand, Asia, Europe and the United States  of America (“US”). Its activities in the 2024 Financial Year (“FY24”)  were focused across three business segments, being: Leilac  (CO2 mitigation), Sustainable Processing, and Magnesia. These  “lines of business” are supported by Research & Development  (“R&D”), engineering, operations, marketing, and finance and  administration teams.  Our business activities are underpinned by:  A commercial-scale operations facility – the Calix Technology  Centre – at Bacchus Marsh in Victoria, Australia with a  name-plate capacity of 25,000 tonnes per year of raw  (magnesium oxide) product;  A raw material (magnesium carbonate) mine near Leigh Creek  in South Australia;  A pilot demonstration facility for CO2 capture from lime and  cement (“Leilac-1” facility) in Lixhe, Belgium;  Two electric calciners for sustainable processing development  and the production of advanced materials at the Calix  Technology Centre; and  Six manufacturing facilities in the U.S. to produce water  treatment products to serve North American customers.  Operating results  In FY24, product revenues increased by 30% to $24.2m (FY23: $18.6m),  with gross margin growing to 43% (FY23: 33%) from the Magnesia  and Leilac lines of business. In FY24, Calix materially grew  the revenue stream associated with performing engineering  services in support of Leilac’s customers, contributing $3.2m.  Calix also realised a gain of $12.2m that resulted from Calix’s  free-carried equity in its unincorporated joint venture with  Pilbara Minerals (ASX: PLS).  The Company incurred expenditure of $41.9m (FY23: $31.7m) in  capability and capacity building to commercialise Calix’s platform  technology, particularly in the Leilac and Sustainable Processing  lines of business. This includes investment in additional research,  development and engineering, which accounted for 67% of the  total increase in operational expenditure. Calix concluded FY24  with 155 full-time employees (FY23: 123 full-time employees),  which includes 20 new engineers and scientists to support our  technology commercialisation, as well as new employees to  support customer projects.  Financial position  The Group held $43.0m in cash and cash equivalents at  30 June 2024 (30 June 2023: $74.5m) and had a surplus of  $27.0m of total current assets over total current liabilities  (30 June 2023: $68.2m). Calix’s strong balance sheet, including  its cash position and minimal debt, provides the capacity to  simultaneously pursue commercialisation opportunities in large  addressable markets across the Company’s lines of business.  Market conditions  Despite an otherwise challenging macroeconomic environment,  commitment to and investment in solutions that align with  Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) goals continues  to grow year-on-year as governments, industries and investors  look to achieve their decarbonisation goals and meet their  net-zero commitments.  In FY24, further policies to drive decarbonisation were  announced around the world, including:  Europe  Free allowances for the European Union Emissions Trading  Scheme (ETS) will be progressively phased out following the  introduction of a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).  Free allowances, including for cement, lime and steel producers,  will reduce 48.5% by 2030 and 100% by 2034.  The European Commission released a 2040 Roadmap  recommending a 90% CO2 reduction by 2040.  The European Commission published an Industrial Carbon  Management Strategy that outlined support for industrial  decarbonisation, including by carbon capture, use and storage  of industrial and atmospheric carbon dioxide.

It underpins investment in Carbon Capture Use and  Storage and Direct Air Capture.  Project Cypress, a DAC hub in which Heirloom is one of two DAC  firms, was selected by the U.S. Department of Energy for up to  US$600 million in funding through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.  Asia Pacific  China is expected to add cement, steel and alumina to its ETS,  and the China Certified Emission Reduction (CCER) voluntary  carbon market is expected to be restarted. Prices are expected  to remain low before increasing as emissions peak closer to 2030.  ETS momentum is emerging across Asia Pacific, with Malaysia,  Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and other countries introducing  regulatory frameworks for future ETS launches.  India introduced the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS)  as a framework for an ETS launch.  In addition to the Safeguard Mechanism, Powering the Regions  Fund, National Reconstruction Fund, Critical Minerals Strategy  in Australia, and the Carbon Capture Technologies Program,  the Australian Government launched the Future Made in  Australia policy to maximise the economic and industrial  benefits of the energy transition. A CBAM is also under review.  These policies recognise the need for urgent, affordable and scalable  solutions that balance social, economic and environmental sustainability  to solve some of the greatest global challenges of our time.  Going concern  The financial report has been prepared on a going concern basis.  Significant changes in the state of affairs  There were no significant changes in the state of affairs of the  Group during the year.  Dividends  No dividends were paid or were payable during the year (2023: $NIL).  After balance date events  On 23 July 2024, Calix announced it had been awarded a $15  million grant from the Australian Government’s Carbon Capture  Technologies Program. The grant will support the construction  of a world-first renewably powered carbon capture and use  demonstration plant in South Australia to produce near zero  emissions lime and supply captured industrial CO2 emissions to  the HyGATE funded Solar Methanol 1 project (“SM1”). Further  information is available on Calix’s website in its investor centre  and the ASX market announcements platform.  No other matters or circumstances have arisen since the end of  the financial year which significantly affected, or may significantly  affect, the operations of the Group, the results of those  operations, or the state of affairs of the Group in future years.  Environmental regulation  The Group’s operations are subject to local, state and federal  environmental legislation and regulations in both the testing and  operational areas. The Calix Limited Board of Directors (“Board”)  is responsible for regular monitoring of environmental exposure  and compliance with environmental regulations and is not aware  of any breaches of these regulations during the year. The Group is  committed to achieving a high standard of environmental performance.  Indemnification and insurance of officers  During the financial year, the Company paid a premium to insure  the directors, officers and senior managers against certain  liabilities that may be incurred whilst they perform their duties  for the Company. This may include liabilities and costs associated  with defending civil or criminal proceedings brought against the  individuals in their capacity as officers of the entities in the Group.  Options, warrants and rights  At the date of this report, there were no unissued ordinary shares  of the Company under option, no warrants on issue and 5,739,820  share options on issue. Refer to Note 20 of the financial statements  for further details of the share options outstanding at balance date.  The details of options, warrants and rights issued to Key Management  Personnel as remuneration are set out in the Remuneration Report.  Proceedings on behalf of the company  No person has applied to the Court under section 237 of the  Corporations Act 2001 for leave to bring proceedings on behalf  of the Group or intervene in any proceedings to which the Group  is a party, for the purpose of taking responsibility on behalf of  the Group for all or any part of those proceedings.  Auditor  KPMG was appointed Auditor on 15 January 2024, following  a vote taken at the Companys Annual General Meeting held  on 16 November 2023 and ASICs consent to the resignation  of BDO Audit Pty Ltd in accordance with section 327 of the  Corporations Act 2001.  Non-audit services  The Group may decide to employ the auditor on assignments  additional to their statutory audit duties where the auditor’s expertise  and experience with the Company and/or Group are important.  The Group has not paid any amounts nor had any amounts  payable to the auditors for non-audit services during FY24.  In the prior year, when BDO Audit Pty Ltd acted as auditor,  the Group paid $29,348 to BDO for tax consulting services.  The Company’s Board would consider the provision of the  non-audit services by the auditor as to whether those services  are compatible with the general standard of independence  for auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001. Directors  were satisfied that the provision of non-audit services by the  auditors, as set out above, did not compromise the auditor  independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001  for the following reasons:  All non-audit services had been reviewed by the directors  to ensure they do not impair the impartiality and objectivity  of the audit; and  None of the services undermine the general principles relating  to auditor independence as set out in APES 110 Code of Ethics  for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards).  Auditor independence  A copy of the auditors independence declaration as required under  section 307c of the Corporations Act 2001 is set out on page 44.  Rounding off  The Group is of a kind referred to in ASIC Corporations (Rounding  in Financial/Directors’ Reports) instrument 2016/191 and in  accordance with that instrument, amounts in the consolidated  financial statements and directors’ report have been rounded off  to the nearest thousand dollars unless otherwise stated.

Further details on this year’s remuneration  outcomes, including the Companys KPI Dashboard, are provided in  this report.  Proposed new remuneration framework  The Board is committed to ensuring Calix’s remuneration  framework and the associated reward outcomes continue to  align with the Company’s business objectives, performance and  shareholder expectations.  Our approach to developing our remuneration framework is  designed to ensure we remain competitive in the global market,  attracting and retaining top talent despite our relatively smaller  size. By benchmarking our compensation packages against  industry standards, we aim to offer fair and attractive salaries  that reflect the value and expertise our employees bring to the  Company operating with a global footprint.  Accordingly, the People, Culture and Nominations Committee  engaged an external remuneration consultant to assist with the  design of a new framework to be implemented for FY25 and  beyond, but not for the FY24 period. The Board, based on advice  and recommendations provided by the external remuneration  consultant, has determined that a new remuneration framework  be adopted for the FY25 year and future years. The framework is a  more typical structure applied by listed companies. The framework  comprises a short-term and long-term performance component  that can be earned by KMP and senior executives, in addition  to fixed pay.  The following principles are being incorporated into the new framework:  Alignment of employees’ interests with Company strategies and  shareholders’ interests;  Enhanced alignment of the new framework with market practice;  Flexibility to allow adjustments based on market demand and  future growth;  Simplicity and transparency to ensure the new framework can  be easily explained and understood by stakeholders;  Features to attract, retain and motivate executives; and  Features to fairly and adequately reward individual and collective  high performance.  The details of the proposed new remuneration framework will be  outlined in the Notice of Meeting for Calix’s 2024 Annual General  Meeting (AGM).  I invite you to read our FY24 Remuneration Report to understand  how Calix is building alignment of employees’ interests with  shareholders’ interests to deliver long term shareholder value.  On behalf of the Company’s Directors, we look forward to  welcoming you and receiving your feedback at our 2024 AGM.  Peter Dixon  Chair  People, Culture and Nominations Committee  Dear Shareholders  On behalf of the Board of Directors of Calix Limited (the Board),  I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report for the year  ended 30 June 2024 (FY24).  It is a privilege to have been appointed Chair of the People, Culture  and Nominations Committee. I would like to take this opportunity  to recognise and thank Peter Turnbull for his dedication over the  past 15 years as a Non-Executive Director, ten years as Chair of  the Board, and the past ten years as Chair of the People, Culture  and Nominations Committee.  The Remuneration Report sets out the remuneration information  for directors of Calix Limited and its controlled entities, and  other Key Management Personnel (KMP), as well as providing a  summary of performance outcomes for FY24 and their associated  remuneration outcomes.  The key objectives of Calix’s remuneration policies are to align  Calix’s directors and employees, including KMP, with shareholders’  interests, while ensuring remuneration structures are fair and  competitive. The policies seek to balance incentives to achieve  annual short-term goals with incentives to create and execute  opportunities that build long-term shareholder value.  FY24 performance and reward outcomes  The Board is satisfied that the reward outcomes for FY24 reflect  the Company’s performance.  In FY24, Calix maintained a strong balance sheet, as well as  diversifying and growing its revenue. The expansion of Calix’s U.S.  Water business saw an increase in sales revenue and gross margin,  while Leilac and the Sustainable Processing lines of business  brought in new revenue streams.  In FY24, a focus on key projects delivered substantial milestones.  Calix’s sustainable lithium demonstration plant in Unincorporated  Joint Venture (UJV) with Pilbara Minerals (ASX: PLS) commenced  construction. Pilot scale testing and a Front-End Engineering and  Design (FEED) study for ZESTY were completed, delivering the  production of green iron from multiple ores and the first green  iron briquettes.  Leilac entered into a JV agreement with Heidelberg Materials  (FWB: HEI) for Leilac-2, signed global licence and collaboration  agreements with leading U.S. Direct Air Capture (DAC) company,  Heirloom, and announced the development of two DAC projects  with Heirloom in Louisiana, USA.  Further information on Calix’s financial performance and the  progress of key projects can be found in the Calix Limited Annual  Report, as well as the investor centre on the Calix website.  Under the terms of the Employee Incentive Scheme (EIS) applying  to FY24, three Performance Gateways, more details of which can  be found in this Remuneration Report, are used to determine  performance-vesting in each year and are applied sequentially.  When applying the performance criteria to FY24, the Board assessed:  1) Gateway 1: the performance against the Company’s annual  safety and quality action plan was met and achieved in full.  2) Gateway 2: the Total Shareholder Returns (TSR) performance  was not met.  3) Gateway 3: the Group’s Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were  assessed for the business as 7.6 out of 10.

This remuneration report sets out the remuneration information for directors of Calix Limited and its controlled entities (“the Group” or  “Calix”) consisting of Calix Limited (“the Company”) and entities under its control, and other Key Management Personnel (“KMP”). For the  purposes of this report, KMP of the Group is defined as those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and  controlling major activities of the Company and the Group, directly or indirectly, including any director of the Company.  The key objectives of the Group’s remuneration policies are to align Calix’s directors, KMP and employees with shareholders’ interests,  while ensuring remuneration structures are fair and competitive. The policies, including an Employee Incentive Scheme (“EIS”), seek  to balance incentives to achieve annual short-term goals with incentives to create and execute opportunities that build long-term  shareholder value. The EIS, in particular, is designed to balance these goals by providing employees with ‘at risk’ rewards for their  performance. Subject to performance requirements being met, employees receive awards that vest over a period of six years.  The directors’ policies for determining the nature and amount of remuneration for directors and KMP of the Group follow:  Non-executive director remuneration  Non-executive directors’ remuneration is approved by the Board of Directors (“the Board”) and shareholders. Remuneration is reviewed  annually, based on market practice, duties and accountability. Independent external advice is sought when required. The maximum aggregate  of fees that can be paid to non-executive directors is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”).  Non-executive directors  The following people were non-executive directors of the Group during the 2024 financial year (“FY24”) and, unless otherwise indicated,  were classified as non-executive directors for the entire year.  Peter Turnbull, AM, Independent Chair  Alison Deans, Independent Director  Peter Dixon, Independent Director (appointed 1 January 2024)  Helen Fisher, Independent Director  Dr Sarah Ryan, Independent Director (appointed 1 January 2024)  KMP salary and retirement benefits  All KMP, including the CEO, receive a base salary, which is based on factors such as experience, skills and competencies. The Board  reviews KMP base salary levels annually by reference to the Group’s performance, individual performance and comparable information  from industry sectors. All Australian-based KMP employees also receive a superannuation guarantee contribution, which for FY24 was 11%  (10.5% for FY23) up to the concessional contributions cap, and do not receive any other retirement benefits.  Employee incentives  An EIS is applied based upon performance of both the Group and individual Key Performance Indicators (“KPI”). The Board sets yearly  KPIs for the Group to drive performance, appropriately balancing current and future value creation, and reflecting the nature and  strategy of the Group. The actual performance against KPIs is reviewed regularly and assessed at the end of the financial year by the  People, Culture and Nominations Committee to determine EIS outcomes.  The EIS is a hybrid share-based scheme that combines both short-term and long-term incentives. It is designed to retain and motivate  Calix’s employees, building alignment of employees’ interests with shareholders’ interests to deliver shareholder value, consistent with  the nature and strategy of the Group.  Details of the mechanisms by which the EIS operates are further set out in the Remuneration Report.  KMP remuneration  The following executives of the Group were classified as KMP during FY24 and, unless otherwise indicated, were classified as KMP for  the entire year.

Calix’s success  into the future will be based on its ability to commercialise its intellectual property assets and to continue to innovate and find new ways  to apply its capability. To this end, team members need to strike the right balance between achieving annual short-term goals whilst also  working towards new opportunities to build shareholder value by leveraging Calix’s technology. Calix’s ‘at-risk’ EIS was designed to balance  these objectives, providing rewards for performance in the current year that accrue over the medium to longer term.  Background  On 18 April 2018, at an extraordinary general meeting, the shareholders of Calix approved an EIS to operate once the Company was listed.  The Calix Officers & Employees Incentive Scheme (“EIS”) provides for the grant of rights and/or options to eligible officers and employees  (as determined by the Board) and is intended to provide competitive, performance-based remuneration supporting retention, incentive  and reward, and alignment with shareholders. Non-executive and independent directors are not invited to participate in the EIS.  Key terms of the EIS have been published on the ASX and the scheme is summarised below:  Overview of the EIS  The EIS is a hybrid scheme that provides both short-term and long-term incentive to all employees, including KMP – aligning employees’  remuneration and interests with shareholders’ interests. For KMP and senior executives, each round of the scheme operates over a  six-year period (including the re-test period), with a maximum option pool approved by the Board in year zero, the first tranche of  awards vesting at the end of year one, and the final tranche of awards vesting on the sixth anniversary of the initial option award.  The EIS for KMP and senior executives is delivered by granting participants zero priced options. Performance-vesting of the granted  options is subject to a series of three Performance Gateways assessed in each year of the three-year performance period. At the end of  each year of the 3 year performance period, options that did not meet annual performance gates are subjected to re-testing based on  criteria for Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) performance. Any un-vested options that did not vest at their testing date can be re-tested  annually between the testing date and the end of the financial year immediately after this date. Details and worked examples of the  performance criteria and vesting schedules over the six-year period are provided in this report.  37  DIRECTORS' REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL REPORT OTHER FY25 PRIORITIES                                                                                                                           REMUNERATION REPORT  ’  –  –  — —  — —  '  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –   ===== PAGE 40 ===== REMUNERATION REPORT (AUDITED)  Overview of the EIS continued  The first round of the EIS was made available to all Calix employees, including KMP (but excluding non-executive directors), at the end  of 2018 with an ability to earn parcels of options over the proceeding five-year period to 30 June 2024. The scheme was extended in  2022 with an additional round made available with the ability to earn parcels of options over the proceeding five-year period (EIS 2). The  Board has determined that the current EIS scheme will be replaced in FY25 with a more traditional short-term and long-term incentive  performance rights plan.  The Board typically limits the number of shares over which options will be issued under the EIS to 2% of the total number of shares on  issue (i.e. undiluted) in any one year. Subject to any limitations that might apply under the Corporations Act 2001 or limits under ASIC class  order relief, there is no limit on the number of options that may be issued under the EIS. The actual percentage of options on issue will  fluctuate as a result of changes in staffing levels.  Individual incentives and performance criteria for KMP and Senior Executives  The maximum potential award under the EIS for each executive is based on a percentage of gross annual salary, with the proportion of  total remuneration ‘at risk’ increasing with executive responsibility. The maximum potential award per year for senior executives is 40% of  their gross salary, 50% for the Chief Science Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and 60% for the Chief Executive Officer.  The actual award each year is determined as a percentage of maximum potential award, based on the three performance gateways  detailed below (performance vesting). The actual award from each year then vests over the subsequent three-year period with one third of  the actual award vesting immediately and one third at the end of each subsequent year (tenure vesting).  In an illustrative example – a senior executive is allocated a maximum possible 90,000 options under the EIS at the start of the three-year  period, reflecting 120% (40% x 3) of the executive’s gross salary. Assuming an annual salary of $225,000 this results in an allocation of  $270,000. Assuming $3 per Calix ordinary share at the commencement of the scheme this results in an allocation of 90,000 zero priced  options at the start of the scheme. At the end of each of the first three years of the scheme, the maximum potential award is 30,000  options, with the actual award being subject to three performance gateways (performance vesting). The actual award for each year, then  vests subject to tenure, with one third able to vest immediately, and the remaining two thirds vesting in equal tranches over the next two  years (tenure vesting).  Performance Gateways  Three Performance Gateways are used to determine performance-vesting in each year and are applied sequentially:  Gateway 1 – SHEQ performance  Gateway 1 is achieving the Company’s Safety, Health, Environment, and Quality Action Plan KPIs as agreed with the Board each year. If  the Safety Health, Environment, and Quality Action Plan KPIs are not met, then options can be awarded for performance that year. This  Performance Gateway is designed to ensure that Safety, Health and Environmental performance of our team members and Quality of  our products and services remain paramount at all times. The Action Plan reflects International Standard ISO45001, against which the  Company is audited annually.  Gateway 2 – Share price performance  Gateway 2 assesses absolute share price performance over the year as measured by Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”), as described  below. TSR is measured as Calix’s share price performance, being the 30-day Volume-Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) over the 15 days  preceding, and the 15 days after, June 30 in the prior financial year (“Baseline TSR”) as compared with the 30-day VWAP over the 15 days  preceding and the 15 days after 30 June in the current financial year (“Measured TSR”). If the Measured TSR for a particular financial year is  not higher than the Baseline TSR for that period of measurement, any options earned under Performance Gateway 3 (as described below)  remain unvested. However, such unvested options may vest if at any time before the end of the financial year immediately after each  testing period, the 30-day VWAP for Calix’s shares exceeds the applicable Baseline TSR for those unvested options. This mechanism is  designed to ensure that shorter-term goals or advances do not dominate over more significant, longer-term value creation opportunities,  so that KMP continue to balance shorter term outcomes with a longer-term view of outcomes for a multi-year, multi-application  value opportunity.  Gateway 3 – Performance against KPIs  Gateway 3 measures company and executive performance against KPIs agreed each year with the Board. These KPIs reflect the corporate  milestone targets set for each line of business, and are communicated to the market at regular times during the year via the Companys  market updates and the scheduled lodgment of its financial reports. Gateway 3 helps to drive achievement of annual performance metrics  that balance both short-term and long-term shareholder value creation.  The EIS options that have passed through all three gateways will be classed as “performance-vested”. These options will then be subject to  tenure-based vesting with one third vesting immediately. The other two thirds will then vest in two equal traches at the end of each of the  two full financial years following the performance year, provided the KMP or senior executive remains a full-time employee of the Company.  To continue the illustrative example above:  1) In year one, a KPI result of 7/10 was achieved, meaning 21,000 options have performance-vested for the senior executive above. Of  these 21,000 options, one third is immediately tenure-vested, while the remaining 14,000 options vest in equal tranches at one year and  two years after the performance year, provided the senior executive is still with the Company.  2) In year two, a KPI result of 6/10 was achieved, meaning 18,000 options have performance-vested. Of these 18,000 options, one third is  immediately tenure-vested, while the remaining 12,000 options vest in equal tranches at one year and two years after the performance  year, provided the senior executive is still with the Company.  3) In year three, a KPI result of 9/10 was achieved, meaning 27,000 options have performance-vested. Of these 27,000 options, one  third is immediately tenure-vested, while the remaining 18,000 options vest in equal tranches at one year and two years after the  performance year, provided the senior executive is still with the Company.

The Board would award those options if the team delivered a TSR performance measured as follows:  EIS 2 Tranche 1 (grant date in 2024) options where the Baseline TSR was $4.22:  50% of the remaining unvested options if the Measured TSR at the end of the performance vesting period has exceeded the 1 July 2023  Baseline TSR by 75%, being $7.38; and  The remaining 50% of the unvested options if the Measured TSR at the end of the performance vesting period has exceeded the  1 July 2023 Baseline TSR by 125%, being $9.50.  For the second and third Tranches of the EIS 2 (granted in 2024), if any options remain unvested (other than due to the timing of the grant  of such options), the Board will be able to perform a further performance review annually between end of FY25 to FY26. The Board will be  able to performance vest those options if the team has delivered a TSR performance, defined as follows:  EIS 2 Tranche 2 and 3 (grant date in 2024) options where the Baseline TSR was $4.22:  50% of the remaining unvested options if the Measured TSR at the end of the performance vesting period has exceeded the 1 July 2023  Baseline TSR by 75%, being $7.38; and  The remaining 50% of the unvested options if the Measured TSR at the end of the last performance vesting period has exceeded the  1 July 2023 Baseline TSR by 125%, being $9.50.  39  DIRECTORS' REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL REPORT OTHER FY25 PRIORITIES                                                  REMUNERATION REPORT  –  –  –  –   ===== PAGE 42 ===== REMUNERATION REPORT (AUDITED)  Performance Gateways continued  If TSR performance vested, these options will then be subject to tenure-based vesting over three years.  These provisions are a key mechanism to ensure that innovations that create long-term value for shareholders are rewarded, and that the  Company and KMP balance their focus on long-term value creation, while also delivering on shorter term KPIs focused on the foundations  of long-term value.  Following on from the illustrative example above, the table below shows how this further performance testing works:  Illustrative example: vesting of options  A maximum total of 90,000 options  are allocated to a senior executive  Vesting of each tranche of options under the initial allocation  of a 90,000 option pool for a senior executive  Beginning  year 1  End of  year 1  End of  year 2  End of  year 3  End of  year 4  End of  year 5  Tranche 1 earned options in year 1: 7/10 KPI result  7,000  7,000  7,000  Tranche 2 earned options in year 2: 6/10 KPI result  6,000  6,000  6,000  Tranche 3 earned options in year 3: 9/10 KPI result  9,000  9,000  9,000  Unearned options (24,000)  3,000 1  7,000 2  8,000 3  5,000 4  1,000 5  Total options earned and vested  7,000  13,000  22,000  15,000  9,000  If share price 75% above 1 July 2023 Baseline  50% of  3,000  = 1,500  50% of  7,000  = 3,500  50% of  8,000   4,000  50% of  5,000  = 2,500 6  If share price 125% above 1 July 2023 Baseline  50% of  3,000  = 1,500  50% of  7,000  = 3,500  50% of  8,000   4,000  50% of  5,000  = 2,500 6  1.

Claw back provision  In the event of fraud, dishonesty, or other material breaches of company policy, the Board reserves the right to reassess and reduce or  immediately lapse all unexercised options, whether vested or not.  The EIS and a takeover or change of control  If the Board recommends that a takeover bid be accepted by the Company’s shareholders or the Board determines that a transaction has  occurred that results in change of control, the Board may at its discretion, determine that any unvested options can vest and be exercised  and included in the equity transaction.  Vesting of options for performance to 30 June 2024  When applying the performance criteria for the period to 30 June 2024, the Board assessed the actual performance against the  performance vesting criteria as follows:  Gateway 1: performance against the Company’s annual safety and quality action plan was met and achieved in full.  Gateway 2: the TSR performance was not met.  Gateway 3: the Group KPIs were assessed for the business as 7.6 out of 10 (the KPI Dashboard for FY24 follows).  As a result of Gateway 2 not being met, the options granted for FY24 have not performance-vested at this point in time.  However, as outlined above, the Board will perform a further performance review in the following manner:  1. At the end of FY25, if the Measured TSR is above Baseline TSR, Gateway 2 will be met and the FY24 options will performance-vest. They  will then be subject to tenure-based vesting; or  2. At the end of FY25, if the team has delivered a superior TSR performance as defined in the further testing criteria, either 50% or 100% of  unearned options from FY24, under the second round of the EIS, will performance vest. They will then be subject to tenure-based vesting.

The Leilac-2 project team, in close collaboration  with Heidelberg Materials, IKN, and other project partners, worked quickly and effectively to assess and select a new site for the facility,  minimising impact to the project. Leilac successfully advanced two paid projects through its pipeline with Heirloom for Direct Air Capture,  as well as expanding the pipeline with several new projects in the scoping phase. Leilac also signed a global, perpetual licence agreement  with Heirloom, with a minimum royalty of US$3 per tonne of CO2 captured. The green methanol project, located in South Australia and in  collaboration with Vast and Mabanaft, was advanced with the Basis-of-Design completed. Following the close of FY24, Calix was awarded  a $15m grant from the Australian Government’s Carbon Capture Technologies Program to support the construction of the project.  In Sustainable Processing, construction commenced on time and budget for the spodumene processing demonstration plant developed  in a an unincorporated joint venture with Pilbara Minerals. An expanded ore testing program and Front-End Engineering Design (FEED)  study for a ZESTY demonstration facility for green iron were both successfully completed, with support from Australian Renewable  Energy Agency (ARENA) and in collaboration with the Heavy Industry Low-carbon Transition Cooperative Research Centre (HILT CRC).  Metallisation rates suitable for downstream use in either a melter or blast furnace were achieved from multiple ores from HILT CRC  member companies and beyond, while several tests reached sufficient metallisation levels for feed directly to an electric arc furnace.  A Final Investment Decision (FID) for the ZESTY demonstration plant has not yet been taken, as financing for the project is still being  progressed. A general pre-FEED study has been completed for an alumina demonstration facility following a successful test program and  a prospective techno-economic assessment conducted in collaboration with the HILT CRC.  In Advanced Batteries, commercial format packs have been produced and were installed in an electric scooter for further testing. An  assessment of the Advanced Batteries value proposition found that it mostly related to a process improvement. As such, the Advanced  Batteries business was incorporated into the Sustainable Processing line of business, with many activities paused and resources  redeployed to other immediate priorities. The Calix technology’s advantages for the manufacture of battery materials remain prospective  and will be pursued under the sustainable processing line of business.  The Water business was judged to have performed outstandingly, with substantial organic growth in revenue and increasing gross  margins, particularly in the USA. Two new magnesium hydroxide plants were successfully commissioned, increasing the total capacity of  the U.S. business by 50%. The business is well positioned for further growth in prospective markets.  In magnesium (Mg) metal – a patent was filed for a new production route for pure magnesium and the basis-of-design for a production  facility postponed while this intellectual property was developed. In Magnesia specialties, applications in health were pursued as part of  the Solving Antimicrobial Resistance in Agribusiness, Food, and Environments Cooperative Research Centre (“SAAFE CRC”) with early work  continuing to provide prospective results. Long-term testing of marine coatings applications in collaboration with a coating supplier and a  major end-customer continued successfully. Additionally, outstanding results were achieved in the agricultural application of BOOSTER- Mag in controlling fungal disease in olive trees.  After assessing the KPI contributions from each line of business, the Board determined a weighted average KPI score for the Group for  FY24 of 7.6 out of 10.  41  DIRECTORS' REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL REPORT OTHER FY25 PRIORITIES                                                                 REMUNERATION REPORT  -  ===== PAGE 44 ===== REMUNERATION REPORT (AUDITED)  The table below details certain measures in respect of the current financial year and previous four financial years that are monitored as  indicators of the performance of the Group.

Summary of material accounting policies  The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial report are set out below. The financial report covers the  consolidated group of Calix Limited (“the Company”) and its controlled entities (“the Group”).  Accounting policies are selected and applied in a manner that ensures that the resulting financial information satisfies the concepts of  relevance and reliability, thereby ensuring that the substance of the underlying transactions or other events is reported. Other material  accounting policies are contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements to which they relate.  The accounting policies have been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.  a) Basis of preparation  The financial report is a general purpose financial report that has been prepared in accordance and compliance with Australian Accounting  Standards (including Australian Accounting Interpretations) of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) and Corporations Act 2001  as appropriate for profit oriented entities; and therefore this financial report also complies with the International Financial Reporting  Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. The financial report was approved by the Calix Limited Board of  Directors on 27 August 2024.  i) Historical cost convention  The financial report has been prepared on an accrual basis and is based on historical costs, modified, where applicable by the  measurement at fair value of selected non-current assets, financial assets and financial liabilities.  ii) Critical accounting estimates  The preparation of financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise  its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity,  or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in Note 1(h).  b) Going concern  The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis which contemplates the continuity of normal business  activities and the realisation of assets and discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Group has incurred a loss after tax  for the year ended 30 June 2024 of $26.2m (30 June 2023 loss $23.4m). The Group has cash balances of $43.0m (30 June 2023 $74.5m),  net assets of $84.0m (30 June 2023 $105.0m) and net current assets of $27.0m (30 June 2023 $68.2m). Current loans and borrowings  are $1.5m (including lease liabilities of $0.8m) compared to 30 June 2023 $0.7m. Operating cash outflow for the year was $11.6m  (30 June 2023 $17.3m).  Management have prepared cashflow forecasts underpinning the basis of preparation as a going concern. These cashflow forecasts for  the Group are dependent on a combination of the following assumptions:  The magnesia business to continue to experience growth in volumes and gross margins in both Australia and the US and to have lower  capital expenditure investment in new plant than over the prior period;  Continued growth in revenues in Leilac associated with paid engineering services and a slowdown in the rate of growth of its  operating expenditures; and  A focus and prioritisation of externally funded projects and a reduced level of pure research and development expenditure.  Based on these forecasts and assumptions,  the directors of Calix consider that the Group will continue to fulfill all obligations as and  when they fall due for the foreseeable future and accordingly consider that the Group’s financial statements should be prepared on  a going concern basis.  c) Rounding of amounts  The Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Legislative Instrument 2016/191, relating to the ‘rounding off’ of amounts in the directors’  report. Amounts in the directors’ report have been rounded off to the nearest thousand dollars, unless otherwise stated, in accordance  with the instrument.  d) Goods and services tax  Revenues, expenses, and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST, except where the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable  from the Australian Tax Office. In these circumstances the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of  an item of the expense.

Summary of material accounting policies continued  e) New or amended accounting standards and interpretations  The group has adopted all of the new or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting  Standards Board (“AASB”) that are mandatory for the current reporting period. Any new or amended Accounting Standards or  Interpretations that are not yet mandatory have not been early adopted.  f) New accounting standards and interpretations not yet mandatory or early adopted  Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have recently been issued or amended but are not yet mandatory, have not  been early adopted by the consolidated entity for the annual reporting period ended 30 June 2024 and effective from 30 June 2027.  The following new and amended accounting standards are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s consolidated  financial statements:  Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current and Non-Current Liabilities with Covenants (Amendments to AASB 101)  Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture (AASB 2014-10).  Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (AASB 18), issued June 2024 and effective from 30 June 2027, may have a significant  impact on the financial statement disclosures, their effect though has not been assessed.  g) Foreign currency transactions and balances  Functional and presentation currency  The functional currency of each of the Group’s entities is measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which  that entity operates. The consolidated financial statements are presented in Australian Dollars which is the Company’s functional and the  Group’s presentation currency.  Transactions and balances  Foreign currency transactions are translated into functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of transaction.  Foreign currency monetary items are translated at the year-end exchange rate. Non-monetary items measured at historical cost continue  to be carried at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair value are reported at the  exchange rate at the date when fair values were determined.  Exchange differences arising on the translation of monetary items are recognised in the profit or loss, except where deferred in equity as a  qualifying cash flow or net investment hedge.  Group companies  The financial results and position of foreign operations whose functional currency is different from the Group’s presentation currency  are translated as follows:  assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates prevailing at that reporting date; and  income and expense are translated at average exchange rates for the year.  Exchange differences arising on translation of foreign operations are transferred directly to the Group’s foreign currency translation  reserve in the statement of financial position. These differences are also recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as other  comprehensive income. The foreign currency reserve is recognised in profit or loss when the foreign operation is disposed of.  h) Critical accounting estimates and judgments  The directors evaluate estimates and judgements incorporated into the financial report based on historical knowledge and best available  current information. Estimates assume a reasonable expectation of future events and are based on current trends and economic data,  obtained both externally and within the Group. Information on material estimates and judgements used in applying the accounting policies  can be found in the following notes:  Note  Income tax  6  Goodwill impairment test  11  Share-based payment transactions  20  i) Comparatives  Certain comparative balances have been changed to align with the current year classification. The main items adjusted were:  Interest income  Historically the Group classified 'Interest income' as 'Other income. In the current period the Group has reclassified 'Interest income separately. As a result, $1.1m was reclassified from 'Other income' to 'Interest income' in the comparative period.  Loans to directors  Historically, the Group has classified 'Receipts of repayment of loans to directors' as a financing activity in the Statement of Cash Flows.  In the current period, the Group has reclassified these to investing activities. As a result, $1.1m was reclassified in the comparative period.  Other comparative balance changes are disclosed in Notes 6, 16, 22, 28.

Revenue and other income continued  Recognition and Measurement  The Group primarily generates revenue from the sale of magnesium hydroxide liquid (MHL) to customers. Additionally, the Group sells  and rents MHL dosing units and equipment for dispersing MHL into customers’ applications. Revenue from contracts with customers is  recognised when control of the goods or services is transferred to the customer, reflecting the consideration to which the Group expects  to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  Revenue is recognised and disclosed net of trade allowances, duties, and taxes paid. The Group follows the five-step approach to revenue  recognition, which requires: (i) identifying contracts, (ii) identifying separate performance obligations, (iii) determining the transaction price,  (iv) allocating the transaction price to each performance obligation, and (v) recognising revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied.  Product Sales (MHL, Dosing Unit, and Equipment Sales)  Revenue is recognised when control of the product has passed to the customer and the product is ready for its intended use. Virtually  all product sales constitute a single performance obligation at this point of intended use.  Payment terms are typically 30 days after receipt of the goods.  Rentals  Revenue from rental activities is recognised as customers obtain the benefit of the service over time. Rental income is recognised on a  straight-line basis over the corresponding rental period. If payments are received in advance, the income is deferred to the period when  the service is delivered.  Engineering Services  The Group provides engineering services to clients in the lime, cement, and sustainable processing industries, related to the application of the  Calix Groups calcination technology to their specific requirements. The terms of individual contracts determine when the revenue is recognised.  For contracts where the engagement is for delivery of a bespoke report or technical specifications as the main performance obligation,  revenues are recognised at a point in time when the report is provided at the completion of the project or term for the deliverable as set  out in the client purchase order or contract.  For contracts where a service is being delivered over a period of time, the time and materials are recharged to the customer as they are  performed, and the associated revenue is recognised during the period of service. Payment terms depend on contract specifics and  usually range from 30 to 60 days.  Grant income  Government grants are recognised when received or when the right to receive payment is established. Government grants related to costs are  deferred and recognised in the profit or loss over the period necessary to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate.  R&D incentive income  R&D incentive income relates to eligible research expenditure incurred for current projects. The claimed amounts were reviewed externally  to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Australian Taxation Office and AusIndustry.  Other Income  Other income includes gains on disposal of items of property, plant and equipment and other receipts. The amount of income is  determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item.  Disaggregation of revenue  The disaggregation of revenue from contracts with customers is as follows:  Revenue  Products  from rental  Other  sold  agreements  services  Total  $’000  $’000  $’000  $’000  2024  Magnesia  20,642  362  21,004  Leilac  3,186  3,186  Other  20,642  362  3,186  24,190  2023  Magnesia  18,257  213  18,470  Leilac  48  48  Other  82  82  18,257  213  130  18,600  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL REPORT  LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS FY24 HIGHLIGHTS BUSINESS UPDATES SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT CALIX ANNUAL REPORT 2024                                                                                                                                                          54  ’  —  — —  — —  —  —  —  — —  — —   ===== PAGE 57 ===== 4.

Recognition and Measurement  Current tax  The income tax benefit for the year comprises current income tax benefit and deferred tax benefit. Current income tax expense charged  to the profit or loss is the tax payable on taxable income calculated using applicable income tax rates enacted, or substantially enacted,  as at the end of the reporting period together with the research and development claim submitted for the reporting period. Current tax  liabilities/assets are therefore measured at the amounts expected to be paid to/recovered from the relevant taxation authority.  Deferred tax  Deferred income tax expense reflects movements in deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability balances during the year as well as  unused tax losses. Current and deferred income tax expense/(benefit) is charged or credited directly to equity instead of the profit or loss  when the tax relates to items that are credited or charged directly to equity.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are ascertained based on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their  carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets also result where amounts have been fully expensed but future tax deductions  are available. No deferred income tax will be recognised from the initial recognition of an asset or liability, excluding a business combination,  where there is no effect on accounting or taxable profit or loss or does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the  liability is settled, based on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period. Their measurement also reflects  the manner in which management expects to recover or settle the carrying amount of the related asset or liability. Deferred tax assets  relating to temporary differences and unused tax losses are recognised only to the extent that is it probable that future taxable profit will  be available against which the benefits of the deferred tax asset can be utilised.  Where the temporary difference exists in relation to investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and joint ventures, deferred tax  assets and liabilities are not recognised where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is not  probable that the reversal will occur in the foreseeable future.  Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right of set-off exists and it is intended that net settlement or  simultaneous realisation and settlement of the respective asset and liability will occur. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where  a legally enforceable right of set-off exists, the deferred tax assets and liabilities related to income taxes levied by the same taxation  authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where it is intended that the net settlement or simultaneous  realisation and settlement of the respective asset and liability will occur in future periods in which significant amounts of deferred assets  or liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled.

They are presented as current assets unless collection is not expected for more than 12 months after  the reporting date. Trade receivables are generally due for settlement within 30 days.  Recoverability of trade receivables  Credit risk management processes  Credit risk is managed through the maintenance of procedures ensuring to the extent possible, that customers and counterparties  to transactions are of sound credit worthiness. Such monitoring is used in assessing receivables for impairments. Where the Group is  unable to ascertain a satisfactory credit risk profile in relation to a customer or counterparty, the risk may be further managed through  obtaining security by way of personal or commercial guarantees over assets of sufficient value which can be claimed against in the event  of any default. Where a debtor is more than 60 days overdue, and there is no agreed payment plan in place, the debt shall be considered  impaired and a bad debt provision shall be raised in accordance with the Group’s policy on recoverability of trade receivables, see Note 22.  Where a debtor is more than 90 days overdue, and there is no agreed payment plan in place, the debt shall be defined to be in default on  the basis that there is a low expectation of recoverability of the amount.  Recognition and measurement of expected credit losses  The Group applies the AASB 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance  for all trade receivables and contract assets. Trade receivables and contract assets have shared credit risk characteristics and, as such,  the expected loss rates for trade receivables are a reasonable approximation of loss rates for contract assets. Losses incurred in the last  3 years represent less than 1% of receivables and are immaterial. Therefore, no provision for expected credit losses has been recorded.  Other receivables are recognised at amortised cost, less any provision for expected credit losses.  Due to the short-term nature of the receivables, their carrying amount is assumed to approximate fair value. The maximum exposure to  credit risk at the end of the reporting period is the carrying amount of each class of receivables mentioned above. Refer to Note 22 for  more information on the risk management policy of the Group and credit quality of the receivables.  R&D incentive receivable  The Company was eligible, in the prior year, for an R&D grant which was receivable after the Australia Tax Office processes the Company’s  tax return. The amount of R&D grant receivable is accrued based on eligible expenses incurred during the prior financial year. The  company exceeded the $20m group turnover threshold to be eligible for the R&D incentive rebate in the current year and therefore is not  eligible for the cash rebate from the ATO.

Non-current assets – intangibles continued  Capitalised development costs  The capitalised development costs intangible asset relates to expenditure incurred on the development, design and construction of cement  and lime manufacturing; development, design and construction of lithium processing (see note 12); and BOOSTER-Mag technologies.  The costs were recognised on the basis that they were incurred in the development phase, in accordance with AASB 138, through the  demonstration of technical feasibility of completion, the intention to complete and use or sell the assets, as well as the clear path to  economic benefits, the availability of technical and financial resources, and reliable measurement of expenditure. The capitalised development  costs are not amortised until the associated product and service are demonstrated to be available for commercial use and an appropriate  amortisation period set. A $0.2m impairment expense was recognized in relation to capitalised development costs associated with a  refractory project that has discontinued and costs associated with the decision to move the Leilac 2 facility from Hanover to Ennigeloh.  Patent and trademarks  Patents and trademarks are recognised at cost of acquisition. Patents and trademarks have a finite life and are carried at cost less any  accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses. Amortisation is systematically allocated over the useful life of each patent and trademark.  In calculating amortisation costs, patents are taken to have a useful life of 20 years, trademarks are taken to have a useful life of 10 years.  11. Goodwill  June 2024  June 2023  $’000  $’000  Goodwill  3,638  3,638  Total goodwill  3,638  3,638  Accounting for goodwill  Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business where the fair value of the consideration exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired.  Goodwill is not amortised, instead it is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate  that it might be impaired and is carried as cost less accumulated impairment losses. The cash generating unit (CGU) to which the goodwill  relates is the US Water business.  Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount to the carrying value of the asset. For the current period, the  recoverable amount was determined based on fair value less costs of disposal calculations which required the use of assumptions. In order  to calculate the recoverable amount, cash flows associated with the US operations, which is the cash generating unit to which the goodwill  was assigned, was forecasted for the next 5 years. The current budget is the primary source of assumed values. The growth rate used in  the cash flow forecast for the terminal value was 3%, being the current years US inflation rate. The revenue forecast assumes a compound  annual growth rate of 9.22% over the 5-year forecast period. The discount rate used in the cash flow forecast was 10%, being an externally  sourced rate based on an analysis of the Group. The growth rate of 3% and the discount rate were also used to determine the terminal value.  A sensitivity analysis was performed on the key assumptions of the cash flow forecast to determine how much each of the assumptions  would have to move in order for the recoverable amount to drop below the carrying amount of the goodwill. In the case of the revenue  growth, it would need to drop to compound annual growth rate of 8.68% before an impairment would need to be recognised. In the case of  the discount factor, this would need to rise above 11.6% before an impairment would need to be recognised. Impairment losses on goodwill  are taken to the profit or loss and not subsequently reversed.  12.

Recognition and Measurement  Each class of plant and equipment is carried at cost, any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Plant and equipment are  measured on the cost basis less depreciation and impairment losses. The cost of plant and equipment constructed includes the cost of  materials, direct labour, borrowing costs and an appropriate proportion of fixed and variable overheads. Subsequent costs are included  in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits  associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measure reliably. All other repairs and maintenance  expenses are charged to the income statements during the financial period in which they are incurred.  Property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land, is depreciated or amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life  for the asset. Estimated useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed at the end of the reporting period. The depreciation rates  used for each class for depreciable assets are shown in the list below. Land is not subject to depreciation.  Office, furniture, fittings and equipment: 10%-25%  Baccus Marsh calciner and R&D facilities: 5%-25%  Slurry manufacturing and application assets: 2%-20%  LEILAC plants: 20-50%  Mining tenements: extraction rate of ore  Midstream UJV Project: work in progress – not depreciating yet  The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date. An asset’s carrying amount  is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.  Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount. These gains or losses are included in the  statement of comprehensive income.  Mining tenements and associated mineral resources  The costs of acquiring mining tenements and associated mineral resources are capitalised as part of property plant and equipment  and amortised over the estimated productive life of each applicable resource. Amortisation commences when extraction of the mineral  resource commences. The tenement is expected to be retired in 2044.  Impairment  In the year ended 30 June 2024, no assets were found to require impairment under the Group’s accounting policy (2023: $NIL).

The balance is recognised as a current liability with the amount being normally  paid within 30 days of recognition of the liability.  The carrying amounts of the Group’s trade and other payables are denominated in Australian dollars. Due to the short-term nature of  the payables, their carrying amount is assumed to approximate fair value.

Any difference between the proceeds and the redemption amount is recognised as profit or loss over the period of the borrowings  using the effective interest rate method.  Where there is an unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date, the loans or  borrowings are classified as non-current.

The right-of-use asset is measured at cost, which comprises the  initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for, as applicable, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date net of any  lease incentives received, any initial direct costs incurred, and an estimate of costs expected to be incurred for dismantling and removing  the underlying asset, and restoring the site or asset. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the unexpired period  of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset, whichever is the shorter. Where the Group expects to obtain ownership of the leased  asset at the end of the lease term, the depreciation is over its estimated useful life. Right-of use assets are subject to impairment or  adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.  The Group has elected not to recognise a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability for short-term leases with terms of 12  months or less and leases of assets whose fair value is less than $10,000. Lease payments on these assets are expensed to profit or loss  as incurred.  Lease liabilities  A lease liability is recognised at the commencement date of a lease. The lease liability is initially recognised at the present value  of the lease payments to be made over the term of the lease, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate  cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments comprise of fixed payments less any lease  incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, amounts expected to be paid under residual value  guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option when the exercise of the option is reasonably certain to occur, and any anticipated  termination penalties.  The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Lease  liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The carrying amounts are remeasured if there is a change  in the following: future lease payments arising from a change in an index, or a rate used; residual guarantee; lease term; certainty of a  purchase option and termination penalties. When a lease liability is remeasured, an adjustment is made to the corresponding right-of use  asset, or to profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is fully written down.

Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation  at the reporting date. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future  cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific  to the liability. The increase in the provision resulting from the passage of time is recognised in finance costs.  Employee benefits  Provision is made for the Group’s liability for employee benefits arising from services rendered by employees to balance date. Employee  benefits that are expected to be settled within one year have been measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liability is  settled, plus related on-costs.  Employee benefits payable later than one year have been measured at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made  for those benefits. In determining the liability, consideration is given to employee wage increases and the probability that the employee  may satisfy vesting requirements. Those cash flows are discounted using market yields on high quality corporate bonds with terms to  maturity that match the expected timing of cash outflows.  Rehabilitation provision  The Group recognises a mine rehabilitation provision on the basis that it has an obligation to restore the site of the mine in Myrtle Springs  to its original condition and the cost to do so is uncertain. The measurement of the provision is the present value of the best estimate of  the expenditure required to settle the obligation as at the end of the reporting period. It should also be noted that a bond of $274,000  was lodged on 9 October 2014 with the South Australia Department of State Development to be applied to rehabilitation of the area at  cessation of mining activity, on the basis of a Program for Environmental Protection and Rehabilitation (PEPR) which was approved by the  South Australia Department of State Development. This bond appears in Note 8 under deposits paid.

Issued capital continued  Ordinary Shares  Ordinary shares entitle the holder to participate in dividends and the proceeds on winding up of the Company in proportion to the number  of and amounts paid on the shares held. On a show of hands, every holder of ordinary shares present at a meeting in person or by proxy, is  entitled to one vote, and upon a poll each share is entitled to one vote. Ordinary shares have no par value and the Company does not have  a limited amount of authorised capital.  Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Any transaction costs arising on the issue of ordinary shares are recognised directly in equity as a  reduction of the share proceeds received.  ESS withdrawals  Employee Share Scheme (“ESS”) withdrawals are facilitated by transferring pre-allocated shares from the ESS trust to ordinary capital. In  this way, the share-based payment reserve is reversed for the amount of the shares and the shares are transferred to the recipient. During  the year ended 30 June 2024, $nil in shares were issued from the ESS trust (2023: $nil).  EIS withdrawals  Calix Officers & Employee Incentive Scheme (EIS) withdrawals are vested rights that have been exercised by the employee into ordinary  capital. The share-based payment reserve is reversed for the amount of the shares and the shares are transferred to the recipient. During  the year ended 30 June 2024, $773,516 in shares were issued (2023: $935,412).  19.

The cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss when the net  investment is disposed of.  Share-based payment reserve  The share-based payment reserve is used to recognise shares and rights earned by employees and officers as part of the ESS plan and  the EIS. Shares issued through the ESS are valued at the grant date fair value of shares issued and vested to employees and directors.  These reserves are reversed against share capital held by ESS plan when the shares vest. The rights which are as part of the EIS are  valued using options valuation models which take into account vesting criteria, market price and the exercise windows. See Note 20 for  more information on share-based payments.

Share based payments  Calix Officers & Employees Incentive Scheme  On 18 April 2018, at an extraordinary general meeting, the shareholders of Calix approved an EIS to operate once the Company was listed.  The Calix Officers & Employees Incentive Scheme (“EIS”) provides for the grant of rights and/or options to eligible officers and employees  (as determined by the Board) and is intended to provide competitive, performance-based remuneration supporting retention, incentive  and reward, and alignment with shareholders. Non-executive and independent directors are not invited to participate in the EIS.  Overview of the EIS  The first round of the EIS was made available to all Calix employees, including KMP (but excluding non-executive directors), at the end of  2018 with an ability to earn parcels of options over the proceeding five-year period to 30 June 2024. The scheme was extended in 2022  with an additional round made available with the ability to earn parcels of options over the proceeding five-year. The Board has determined  that the current EIS scheme will be replaced in FY25 with a more traditional short-term and long-term incentive performance rights plan.  The Board typically limits the number of shares over which options will be issued under the EIS to 2% of the total number of shares on  issue (i.e. undiluted) in any one year. Subject to any limitations that might apply under the Corporations Act 2001 or limits under ASIC class  order relief, there is no limit on the number of options that may be issued under the EIS. The actual percentage of options on issue will  fluctuate as a result of changes in staffing levels.  Performance Gateways  Three Performance Gateways are used to determine performance-vesting in each year and are applied sequentially:  Gateway 1 – SHEQ performance  Gateway 1 is achieving the Company’s Safety, Health, Environment, and Quality Action Plan KPIs as agreed with the Board each year. If  the Safety Health, Environment, and Quality Action Plan KPIs are not met, then options can be awarded for performance that year. This  Performance Gateway is designed to ensure that Safety, Health and Environmental performance of our team members and Quality of  our products and services remain paramount at all times. The Action Plan reflects International Standard ISO45001, against which the  Company is audited annually.  Gateway 2 – Share price performance  Gateway 2 assesses absolute share price performance over the year as measured by Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”), as described  below. TSR is measured as Calix’s share price performance, being the 30-day Volume-Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) over the 15 days  preceding, and the 15 days after, June 30 in the prior financial year (“Baseline TSR”) as compared with the 30-day VWAP over the 15 days  preceding and the 15 days after 30 June in the current financial year (“Measured TSR”). If the Measured TSR for a particular financial year is  not higher than the Baseline TSR for that period of measurement, any options earned under Performance Gateway 3 (as described below)  remain unvested. However, such unvested options may vest if at any time before the end of the financial year immediately after each  testing period, the 30-day VWAP for Calix’s shares exceeds the applicable Baseline TSR for those unvested options.  Gateway 3 – Performance against KPIs  Gateway 3 measures company and executive performance against KPIs agreed each year with the Board. These KPIs reflect the corporate  milestone targets set for each line of business, and are communicated to the market at regular times during the year via the Companys  market updates and the scheduled lodgment of its financial reports. Gateway 3 helps to drive achievement of annual performance metrics  that balance both short-term and long-term shareholder value creation.  The EIS options that have passed through all three gateways will be classed as “performance-vested”. These options will then be subject  to tenure-based vesting with one third vesting immediately. The other two thirds will then vest in two equal traches at the end of each  of the two full financial years following the performance year, provided the KMP or senior executive remains a full-time employee of  the Company.  During the years ended 30 June 2024, the Group recognised a share based payment expense related to the number of options vesting and  to be vested in connection with the fulfilment of the vesting conditions related to these financial periods as well as the forecasted value  of those options at their expected exercise date. For non senior leadership team employees the fair value of the options was determined  to be the share price on the date the offer was given to the employees, this value was determined a Black-Scholes formula. For the  senior leadership team a Monte Carlo simulation pricing model was used for valuing the options, as market based conditions attach to  these options.  The Monte Carlo simulation model used the following inputs to determine fair value as at 30 June 2024:  Valuation model inputs  Model Inputs  Grant date  1 July 2023  Exercise price  $NIL  Expiry date maximum  30 June 2028  Expected volatility  50-55%  Dividend yield  0%  Average risk-free interest rate  4.28%  Share price at grant date  $4.17  Fair value per option for KMP and senior executives  $3.70 - $3.90  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL REPORT  LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS FY24 HIGHLIGHTS BUSINESS UPDATES SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT CALIX ANNUAL REPORT 2024                                                                                             66  ’   ===== PAGE 69 ===== 20.

Diluted EPS is not  presented as potential ordinary shares shall be treated as dilutive, only when their conversion to ordinary shares would decrease EPS or increase the loss per share.  22. Financial risk management  The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk (including foreign currency risk and interest rate risk),  credit risk and liquidity risk. The Groups Treasury function is responsible for managing the liquidity requirements of the Group and  mitigating these financial risks through continuous monitoring and evaluation.  The Group adheres to a set of policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on liquidity risk, foreign  exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and the use of derivative financial instruments, as required, for hedging purposes. The Group  does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes. There have been no  changes to the Group’s exposure to financial risks or the manner in which it manages and measures these risks from the prior year.  The Group holds the following financial instruments, all of which are measured at amortised cost:  June 2024  June 2023  $’000  $’000  Financial assets  Cash and cash equivalents  42,958  74,466  Current trade and other receivables  3,921  1,839  Non-current trade and other receivables  301  293  Total financial assets  47,180  76,598  Financial liabilities  Trade and other payables  5,422  3,432  Current borrowings  760  318  Current lease liabilities  783  355  Non-current borrowings  7  Non-current lease liabilities  1,715  637  Total financial liabilities  8,680  4,749  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL REPORT  67  DIRECTORS' REPORT GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT OTHER FY25 PRIORITIES                                                                                                                                                                                                                 FINANCIAL REPORT  —  —  ’  —   ===== PAGE 70 ===== 22. Financial risk management continued  a) Credit risk  Exposure to credit risk relating to financial assets arises from the potential non-performance by counterparties of contract obligations  that could lead to a financial loss to the Group.  Credit risk is managed through the maintenance of procedures ensuring to the extent possible, that customers and counterparties to  transactions are of sound credit worthiness. Such monitoring is used in assessing receivables for impairments. Risk is also minimised  through investing surplus funds in financial institutions that maintain a high credit rating, or in entities that the Audit and Risk  Management Committee (“ARMC”) has otherwise cleared as being financially sound.  Where the Group is unable to ascertain a satisfactory credit risk profile in relation to a customer or counterparty, the risk may be further  managed through obtaining security by way of personal or commercial guarantees over assets of sufficient value which can be claimed  against in the event of any default.  Credit risk exposure  The maximum exposure to credit risk by class of recognised financial assets at balance date, excluding the value of any collateral or other  security held, is equivalent to the carrying value of the trade and other receivables (net of any provisions).  There is no significant concentration of credit risk with any single counter party or group of counter parties.  Past due but not impaired  As at 30 June 2024, trade receivables of $20,466 were past due but not impaired (2023: $28,958). These relate to a number of  independent customers for whom there is not recent history of default.  The aging analysis of trade receivables is as below:  June 2024  June 2023  $’000  $’000  Current  2,346  1,443  Less than 30 days  351  55  Less than 60 days  19  More than 60 days  20  25  Total trade receivables  2,736  1,523  The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets and are not past due. Based on the credit history of  these other classes, it is expected that these amounts will be received when due. The Group does not hold any collateral in relation to  theses receivables.  b) Liquidity risk  Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that the Group might encounter difficulty in settling its debts or otherwise meetings its obligations  related to financial liabilities.  Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents and the availability of funding through  adequate amount of credit facilities to meet obligations when due.  Management monitors the Groups liquidity levels (comprising undrawn borrowing facilities (Note 14) and cash and cash equivalents  (Note 7) on the basis of expected cash flows.  The following table details the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial assets and liabilities. The table has  been drawn up based on the cash flows expected to continue to be received/paid by the Group.

Refer to Note 1 (i).  c) Interest rate risk  Exposure to interest rate risk relates to cash and cash equivalents and borrowings, details of which are set out in Notes 7 and 14.  Profit or loss is sensitive to higher/lower interest income from cash and cash equivalents and interest expenses on borrowings as a result  of changes in interest rates. The following analysis shows the impact on post tax profit as a result of a movement in interest income and  expense from variable interest rate deposit and borrowing facilities.

Consolidation accounting policies  Business combinations occur where an acquirer obtains control over one or more businesses and results in the consolidation of assets  and liabilities. A business combination is accounted for by applying the acquisition method, unless it is a combination involving entities  or businesses under common control. The acquisition method requires that for each business combination one of the combining entities  must be identified as the acquirer (i.e. parent entity).  The business combination will be accounted for as at the acquisition date, which is the date that control over the acquiree is obtained by  the parent entity. At this date, the parent shall recognise, in the consolidated accounts, and subject to certain limited exceptions, the fair  value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In addition, contingent liabilities of the acquiree will be recognised where  a present obligation has been incurred and its fair value can be reliably measured.  The acquisition may result in the recognition of goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase. The method adopted for the measurement of  goodwill will impact on the measurement of any non-controlling interest to be recognised in the acquiree where less than 100% ownership  interest is held in the acquiree.  The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred for a business combination plus the acquisition date fair value of any  previously held equity interest shall form the cost of the investment in the separate financial statements.  Consideration may comprise the sum of the assets transferred by the acquirer, liabilities incurred by the acquirer to the former owners  of the acquiree and the equity interest issued by the acquirer. Included in the measurement of consideration transferred is any asset or  liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.

Joint arrangements  The Company holds a 45% interest in the “Midstream UJV”. The unincorporated joint venture agreement requires a supermajority vote,  being 75% of the total participating interest, for all major joint arrangement decisions. These include setting budgets, work programs,  manager or auditor appointment and other significant actions. The two joint venturers own the assets of the partnership as tenants  in common and are jointly and severally liable for the liabilities incurred by the partnership. The entity is therefore classified as a joint  operation and the consolidated entity recognises its share of all jointly held assets and liabilities, and their associated revenues and  expenses. The $12.2m gain on contribution to the Midstream UJV (2023: $NIL) represents the difference between Calix individual $7.7m  contribution to the UJV and Calix $19.9m overall 45% proportionally consolidated share of the UJV.

Determination of Tax Residency  Section 295 (3A) of the Corporations Acts 2001 requires that the tax residency of each entity which is included in the Consolidated Entity  Disclosure Statement (CEDS) be disclosed. In the context of an entity which was an Australian resident, “Australian resident” has the  meaning provided in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. The determination of tax residency involves judgment as the determination of  tax residency is highly fact dependent and there are currently several different interpretations that could be adopted, and which could  give rise to a different conclusion on residency.  Branches (permanent establishments)  Foreign branches of Australian subsidiaries are not separate level entities and therefore do not have a separate residency for  Australian tax purposes. Generally, the Australian subsidiary that the branch is a part of will be the relevant tax resident, rather than  the branch operations.

Independent Auditor’s Report    To the shareholders of Calix Limited  Report on the audit of the Financial Report    Opinion  We have audited the Financial Report of  Calix Limited (the Company).  In our opinion, the accompanying Financial  Report of the Company gives a true and  fair view, including of the Group’s  financial position as at 30 June 2024 and  of its financial performance for the year  then ended, in accordance with the  Corporations Act 2001, in compliance with  Australian Accounting Standards and the  Corporations Regulations 2001.  The Financial Report comprises:     • Consolidated statement of financial position as at 30  June 2024  • Consolidated statement of profit or loss and other  comprehensive income, Consolidated statement of  changes in equity, and Consolidated statement of  cash flows for the year then ended  • Notes, including material accounting policies  • Consolidated entity disclosure statement and  accompanying basis of preparation as at 30 June  2024  • Directors’ Declaration.  The Group consists of the Company and the entities it  controlled at the year end or from time to time during  the financial year.

We believe that the audit  evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.  Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for  the audit of the Financial Report section of our report.   We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical  requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board’s APES 110 Code of Ethics  for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) that are relevant to our  audit of the Financial Report in Australia.

These matters were addressed in the context of  our audit of the Financial Report as a whole, and  in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not  provide a separate opinion on these matters.    Going Concern   Refer to Note 1b to the Financial Report  The key audit matter  How the matter was addressed in our audit  The Group’s use of the going concern basis of  accounting and the associated extent of  uncertainty is a key audit matter due to the high  level of judgement required by us in evaluating  the Group’s assessment of going concern and  the events or conditions that may cast  significant doubt on their ability to continue as a  going concern. These are outlined in Note 1b.    The Directors have determined that the use of  the going concern basis of accounting is  appropriate in preparing the financial report.   Their assessment of going concern was based  on cash flow projections. The preparation of  these projections incorporated a number of  assumptions and significant judgements, and  the  Directors have concluded that the range of  possible outcomes considered in arriving at this  judgement does not give rise to a material  uncertainty casting significant doubt on the  Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.   We critically assessed the levels of uncertainty,  as it related to the Group’s ability to continue as  a going concern, within these assumptions and  judgements, focusing on the following:  •  The Group’s significant cash inflow  assumptions particularly, revenue growth  and gross margin;  •  The Group’s planned levels of operational  and capital expenditures, and the ability of  the Group to manage cash outflows within  Our procedures included:  • We analysed the cash flow projections by:  •  Evaluating the underlying data used to  generate the projections.  We specifically  looked for their consistency with the  Group’s intentions, as outlined in  Directors minutes and strategy  documents, and their comparability to  past practices.  •  Analysing the impact of reasonably  possible changes in projected cash flows  and their timing, to the projected periodic  cash positions.  Assessing the resultant  impact to the ability of the Group to pay  debts as and when they fall due and  continue as a going concern.  The specific  areas we focused on were informed from  our test results of the accuracy of  previous Group cash flow projections and  sensitivity analysis on key cash flow  projection assumptions.   •  Assessing the Group’s significant cash  inflow assumptions and judgements for  feasibility and timing.  We used our  knowledge of the Group, its industry, and  customers trends and conditions to  assess the level of associated uncertainty.  •  Assessing the planned levels of operating  and capital expenditures for consistency  of relationships and trends to the Group’s  LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS FY24 HIGHLIGHTS BUSINESS UPDATES SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT CALIX ANNUAL REPORT 2024   76   ===== PAGE 79 ===== INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT  77  available funding; and  • The Group’s plans to reduce level of planned research and development expenditure to address going concern. This included the feasibility, projected timing, quantum of potential savings and status of the proposed plans. In assessing this key audit matter, we involved  senior audit team members who understand  the Group’s business, industry, and the  economic environment it operates in.  historical results ,our understanding of the  business, industry and economic  conditions of the Group.  • We assessed significant non-routine forecast cash inflows and outflows, including the impact of reducing the level of planned research and development expenditure for feasibility, quantum and timing, and their impact to going concern. We used our knowledge of the Group, its industry and status to assess the level of associated uncertainty. • We read Directors minutes and relevant correspondence with the Group’s advisors to understand and the Group’s ability to access additional shareholder funds. • We evaluated the Group’s going concern disclosures in the financial report by comparing them to our understanding of the matter, the events or conditions incorporated into the cash flow projection assessment, the Group’s plans to address those events or conditions, and accounting standard requirements. Share Based Payments ($5,125,000)  Refer to Note 20 to the Financial Report  The key audit matter  How the matter was addressed in our audit  Valuation of share based payments is a key  audit matter due to the size of the balance  relative to the Group's results (being 19.5% of  loss before tax) and the significant effort  required by us to audit the Group’s Employee  Incentive Scheme plan.  The most significant areas of judgement we  focused on was assessing the Group’s:    • Valuation methodology and inputs used by the Group’s external expert in the Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model, such as the grant date, share price at grant date, risk-free interest rate and volatility rate for share options containing market conditions; Our procedures included:  • We considered the appropriateness of the Group's accounting for share based  payment arrangements against the  requirements of the accounting standards. • Read underlying documentation to obtain an  understanding of the contractual nature and  terms and conditions of the share based  payment arrangements. • Tested the inputs used by the Group’s  external expert in the Monte Carlo simulation  option pricing model, such as vesting period,  grant date, share price at grant date and  number of options issued to underlying offer  letters and contracts. • Checked the share price at grant date to the 77  DIRECTORS' REPORT GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT OTHER FY25 PRIORITIES   FINANCIAL REPORT   ===== PAGE 80 ===== INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT              78    •  The probability of achieving the market  conditions that is factored into the grant  date fair value; and   •  The estimated achievement date of  meeting performance against Key  Performance Indicator’s (Gateway 3) and  service conditions for non-market  conditions.

We  compared this to the expected volatility  assumption used by the Group.  •  independently assess and calculate the  fair value of the options at grant date  using a  Monte Carlo simulation option  pricing model for the options that  contain market conditions, with the  publicly available risk-free interest rate,  and the share price and expected  volatility rate from the procedures noted  above. We compared our valuation of  the share options to the fair value  determined by the Group.  •  Recalculated the share based payment  expense over the vesting periods based on the  independently determined fair value as  outlined from the procedures noted above.   We compared this to the share based  payment expense recorded by the Group.  •  Assessed the scope, competence and  objectivity of the external expert engaged by  the Group to assist with the valuation of the  employee incentive scheme options that  contained market conditions granted during  the year.  •  Assessed the probabilities determined by the  Group in achieving market conditions by  retrospectively assessing the share price at  testing date.  •  Assessed the achievement of non-market  vesting conditions against those estimated by  the Group at grant date.     •  Assessed the appropriateness of disclosures  against the requirements of the accounting  standards.

This includes disclosing, as  applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting  unless they either intend to liquidate the Group and Company or to cease operations, or have  no realistic alternative but to do so.     Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Report  Our objective is:  • to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Report as a whole is free from  material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and   • to issue an Auditor’s Report that includes our opinion.   Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in  accordance with Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it  exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in the  aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on  the basis of the Financial Report.  79  DIRECTORS' REPORT GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT OTHER FY25 PRIORITIES   FINANCIAL REPORT   ===== PAGE 82 ===== INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT  LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS FY24 HIGHLIGHTS BUSINESS UPDATES SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT CALIX ANNUAL REPORT 2024   80   ===== PAGE 83 ===== Additional information required by Australian Securities Exchange Listing Rules and not disclosed elsewhere in this report.

Our vision is for Calix to be a leading global innovator of industrial  solutions for the environment.  We are urgently applying our technology to address some of  humanity's greatest challenges in decarbonisation and sustainability.  Sustainability is core to our purpose, and as such, Calix is deeply  committed to furthering our own environmental and social efforts.  Over the past year, Calix has made progress against our  sustainability objectives as we continue to accelerate our impact.  In FY24, we built on our previous greenhouse gas assessment by  strengthening our data collection to complete a more robust and  accurate assessment of our footprint. This has provided improved  insight into where emission hotspots exist within our operations,  enabling us to better target our efforts to minimise emissions.  We also continued to innovate through our technology, making  significant inroads towards providing viable pathways for efficient  processing of low-carbon energy-intensive mineral products and the  capture of unavoidable process emissions across multiple industries.  Our people are vital to our success. Their health and safety is  paramount, and we are continuously improving and identifying  new ways to further support our employees. I am pleased that in  FY24 Calix had no significant injuries, demonstrating our strong  safety culture and performance. We are focused on supporting  the wellbeing of our people, and in the past six months held  psychosocial workshops to gain a deeper understanding of the ways  we can increase support for their mental health. These initiatives  reflect the broader culture we’re building at Calix. I would like to  thank every member of our team for their contribution to creating a  safer, and more inclusive, innovative and sustainable company.  At Calix, we aim to benefit the communities in which we live and  work. In FY24, we continued to partner with organisations enabling  clean water access and reaffirmed our commitment to the United  Nations Global Compact, upholding our commitment to engage in  practices consistent with our values and principles.  The Calix Board of Directors (the Board) maintains a proactive  and careful process of board renewal to ensure the appropriate  composition to support the delivery of Calix’s strategic goals. The  ongoing renewal has resulted in the Board being comprised of seven  directors, including five independent non-executive directors, who  together bring a strong mix of skills, experience, knowledge and  diversity, including gender diversity.  As we near 20 years since our founding as a company in 2005, the  applications and potential impact of our core platform technology  continue to advance. Our technology and purpose-driven approach  will play an increasingly important role as governments, investors,  and customers demand cost-effective and environmentally sound  solutions for the materials of our future economy.  The sustainability outcomes delivered by our technology and,  increasingly our operations, present an opportunity for shared  value creation and better environmental outcomes for all. We are  pleased to share our progress against our internal sustainability  ambitions from the past twelve months. Calix remains steadfast  in our commitment to accelerating action against climate change,  fostering diversity and inclusion, and embedding more sustainable  and responsible business practices throughout our organisation.  Because there is only one Earth.  Phil Hodgson  Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer  03  Introduction — Message from our CEO   ===== PAGE 6 ===== Calix exists to solve global environmental challenges.  In the same spirit, the Company is stepping up its own efforts to  further embed sustainability into its strategic decision-making  in compliance with reporting standards. As Chair of the Board’s  Sustainability Committee, I have the distinct pleasure of working with  fellow members, Calix’s leadership and the broader team to advance  Calix in its own sustainability journey.  In the past year, we have seen the global movement towards  alignment of sustainability reporting standards strengthen.  Sparked by the release of the International Financial Reporting  Standards (IFRS) S1 and S2, Calix is working to enhance our  sustainability strategy, governance, and risk management in line  with the Australian Accounting Standards Board’s (AASB) proposed  Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards (ASRS).  The Company has taken early steps to ensure key elements of the  ASRS are provided in this year’s Sustainability Report. This includes  key metrics such as Calix’s greenhouse gas footprint, covering all  three segmented scopes. The Company is laying the groundwork  for full compliance ahead of the Group 3 FY28 reporting deadline  recommended by the Australian Government’s Treasury.  To this end, Calix commenced an ASRS gap analysis to identify areas  where the Company could improve by incorporating climate and  other material sustainability-related risks and opportunities in its  assessments and governance processes. Further, Calix is currently  evaluating the necessary technology and tools to independently  assure its climate-related disclosures. The culmination of this  work will enable Calix to consider the most impactful topics  to its long-term resilience – informed by science, data and  stakeholder feedback.  We look forward to keeping you informed of our progress towards  our sustainability ambitions.  Helen Fisher  Non-Executive Director and Chair, Sustainability Committee  MESSAGE FROM SUSTAINABILITY  COMMITTEE CHAIR  Calix is stepping up its  own efforts to further  embed sustainability across  company practices.  04  COMMUNITY  SUSTAINABILITY AMBITIONS  APPENDIX  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2024  RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS  INTRODUCTION   ===== PAGE 7 ===== CLIMATE  STATEMENT  Calix recognises the impact climate change will have  on our business, operations and value proposition,  including potential opportunities and risks.  For more information about Calix’s:  – Sustainability strategy and targets, please see ‘Our sustainability ambitions’  – Governance and risk management, please see ‘Responsible business' and our FY24 Corporate Governance Statement  Calix is committed to high standards of corporate governance and transparency.  The Board, with support from the Sustainability Committee, oversees the Company’s  sustainability strategies, policies and initiatives. In tandem, the Audit and Risk  Management, People, Culture and Nominations, and Technology Committees play  an important role in assisting the Board to fulfil its other corporate governance and  oversight responsibilities, including climate and regulatory-related risk management  systems, and embedding Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations  across the Company. Within Calix, we have a dedicated resource to manage our ESG  activities, as well as a group of volunteers from across regions, functions and business  lines drive the implementation of our internal sustainability initiatives (Volunteer  Sustainability Team).  Calix is on a mission to help solve some of the greatest global environmental challenges  of our time, including through the decarbonisation of cement, steel and alumina,  sustainable processing of critical minerals, direct air capture of atmospheric carbon  dioxide (CO2), and sustainable environmental products. Accelerating a just transition to  a carbon-neutral world is both a business and operational priority.  In FY24, Calix completed a more comprehensive greenhouse gas (GHG) assessment,  providing a detailed footprint of the Company’s FY23 emissions. As a result, Calix is  able to report Scope 3 emissions – a key milestone in our commitment to reduce the  Company’s emissions in line with the 1.5 °C degree pathway. The assessment identified  the hotspots in our operations and supply chain, which will inform our emissions  reduction roadmap and activities.  Ahead of the reporting deadline recommended by the Australian Government’s Treasury,  Calix will conduct a materiality assessment and climate scenario analysis to help inform  our strategic areas of focus and feed into our investment decisions and planning. We  expect these exercises will provide the Company with additional, robust insights into  the relevant material climate-related risks and opportunities over the short, medium  and long term, pursuant to the proposed ASRS. We will share the outcomes of these  exercises in forthcoming reports.

Positive impact  Positive impact is what drives us to work every  day. We are driven to use our unique skills to  create truly sustainable industrial practices.  Innovation  Innovation reflects our ability to think from first  principles, to challenge each other, and adapt  quickly to new opportunities.  Resolute  Resolute means we are a purpose-driven  company and determined to make a positive  difference for the long-term.  Inclusive  Fostering a diverse and inclusive culture is  not just a moral imperative; it provides the  foundation for driving innovation and business  success. Diversity is a key focus for our company.  Teamwork  At the foundation of our spirit is teamwork. We  are a down-to-earth, caring, honest, innovative  and dedicated team of people working together  to solve global challenges.  CALIX VALUES  OUR PURPOSE-LED  APPROACH  At Calix, sustainability sits at the  core of our purpose. It guides  our decision-making, shapes our  strategies, and inspires innovation.  As a company working to solve some  of the most pressing and challenging  global issues of our time, we aim to  minimise the negative impacts of our  operations and amplify the positives.  Because Mars is for quitters.  06  COMMUNITY  SUSTAINABILITY AMBITIONS  APPENDIX  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2024  RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS  INTRODUCTION   ===== PAGE 9 ===== Our foundations  In 2005, Calix's founders Connor Horley and Mark Sceats first  embarked on the development of a revolutionary idea for a new  type of kiln. It quickly became apparent the technology had the  potential to be applied across a multitude of industries to help solve  some of the world’s greatest challenges. Through a combination of  rigorous research and development, targeted investment decisions  and funding, and the ingenuity and passion of a dedicated team, the  potential of the Company’s core platform technology is beginning to  be realised. From a single application in wastewater treatment, Calix  now has 28 patent families covering its core platform technology  and applications across a range of industrial decarbonisation,  mineral processing and environmental solutions.  As an environmental technology company, we aim to embed  sustainability considerations into our decision-making. Participating  in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) – the world’s largest  corporate sustainability initiative driving action to support the  achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – means  aligning our practices with the Ten Principles of the UNGC and  working towards the SDGs.  Alignment with the United Nations Global Compact  The SDGs are at the heart of the United Nation’s 2030 Agenda  for Sustainable Development, a shared blueprint for peace and  prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future.  Seventeen integrated goals represent a call to action in critically  important areas for humanity and the planet, such as ending  poverty, improving health and education, reducing inequality, and  preserving nature. Positively impacting one area will benefit another,  spurring further progress needed within the window of opportunity  to prevent the worst impacts of the climate crisis and secure  climate justice.  To reach the SDGs, industries must have a sustainable and  economical pathway towards carbon neutrality and effective  management of our land and water. Just like the UNGC, Calix  recognises the need to balance social, economic and environmental  sustainability. Across the applications of the Company’s core  platform technology, we are providing solutions aligned with  ten SDGs.  Calix’s operations are grounded in the UNGC’s Ten Principles. These  Ten Principles outline the foundation of a principles-based approach  to conducting business: upholding basic responsibilities to people  and the planet while setting the stage for long-term success. By  implementing the Ten Principles, companies avoid undermining the  achievements of the SDGs and contribute to their realisation.  As a signatory of the UNGC, Calix is committed to making the Ten  Principles part of our strategy, culture and operations and taking  action in support of the SDGs. Calix supports and respects the  rights of all humans, upholds ethical and fair labour practices,  aims to operate in an environmentally responsible manner and is  committed to conducting our business and related activities with the  utmost integrity.

Ground minerals float down through externally heated tubes where they  are quickly heated by heat radiated from the tube walls. The indirect  heating process enables clean, efficient and precise electric heating to  replace inefficient combustion and carbon-intensive fossil fuels.  By separating what we heat from how we’re heating it, any carbon  dioxide released directly from the raw material, which is unavoidable  in the making of cement and lime, is kept pure and can be efficiently  captured for use or storage.  For green iron and steel, hydrogen is used to remove oxygen from the  mineral. Hydrogen, however, is not combusted or used as a fuel, and is  easily recycled. This unique feature of the technology aims to enable the  lowest-cost solution for the production of green iron and steel.  Calix’s flash calcination technology can also create high surface area  materials with enhanced chemical and/or bioactivity.  09  Introduction — Creating value and impact   ===== PAGE 12 ===== 2024 ACHIEVEMENTS  WHAT'S NEXT  Science-based emission  reduction in line with the  1.5 °C pathway.  – We built on our previous  greenhouse gas emissions  assessment by strengthening  our data collection to  complete a more robust and  accurate footprint.  – We launched our first Diversity,  Equality and Inclusion (DE&I) series,  facilitating conversations with Calix  and Leilac team members on how to  further representation and equality in  our workplace and our world.  – Achieved gender balance at the  Board level following the Board  renewal process.  – Taking learnings from the  past two assessments, Calix  will complete a full baseline  in the coming year. The FY24  greenhouse gas footprint will  serve as the starting point  for our future progress.  – Calix will develop a reduction  roadmap and begin  addressing some of the  largest sources of emissions  within our operations and  supply chain.  – Following positive feedback from Calix  employees and external stakeholders  on the valuable insights shared  during our DE&I panels, the series  will continue to explore DE&I themes  related to our Company.  – In FY25, Calix will conduct a  remuneration assessment to identify  any internal sources of financial  inequity. The analysis will follow the  implementation of a Human Resource  Management system in early 2025.  – Recognising the sustainability and  commercial benefits that come from  greater diversity, Calix will engage  with female and diverse university  students to foster interest and  attract talent in Science, Technology,  Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).  Gender balance at all levels of  the organisation.  OUR PROGRESS & WHAT’S NEXT  At Calix, sustainability means meeting our  own needs without compromising the ability  of future generations to meet theirs. It is  deeply embedded in our purpose – solving  global challenges.  Together, we are working towards three  ambitious goals by 2030. These goals,  selected by the Volunteer Sustainability  Team, and ratified by the Board, represent  how Calix is addressing some of the most  material risks and opportunities: carbon  emissions, diversity and inclusion, and  environmental impacts.  Address the sustainability of the  materials and resources we use in  our business.  Gender balance at all levels of  the organisation.  Science-based emission reduction in  line with the 1.5°C pathway.  In addition to the Company’s three 2030  sustainability ambitions, the health and  safety of our people continues as always  to be our primary operational focus. Health  and safety is so paramount that it serves as  a gateway to Calix's bonus structure. The  bonus can be awarded only when safety  KPIs are fully met each year.  The following section of the FY24  Sustainability Report outlines the headway  we’ve made over the past year against these  goals and provides a view of the future.  We are pleased to share our progress as  we remain steadfast in our commitment to  building a more sustainable planet.  OUR SUSTAINABILITY  AMBITIONS  AMBITION  10  INTRODUCTION  COMMUNITY  APPENDIX SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2024  RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS SUSTAINABILITY AMBITIONS   ===== PAGE 13 ===== – Following the identification of Calix’s top sources  of emissions – which include the processing and  transportation of our magnesium-based product –  we held internal discussions around how to improve  the way we procure, process, and transport materials  through our value chain.  – The Company also continued to explore ways  to minimise waste from our Intermediate Bulk  Containers (IBCs), which are used to transport  our Magnesium Hydroxide Liquid (MHL) products,  including distributing 38 IBCs for reuse and trialling  cardboard IBCs for recycling.  – Calix commenced the development of an  Environmental Management System (EMS) to help  further identify and manage operational risks related  to the environment.  – In FY25, Calix will explore Lifecycle Assessment  frameworks and tools to support the evaluation  of applications of our core platform technology,  ensuring we optimise the use of material inputs.  – Calix intends to evolve the sustainability strategy and  set clear qualifications for our environmental impact  reduction efforts. In FY25, Calix will analyse site  operations to identify opportunities to further reduce  waste and increase resource efficiencies.  – Building on the framework of the EMS, Calix plans to  introduce a monitoring mechanism of environmental  impact issues and incidents, enhancing the way we  control material environmental risks.  – The Company will begin to incorporate sustainable  procurement practices as new demonstration plants  and facilities are built.  Address the sustainability of the materials and  resources we use in our business.  – Calix introduced monthly company-wide safety updates to foster  communication between the safety team and the wider group.  – To further increase awareness around relevant safety topics, the  Company established noticeboards at each plant site.  – The Company started a safety alert program, issuing safety  alerts with information, including key response actions, following  certain incidents.  – Calix continued to adopt industry best practices by transitioning  from Job Safety Analyses to Safe Work Method Statements – a  key component of Australia’s Work Health and Safety mandate.  – The Company made strong progress enhancing overall safety  reporting, broadening the focus from Calix’s technology centre,  Bacchus Marsh, to the rest of the organisation.  – Calix invested efforts into safety culture, whereby the  executive leadership team conducted walk and talks, incident  investigations and audits with staff with the purpose of  communicating ultimate intent of the activity.  – Calix will roll out an updated Health & Safety management  system, enhancing usability and effectiveness.  Zero harm in the business through a safe  working environment.  11 Sustainability Ambitions — Our progress & what’s next   ===== PAGE 14 ===== MINIMISING IMPACTS ON  THE ENVIRONMENT  DECARBONISATION  Emissions  In FY22, Calix committed to reducing  our GHG emissions in line with the 1.5 °C  pathway set by the 2015 Paris Agreement.  This target follows science-based guidance  of limiting global temperature warming  to a level that avoids the most severe  impact of climate change. As a company  helping hard-to-abate industrial sectors to  decarbonise, Calix is strongly aligned with  this goal. Over the past two years, our team  has worked in earnest under the guidance of  carbon management consultants to gather  the information needed to understand our  GHG footprint. The Company’s FY23 GHG  inventory serves as a starting indicator  of emissions hotspots and persistent  data gaps. We will continue to implement  improvements to both reduce emissions  and aid in data gathering in the months and  years ahead.  As a result of improving the accuracy of  Calix’s Scope 3 data, and the additional  inclusion of the MHL products developed  by our business in the US, the Company’s  estimated GHG footprint for FY23 increased  from FY22. The increase is not a result of  any significant changes in Calix’s operations  or business strategy. We continue to  improve data collection and expect to have  a comprehensive baseline of our FY24  footprint in next year’s report. To ensure our  efforts are at the pace and scale in line with  the Paris Agreement, we intend to pursue  a third-party validated decarbonisation  target following the establishment of our  FY24 baseline.  With oversight from the Board, supported  by the Sustainability Committee, our  Volunteer Sustainability Team is working  across Calix to explore, prioritise and  execute initiatives to drive the reduction of  our GHG footprint.  1. Note: Due to rounding, percentages may not total exactly 100%.  Scope 1 emissions  In FY23, Calix’s Scope 1 emissions were  estimated to be 2,791 tCO2-e, representing  approximately 15.6% of the Company’s total  carbon footprint. These encompass the  direct emissions from Calix’s operations,  such as the burning of natural gas in  magnesite calcination to produce our MHL  products, fuel consumed by Company- owned vehicles and equipment, including  those used at our Myrtle Springs mine site,  as well as the use and leakage of refrigerant  gases at Calix offices and plants.  Scope 2 emissions  In FY23, Calix’s Scope 2 emissions were  estimated to be 587.5 tCO2-e, representing  3.3% of the Company’s total carbon  footprint. These encompass indirect  emissions resulting from Calix’s operations,  such as energy from electricity purchased  for consumption at the Company’s offices  and plants.  Scope 3 emissions  In FY23, Calix’s Scope 3 emissions  were estimated to be 14,558.4 tCO2-e,  representing 81.2% of the Company’s  total carbon footprint. These encompass  indirect emissions resulting from all other  upstream and downstream emissions across  our value chain, such as purchased goods  and services, business travel, and fuel  consumption related to the transport and  operation of stationary equipment.  Scope 3 emissions provide an indication of  the emission sources outside the Company’s  direct control. Calix is not immune to the  data gaps commonly encountered for  these indirect emissions. As part of the  Company’s next GHG footprint assessment,  we will complete another boundary-setting  exercise to expand the scope as well as  work with suppliers to improve our overall  reporting. We also recognise the outsized  impact Calix’s Scope 3 emissions have on  the Company’s emissions footprint and the  particular complexities of reducing these  emissions. Opportunities to improve the  Company’s supplier selection process and  increase supplier engagement are some of  the strategies currently being developed  to reduce Scope 3 emissions in addition to  resolving key data gaps.

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT  Calix is committed to conducting our business in an environmentally responsible  manner, consistent with our Environmental Policy. Beyond reducing our GHG  emissions, we are exploring the broader impact our operations have on the  natural environment, including water, waste and chemicals. Initiatives to  accurately measure these impacts, in addition to actual resource reduction,  are underway.  Calix did not receive any environmental fines (significant or otherwise) in FY24.  The Company manages potential risks, such as an environmental incident,  through our risk management process.

We promote an inclusive and safe space for all and proudly  welcome and support people of any race, ability, gender and  identity. In FY21, Calix's Volunteer Sustainability Team adopted the  UNGC’s Sustainability Development Goal Ambition Benchmark of  achieving gender balance at all levels of management by 2030.  As we acknowledge the benefits of greater gender diversity, we  are taking this ambition further by applying it across all levels of  the organisation. Ensuring a strong pipeline of diverse candidates,  development of talent, and an inclusive culture are strategic  imperatives we believe will benefit Calix’s business, our people, and  the planet.  Our people are essential to delivering  our purpose.  They are scientists, engineers and technical specialists dedicated  to solving global challenges. Calix is continuously developing ways  to support our people, with an unwavering commitment to health  and safety. That commitment extends to all people who interact  with our operations and live in and around the communities in which  we operate.  In FY24, Calix grew its workforce to over 155 people, an increase  of approximately 22% from the prior year. Through our continued  growth we are committed to fostering diversity and a culture  of inclusion, as well as protecting the health and safety of  our workforce.

Topics ranged from promoting female participation in STEM to the connection between  DE&I and sustainability. Recordings of the panel discussions are publicly available via the  Calix and Leilac websites and social media channels. We will continue the series in FY25.  Promoting inclusivity and engagement  At Calix, we endeavour to cultivate a highly engaged and inclusive culture that fosters a  sense of belonging for all employees.  In September 2023, Calix conducted an employee survey with the results highlighting  strong engagement and pride among our people:  Leilac is a global, collaborative  technology partner seeking  to enable a sustainable future  for cement and lime in a  carbon-neutral world. As a mostly  remote work company, Leilac aims  to attract the strongest talent from  all over the globe, using the team’s  unique and diverse backgrounds to  develop innovative decarbonisation  solutions. Together, the Leilac  team speaks over 25 languages  and represents 28 nationalities  from over 13 countries. By  driving innovation, the diversity  and experience of our team are  accelerating the impact we can  have on creating sustainable  industries and helping to avoid the  worst effects of climate change.  SPOTLIGHT –  DIVERSITY AT LEILAC  Areas of improvement identified in the  feedback received from the survey  centered on company systems and  processes and internal communications.  In FY24, Calix appointed its first full-time  General Manager, People & Culture.

Each year, the Board approves Key  Performance Indicators (KPIs) as part of the  Company’s Safety, Health, Environment, and  Quality Action Plan. This acts as the first  performance gateway for the Company’s  Employee Incentive Scheme (EIS), in which  rights or options can only be awarded if  the safety KPIs are achieved for that year.  This mechanism aims to demonstrate Calix’s  commitment to safety at the highest level.  In addition, safety is the first agenda item at  all Board and leadership team meetings. To  further encourage safe work practices and  engagement, actions that contribute to a  positive safety culture are now recognised  at monthly all-staff and site meetings.  The Company’s dedicated Health & Safety  team meets monthly to review incidents,  share findings, and identify actions and  preventative measures, with a targeted  attendance KPI of 80%.  Calix’s commitment to safety and wellbeing  extends to anyone on-site, including people  who conduct contract work. To this end,  Calix is developing a contractor management  procedure that defines the activities required  to successfully and safely engage the  Company’s contractor workforce.  Safety management system  The Calix safety management system, which  covers all Calix-managed work, is grounded  in Calix’s Health, Safety and Environment  (HSE) Manual. The HSE manual links to  all critical and core procedures and their  associated templates, providing simple  access to all documents referenced within  the management system.  Training is an important component of the  broader safety approach to preventing  injury. All employees are required to  complete a safety training induction as part  of the Company’s onboarding process for  new employees. Any operations personnel  must also complete additional training  around manual handling, finger and hand  safety, how to use the safety management  system and report safety incidents.  Calix is dedicated to continuously improving,  with several significant safety system  advancements implemented in FY24 to  enhance suitability and effectiveness.  This redevelopment included a three- month review of all procedures, engaging  stakeholders at every level of the business.  The HSE Manual was updated to divide  processes into two main categories: critical  risk procedures and core procedures.  Critical Risk Procedures  The Critical Risk procedures describe  mandatory processes and controls to  protect people from the high-risk activities  - as defined in regulations - associated with  the work undertaken by Calix employees  and contractors. The procedures have  expanded to include additional high-risk  activities, reflecting Calix’s growth and new  undertakings. Each procedure includes  clearly defined activities and associated  accountabilities, ensuring that individuals  have a clear understanding of their roles and  responsibilities. This resource, along with  custom permit-to-work templates tailored to  each respective high-risk activity, creates the  foundation for effectively managing risks.  Core Procedures  The Core Procedures establish processes  to support the achievement of HSE- related objectives, drive continuous  improvement, and ensure the engagement  and participation of employees and other  stakeholders. Within the Core Procedure  set, Calix’s Creating Safe Work model has  been further developed to define the roles  and responsibilities of the job supervisor  and people doing the work. The model is  a cornerstone of the safety management  system and our operations.  In FY25, Calix will roll out the updated Health  & Safety management system across the  company through robust communications  and training to our workforce.  PROTECTING AND INVESTING IN PEOPLE  18  INTRODUCTION  COMMUNITY  APPENDIX  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2024  RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS  SUSTAINABILITY AMBITIONS   ===== PAGE 21 ===== Calix’s Victoria and Queensland sites  are accredited under ISO 45001, the  International Standard for Work Health  and Safety Systems, encompassing 6 of  the Company’s 14 production plants.  Physical safety  Safety continues to be Calix’s primary  operational focus. All incidents are reviewed,  and depending on their significance, are  investigated and reported to the Board.  Corrective actions are developed and  monitored to prevent recurrence and ensure  continuous improvement in Calix’s safety  management system.  The frequency of near-miss incidents is  regarded by Calix as a positive leading  indicator of safety culture, whereby all  employees are required to, and feel  empowered to, report all safety incidents,  including near misses. The Company  does not have a minimum criterion for  incident reporting. All material reports  undergo detailed investigations, analysing  root causes, sharing learnings across the  business, and where possible, preventative  actions are implemented.  Calix’s dedicated focus on improvement,  using industry best practice, meant that no  lost time injuries occurred in FY24, despite  significant operational activity.

An  internal Psychosocial Health Committee  was consequently formed to develop a  psychosocial health strategy. In FY24, the  Health & Safety Team, in consultation with  the Psychosocial Health Committee, hosted  workshops to gather input from team  members across our functions and regions  to identify opportunities for improvement.  Looking forward, the team will develop  strategies to best address the key risk  areas identified and institute monitoring of  psychosocial health risks to understand how  these risks evolve.  We understand our people are more than  employees, so in FY25, we will develop a  Digital Disconnection Policy to assist our  people in finding balance in their time  management. This is particularly important  for roles that are performed remotely.  A flexible and inclusive work environment  extends to all Calix employees, and  where possible we support our team with  arrangements to be their best at work  and home. This includes flexible working  arrangements, as well as wellbeing and  parental leave in some locations. Parental  leave is offered to primary and secondary  carers, and in FY24, 9 employees took  parental leave with everyone returning to  work following the completion of their leave.  100%  OF EMPLOYEES WHO TOOK PARENTAL  LEAVE RETURNED TO WORK  Employee Assistance Program  To foster continued wellbeing and support  mental health, all employees and their  families can access an independent  Employee Assistance Program (EAP). The  EAP provides confidential support and  counselling in response to the diverse  needs of Calix’s employees, including  personal, family or work-related concerns  affecting an employee or their family’s health  and wellbeing.  1. Per 200,000 hours.  2. Per 200,000 hours. Calix defines a ‘near-miss’ incident as any unsafe act, with no reporting threshold.  3. Per million hours.  HUMAN RIGHTS  Human rights, modern slavery and  child labour  Calix respects human rights as defined  by the United Nations Guiding Principles  on Business and Human Rights and has  implemented the Principles in our operational  policies and procedures. We support the  elimination of all forms of forced and  compulsory labour and the effective abolition  of child labour, modern slavery, and human  trafficking. Calix endeavours to ensure  human rights are strictly upheld throughout  our supply chain and operations. We  intend to continue building on our policies  and engage suppliers to further protect  fundamental human and labour rights.  Part of keeping our people safe  includes managing our plants in a way  that ensures ongoing protection while  working in and around the facility. Some  examples of initiatives implemented in  FY24 at our key technology centre in  Bacchus Marsh, include:  – Updating the Emergency Response  Plan to provide specificity around  appropriate response actions and  the people accountable.  – Adding traffic management  instructions to reduce the potential  for vehicular accidents as well  as revamping the Equipment  Location Map for improved clarity  and accuracy.  – Utilising more tools to convey  potential hazards, such as a site map  displaying active exclusion zones.  FACILITY SAFETY  & MANAGEMENT  19 Sustainability Ambitions — Protecting and investing in people   ===== PAGE 22 ===== An inherent value of Calix  is innovation:  We use first principles  thinking to challenge each  other and adapt quickly to  new opportunities.  CONTINUALLY  INNOVATING  In 2022, we set a goal for ourselves to have 100% sustainable  material inputs that are reusable, renewable and/or recyclable  by 2030. In the coming months, we will refine our broader  sustainability strategy, including our resource consumption  target to improve clarity around how we qualify our waste  reduction ambitions. Addressing our MHL product in Australia  was our starting point. Taking the learnings from the IBCs  pilot, we will continue investigating ways to best minimise the  negative outputs of our operations and amplify the positives.  Beyond MHL, we see opportunities for influence to minimise  waste and emissions, as well as support better socio-economic  outcomes via an innovative delivery model in our other  business lines.  As we move from the pilot phase to demonstration plants  to full-scale commercialisation, Calix recognises the need  to progress our procurement practices. We plan to map  our highest-spend suppliers in order to engage them in  efforts to reduce resource use and ensure human rights are  upheld throughout the supply chain. We will also introduce  sustainability as an evaluation criterion for new product and  supplier assessments. We believe embedding sustainability  throughout our supply chain will be mutually beneficial for Calix  and our stakeholders, helping to support continual innovation  in how our products are made and improving environmental  and socio-economic outcomes from our operations.  INNOVATING WITHIN OUR OPERATIONS  20  INTRODUCTION  COMMUNITY  APPENDIX  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2024  RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS  SUSTAINABILITY AMBITIONS   ===== PAGE 23 ===== Accelerating the transition to net zero  by providing the most compelling  decarbonisation solution for global cement  and lime.  Cement is the key ingredient in concrete, the most consumed  substance on Earth after water 1 . Cement provides the  foundations of modern life. Its production, however, is also  inherently carbon-intensive, accounting for ~8% of global  CO2 emissions 2.  Calix’s subsidiary, Leilac, aims to deliver a low-cost capture  solution for emissions released unavoidably in the production of  cement, without the use of additional chemicals or processes.  The Leilac technology is retrofittable, scalable, and compatible  with low-carbon alternative fuels, electrification and renewable  energy to provide viable solutions for near-zero emissions  cement and lime.  In FY24, Leilac-2 – an EU-funded demonstration project to  capture up to 100,000 tonnes of process CO2 per year – was  relocated to Heidelberg Materials’ cement plant in Ennigerloh,  Germany, following the closure of the Heidelberg Materials  Hannover cement plant. Construction of Leilac-2 is expected to  commence in 2025, following the conclusion of permitting.  Affordable and scalable decarbonisation solutions for cement  can accelerate a just transition to net zero by balancing social,  economic and environmental sustainability.  1. Concrete Future – GCCA 2050 Cement and Concrete Industry Roadmap for Net Zero Concrete.  2. Trends in global CO2 emissions; 2016 Report, The Hague: PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency.  DECARBONISING CEMENT & LIME  Applying the Leilac technology to atmospheric  carbon dioxide removal by Direct Air Capture  in partnership with Heirloom.  To achieve global climate goals, decarbonising alone will not be  enough. Centuries of industrialisation has released excess CO2  into our planet’s atmosphere, and these legacy emissions must  also be mitigated if we are to avoid the worst effects of climate  change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  projects 1-10 billion tonnes of atmospheric CO2 removal per  year is required to limit global warming to 1.5 °C.  Leilac and Heirloom, a Direct Air Capture (DAC) company,  have signed a global and perpetual licence agreement and  collaboration agreement to bring together two complementary  technologies designed to capture and remove CO2 from  the atmosphere. In FY24, extensive testing of the combined  technologies continued, and the development of two DAC  facilities in Shreveport, Louisiana was announced. The facilities  are designed to be capable of jointly removing up to 317,000  tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year – a  significant development in the global effort to address  climate change.  DIRECT AIR CAPTURE  21  Sustainability Ambitions — Continually innovating   ===== PAGE 24 ===== Enabling low carbon, low waste and  value-added mineral products with electric  mineral processing at the mine site.  With increasing demand for the critical minerals needed in a  decarbonising global economy, mineral processing must solve  sustainability challenges across the supply chain.  Calcination is one of the most energy-intensive steps in the  lithium battery materials supply chain. In a Joint Venture (JV)  with Pilbara Minerals (ASX: PLS), Calix is applying its electric  calcination technology to produce a concentrated low- carbon intensity lithium phosphate salt at Pilbara Minerals’  Pilgangoora operation.  The innovative ‘mid-stream’ process is designed to reduce the  carbon-energy intensity of spodumene calcination by more  than 90% when compared with using coal as the primary  source of thermal energy in rotary kiln calcination, and by more  than 80% when compared with the use of natural gas 1 .  Processing critical minerals at the mine site can also enable  enhanced ore recovery and avoid the transport of waste  through the conversion of ores to refined mineral products.  In FY24, the demonstration plant being developed in a JV  with Pilbara Minerals commenced construction, following a  successful Final Investment Decision.  Sustainable processing solutions, such as the production of  low-carbon lithium, have the potential to deliver a significant  reduction in the cost and environmental impact of critical  minerals, adding value to mineral exports and enabling a more  sustainable transition towards net zero.  Producing low-carbon and value-added green  metals through the decarbonisation of iron,  steel and alumina.  The production of iron, steel and aluminium together  account for approximately 11% of direct global greenhouse  gas emissions 1, 2. The processing of iron ore and bauxite to  form steel and aluminium is highly-energy intensive and  conventionally reliant on fossil fuels to power the process. The  iron and steel sector is particularly hard-to-abate, as coal is  also used as a reducing agent to convert iron ore to metallic  iron, as well as an energy source to heat the reaction.  Calix’s Zero Emissions Steel TechnologY (ZESTY) and Zero  Emissions ALumina (ZEAL) technology use renewably powered  electric heating to deliver clean and efficient mineral processing  – decoupling energy intensity from carbon intensity. ZESTY  is also designed to enable the most efficient use possible  of green hydrogen as a reductant, replacing the use of coal  in steelmaking.  In FY24, Calix completed its pilot scale testing of ZESTY and  a Front-End Engineering Design study for a ZESTY green  iron demonstration plant, whilst also progressing engineering  studies for ZEAL calciners.  ENABLING GREEN METALS  TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE CRITICAL MINERALS  1. International Energy Agency, Emissions Measurement and Data Collection for a Net Zero Steel Industry, April 2023.  2 International Energy Agency, Tracking Clean Energy Progress 2023.  CONTINUALLY INNOVATING  Calix’s ZESTY was listed among the top 17 Innovators in the  World Economic Forum’s First Movers Coalition Enabling  Technologies Steel Challenge in FY24.  This recognition is part of First Movers’ broader objective  to catalyse near-zero emission steel innovators –  demonstrating demand signal, triggering commercial  investment, promoting collaboration and identifying  obstacles to decarbonisation in the steel sector.  As essential materials within engineering and construction,  steel and aluminium play crucial roles in supporting  a number of the Sustainable Development Goals.  Decarbonising some of the world’s largest sources of  industrial emissions could add value to local iron ore and  alumina exports, future-proof local production and underpin  sustainable global development.  22  INTRODUCTION  COMMUNITY  APPENDIX  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2024  RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS  SUSTAINABILITY AMBITIONS   ===== PAGE 25 ===== 1. Calix ASX Announcement. FINAL INVESTMENT DECISION FOR MID-STREAM DEMONSTRATION PLANT. 2 Aug 2023.  Reducing waste by enabling the processing of  fine and ultrafine material.  A further advantage of processing minerals at the mine site is  the potential to increase the utilisation of the mineral resource  and reduce waste.  Fines and ultra-fines are the spectrum of the mined material  with a small particle size. Fines are often incompatible with  conventional thermal processing, where flue gases can simply  blow the fine material out of the calciner. Alternatively, fines can  be pelletised or agglomerated, however, this adds a potentially  cost-prohibitive processing step. As a result, fines are often  considered too difficult or expensive to handle and consigned  as waste.  Electric calcination and Calix’s flash calcination technology is  ideally suited to processing small particle sizes, enabling the  use of fines that would otherwise be discarded as waste. As  such, electric calcination at the mine site offers significant  potential to provide greater recovery and utilisation of the  mineral resource.  INCREASED UTILISATION OF MINERAL RESOURCES  Enabling renewably powered industrial  processes and grid-load balancing.  Electric calcination is compatible with intermittent renewable  energy sources, flexible operations and power generation  response to improve energy security and deliver more cost- effective operations.  Calix’s electric calcination technology is designed to enable fast  start-up and shut down, and highly flexible production rates  through a high turndown ratio. By leveraging this capability,  mineral producers can improve the cost-effectiveness of  renewably powered mineral processing by matching output to  demand and renewable energy costs.  For grid-connected facilities, electric mineral processing has  the potential to ramp down production and associated energy  requirements at times of high demand, thereby providing a  valuable load-balancing service to the energy grid. Given the  large energy requirements of industrial alumina or green iron  production, the electrification of such facilities and the use of  demand-side controls have the potential to deliver a valuable  stabilising service to renewably powered grids, complementing  supply-side measures such as battery storage. In turn, this  could support a reduction in grid infrastructure costs and  the inclusion of increased levels of renewable generation into  energy grids.  ELECTRIFICATION OF MINERAL PROCESSING  23  Sustainability Ambitions — Continually innovating   ===== PAGE 26 ===== Unique, bioactive materials to improve crop  protection and fight anti-microbial resistance.  Following many years of antibiotic overuse, antimicrobial  resistance is now a rapidly emerging global crisis. Reducing  reliance on conventional pesticides, biocides and antibiotics  is urgently needed. Calix’s unique non-toxic bioactive  materials show promising potential to suppress pathogenic  microorganisms, insect pests, and marine biofoulants through  a generally non-lethal mode of action with very low resistance  development potential.  In collaboration with Australia’s Cooperative Research Centre  for Solving Antimicrobial Resistance (CRC SAAFE), an ongoing  livestock health project confirmed Calix’s bioactive materials  provide quantifiable control of pathogenic and drug-resistant  animal and human bacteria.  Alternatives to products with lethal modes-of-action in  agriculture can help maintain biodiversity and reduce the risk of  future outbreaks of infectious diseases.  Magnesium-based products for safe,  effective and more sustainable water and  wastewater treatment.  Clean water and sanitation are central to achieving the SDGs.  Currently, 80% of wastewater flows back into the ecosystem  without being treated or reused, while existing water treatment  products, such as caustic soda, can have significant detrimental  environmental impacts 1.  Calix’s magnesium-based products are designed to minimise  the release of hazardous chemicals and materials into our  water systems. In FY24, Calix’s subsidiary, IER, opened two new  hydration facilities in the US to expand the reach of our more  sustainable water and wastewater treatment solutions.  Effective water and wastewater management prevents  pathogens, nutrients and other types of pollution from entering  the environment, protecting freshwater systems, oceans and  human health.  In 2024, Calix’s Australian-based MHL business retained  its ISO 9001 certification, demonstrating the Company’s  continued dedication to the highest standard of product  quality for our customers and the environment. While the  certification applies to our MHL business - representing  21% of our operations - the learnings and best-in-industry  approaches are integrated into our wider approach.  WATER TREATMENT SOLUTIONS  TOWARDS MORE SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE  1. https://www.unwater.org/water-facts/water-quality-and-wastewater  CONTINUALLY INNOVATING  24  INTRODUCTION  COMMUNITY  APPENDIX  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2024  RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS  SUSTAINABILITY AMBITIONS   ===== PAGE 27 ===== As well as urgently developing and deploying our environmental  technology solutions, Calix actively engages with governments,  policymakers and non-governmental organisations around  the world to support effective and impactful collective  climate action. We are pleased to share our experience and  ideas in removing barriers and implementing sector-specific  and cross-cutting strategies for industrial decarbonisation  solutions. We also welcome the opportunity to contribute  towards collaborative efforts to achieve national and global  climate goals.  In FY24, Calix and its subsidiary, Leilac, were pleased to  contribute to government efforts to decarbonise industry  through submissions to the:  – Australian Government’s Carbon Leakage Review  – U.S. Department of Energy’s Request for Information on  Transforming Industry – Strategies for Decarbonization  – U.S. Department of Energy’s Request for Information  Regarding Launching a Responsible Carbon  Management Initiative  – Californian Air Resources Board’s Community Air Protection  Program Draft Blueprint 2.0  – Californian Air Resources Board’s Workshop for Net-Zero  Emissions Strategy for the Cement Sector  In July 2024, Calix was also pleased to respond to the Australian  Government’s Green Metals consultation and Critical Minerals  Production Tax Incentive consultation.  Calix acknowledges the support of government funding,  including from the European Union Horizon 2020 programme,  the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, the Australian  Government’s Modern Manufacturing Initiative, and the  Australian Government Modernisation Fund. Calix’s project  partners were also the beneficiaries of funding from the US  Department of Energy, the State of Louisiana, and the German- Australian HyGate Initiative.  PUBLIC POLICY ENGAGEMENT  25  Sustainability Ambitions — Continually innovating   ===== PAGE 28 ===== COMMUNITY  BENEFITING COMMUNITIES  Beyond the primary goal of GHG emission reduction, decarbonisation projects also have the  potential to deliver local community benefits. Calix’s delivery model for its decarbonisation  technology is designed to augment its projects’ primary objectives and create environmental,  health and socio-economic benefits for local communities.  By providing viable pathways to reach net zero, effective decarbonisation solutions can help  to create economically sustainable local industries in a decarbonising global economy. This  can support the retention of jobs and existing economic activity in a low-carbon economy. At  commercial scale, Calix will deliver its industrial decarbonisation solutions through a blueprint  model that aims to use local firms and local resources. This model is designed to maximise  the scale and speed of our impact, and share the value created by such projects with the  communities in which we operate.  Decarbonisation projects can also support improved environmental and health outcomes  beyond reducing GHG emissions. Switching industrial heat sources from coal and the  combustion of other fossil fuels to renewably generated electricity can deliver improved  air quality to the surrounding communities. Electrification can also reduce fugitive dust  emissions. Unlike other carbon capture solutions, the Leilac technology captures unavoidable  CO2 emissions without the use of additional chemicals or solvents that may otherwise enter  the local environment.  Embedding local community benefits into decarbonisation projects can help unify efforts to  address climate change and climate justice to deliver a just transition to net zero.  In FY24, Calix developed Community Benefit Plans for multiple projects. These plans embed  the delivery of community benefits in the objectives and budget of projects. They include  plans to establish community advisory panels to promote engagement with and feedback  from the local community; suggested local procurement, training and hiring targets that  include diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility considerations; and public outreach that  aims to raise awareness and foster acceptance of decarbonisation technologies.  UNITED STATES  Shreveport, Louisiana  In June 2024, Heirloom and Leilac  announced the construction of two major  DAC facilities in Northwest Louisiana.  With support from the U.S. Department  of Energy and the State of Louisiana, the  facilities will contribute to local economic  benefits and job creation – expecting to  create at least 1,000 construction jobs and  over 80 permanent jobs. The local benefits  that Heirloom’s facilities can deliver is  enhanced by Calix’s delivery model – using  industry partners and local resources – in  support of a just transition to sustainable  local industries.  Solutions that decarbonise industrial facilities and remove excess CO2 from the  atmosphere have the potential to deliver significant local community benefits in  addition to effective decarbonisation, including:  – Regional and permanent job creation  – Protection of economies historically reliant on local industrial activity  – Improved environmental and health benefits from reduced or even eliminated  emissions and pollutants released to the surrounding area  – Reduced global CO2 emissions and increased supply chain resilience through  sustainable local manufacturing  – Load balancing support for the local electricity grid, enabling increased  incorporation of renewable energy generation and lower costs.  26  INTRODUCTION  SUSTAINABILITY AMBITIONS  APPENDIX  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2024  RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS  COMMUNITY   ===== PAGE 29 ===== OUR PARTNERSHIPS  Calix aims to closely align our philanthropic support with our business objectives,  benefiting the communities and environments in which we operate.

SUSTAINABILITY IS IN OUR DNA 17  ===== PAGE 18 ===== LETTERS TO SHAREHOLDERS 18  ===== PAGE 19 ===== Peter Turnbull AM Non-Executive Chair A message from the Chair I am pleased to present the Calix Limited Annual Report for the 2023 Financial Year (FY23). Calix has continued to gather momentum, propelled by Environmental, Social and Governance  (ESG) tailwinds, as the world focuses its attention on escalating climate change realities and  the urgent need for widespread global decarbonisation. Despite the slowdown in global growth  driven by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, war in Ukraine, significant inflationary pressures  and supply chain disruptions, the interest, commitment and capital available for solutions that  align with ESG goals (particularly those that will assist governments, industry and investors to  meet their net zero commitments) continue to grow very substantially.  Groundbreaking policies to drive decarbonisation were announced across the planet in FY23,  including: • a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism and Net-Zero Industry Act in Europe; • the Inflation Reduction Act and Regional Direct Air Capture hubs in the USA; and • Safeguard Mechanism, Powering the Regions Fund, National Reconstruction Fund, and Critical      Minerals Strategy in Australia.   These policies recognise the need for urgent, affordable and scalable solutions that balance  social, economic and environmental sustainability to solve some of the greatest global  challenges of our time.  Calix is urgently developing great businesses with the potential to enable: the electrification of  industries; efficient capture of unavoidable emissions; and new sustainable industrial processes.  Despite an otherwise uncertain global economic outlook, I firmly believe that Calix is well placed  to thrive as the Group works towards progressing its core purpose.  ''Groundbreaking policies to drive decarbonisation were  announced across the planet in FY23'' 19  ===== PAGE 20 ===== Strong balance sheet propels investment in growth and  commercialisation In FY23, Calix achieved a gross profit of $6.2m, up from $5.2m in the 2022 Financial  Year (FY22). An increase in sales revenue to $29.6m, compared with $20.8m in FY22,  was supported by new sales within existing regions of Calix’s Water business, as well  as new sales regions across the USA.  Throughout FY23, Calix continued its planned investment in people, plant and  equipment to enhance and accelerate technology development, including a new  laboratory at Bacchus Marsh in Victoria, and professional services to advance  commercialisation. Some of this investment has been supplemented by grants and  tax rebates from governments in the various countries in which we operate. A $60.0m  private placement in October 2022 and a $21.6m Share Purchase Plan, which was  completed in November 2022 with strong support from our existing shareholders,  will provide ongoing capital and balance sheet strength to pursue our strategic  objectives.  Leilac  Calix’s CO2 mitigation line of business, Leilac, exists to accelerate the transition to  net zero by developing the most efficient and effective solution for the abatement  of industrial and atmospheric CO2. It has continued a significant transformation in  FY23 as it continued to commercialise and scale its technology for cement and lime  decarbonisation. This follows an investment in Leilac from one of the world’s leading  decarbonisation investors, Carbon Direct, of €15m in September 2021 for a 6.98%  stake to accelerate the deployment of the Leilac technology. Key commercialisation milestones during the financial period include: • Leilac signed a global licence agreement with Heidelberg Materials (FWB: HEI); • three projects with CEMEX S.A.B. de C.V. (NYSE: CX) were announced in Germany,  Poland and the USA; and • a zero-emissions lime project with Tarmac, a CRH company (LON: CRH, NYSE: CRH)  passed the due diligence phase of the UK Government’s Industrial Carbon Capture  funding scheme. In FY23, Leilac also announced the application of the Leilac technology for Direct Air  Capture (DAC) in a partnership with DAC company, Heirloom. The partnership aims  to integrate Leilac’s electric kiln technology into Heirloom’s DAC process for removal  of atmospheric CO2. Leilac’s pipeline of projects continues to grow, accelerated by  the decarbonisation commitments made by industry and governments, and societies’  ongoing reliance on cement and lime which will be a long-term need.    Sustainable Processing Calix’s patented core technology platform is designed to help mineral and chemical  processing enter the electric age. The Australian Government’s Australian Renewable  Energy Agency (ARENA) announced a $947,000 grant in November 2022 to  support the design of a renewably powered direct hydrogen reduced iron (H-DRI)  demonstration plant. Testing and design work for the 30,000 tonne per annum zero  CO2 emissions ZESTY iron plant continues, with a Front-End Engineering and Design  study expected to be completed by the end of calendar year 2023.  Initial pilot-scale  testing showed excellent metallisation of a range of iron ore types with ZESTY. In November 2022, Calix executed a joint venture with Pilbara Minerals (ASX: PLS)  to develop a novel mid-stream lithium processing technology to produce low carbon,  low waste, and high value lithium salt. The joint venture made significant progress  during FY23 on the detailed engineering and design of a demonstration plant that  aims to utilise Calix’s electric calcination technology at Pilbara Minerals’ Pilgangoora  Project with support from an Australian Government grant of $20m. We were pleased  to announce in August 2023 the Financial Investment Decision to proceed with the  project. In response to significant market demand, Calix is continuing to explore  multiple further applications of its electric calcination technology, including for other  critical minerals and alumina. 20  ===== PAGE 21 ===== Advanced Batteries Calix is pioneering a renewably powered, energy efficient and low-cost chemistry  agnostic platform technology to produce high-performance nanostructured battery  materials. In FY23, the team produced commercial-prototype Lithium Manganese  Oxide (LMO) battery cells in collaboration with UK production partner, AMTE (LON:  AMTE), demonstrating Calix LMO’s high-power capabilities. Calix also expanded its battery production capability to new chemistries favoured  by the electric vehicle segment of the battery market. As the global transition to  electric vehicles and energy grids powered by renewables and storage accelerates,  demand for affordable, more sustainable lithium-ion battery materials with superior  performance and safety is growing. By 2030, global battery capacity is expected  to grow more than fivefold with an estimated total addressable market of over  US$400b. Biotech Calix’s Biotech business is developing high surface area magnesium oxide materials  with high bioactivity for target applications in agriculture, marine and antimicrobial  resistance (AMR). In agriculture, additional field trials are underway to extend the  registration label of Calix’s crop protection product, BOOSTER-Mag. In the marine sector, Calix successfully completed tests with leading global  coatings firms, with further tests and coatings formulation work underway in  at sites across North America, Australia, NZ and Asia. In FY23, Calix became a  Tier 1 partner in Australia’s Cooperative Research Centre Solving Antimicrobial  Resistance in Agribusiness, Food, and Environments (CRC SAAFE), with the first  project underway, studying the application of Calix bioactive materials in intensive  livestock. AMR is internationally recognised as a global crisis, projected to cost the  global economy US$100 trillion and cause 10 million deaths per year by 2050, thus  requiring urgent solutions. Water Water and wastewater management is a challenge that can threaten vital  waterways, impacting health and the environment. Calix’s magnesium oxide  materials provide safe, more effective, economical and sustainable solutions for the  treatment of water and wastewater.  New product development has helped to secure new business within existing  hydration plant regions in the Pacific Northwest and Upper Midwest of the United  States. Revenue growth of 14.2% coupled with strong margins led to a gross profit  increase of 28.6%. Revenue growth accelerated during the year, with growth in the  second half of FY23 up 28% compared with the same period in FY22. Regulatory tailwinds in North America continue to drive growth in the magnesium  hydroxide market.  In FY23, significant progress was made in building two new hydration plants in  Ripon, Wisconsin and Lufkin, Texas, with both new plants expected to commence  operations by the end of 2023.  21  ===== PAGE 22 ===== Continuous improvement in ESG practices As Calix endeavours to solve critical environmental global challenges, we are also  making progress towards greater sustainability in our own operations, delivering  continuous improvement in our internal ESG practices. In November 2022, Calix  reaffirmed its commitment to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) – the  world’s largest sustainability initiative – of which Calix has been a participant since  2020. The UNGC and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) continue as guiding  beacons for Calix’s sustainability journey. In FY23, the board established a new Sustainability Committee. In addition  to updating the Board Charter and Code of Conduct Policy, we replaced the  Remuneration and Nomination Committee with a new People and Culture Committee  and charter, and updated charters for the Audit and Risk Committee, and Technology  Committee. Also, during the financial period, we completed our inaugural greenhouse  gas assessment, which is providing an accurate and transparent foundation on which  Calix will develop an emission reduction roadmap for its operations and supply chain  in FY24.    Complemented by various initiatives to foster health, wellbeing, diversity and  inclusion, the safety of Calix’s employees continues to be our primary operational  focus. All injuries, incidents, investigation outcomes and near-misses are reported  to the board, demonstrating a strong reporting culture, as we, of course, work to  prevent reoccurrence and improve safety in general. We continue to foster a forward- looking preventive culture and seek to learn from all relevant incidents and safety  related events. People development and culture Calix has a dynamic workforce spread across many countries. We understand that our  people drive our performance. Calix fosters a culture of providing on-going personal  and career development opportunities to our workforce, as well as a framework  of close communication and listening with our workforce. As we grow rapidly, we  continue to focus on building a collaborative, diverse and supportive culture across  the whole team around the world. Proactive board succession and renewal Over the last few years, the board has continued to maintain a proactive approach  to board succession and renewal, with the goal of ensuring the size and composition  of the board is appropriate to support the continued delivery of Calix’s growth  strategies, as well as being positioned to meet prevailing best practice governance  standards.   As part of this process, in February 2023, Calix announced the appointment of Alison  Deans as a Non-Executive Director and the retirement of Non-Executive Director, Dr.  Jack Hamilton from the Calix board of directors. Representing the next stage of the  board renewal process, Alison Deans’ appointment, in addition to further renewal  being planned, will strengthen the collective skills and experience of the Calix board.  On behalf of the board of directors and the whole Calix team, I would like to express  my sincere gratitude to Jack Hamilton for his substantial and valuable contribution to  Calix over many years. His commitment and wise counsel have provided considerable  benefit to the Group. We all wish him well in the future.  We expect to make further announcements in relation to board renewal and  expansion in the near future.     On behalf of the board of directors, I would like to thank Calix’s customers and  partners for their continued commitment and collaboration as we work together  to solve global challenges. The board also sincerely thanks all Calix’s employees  and contractors for their tireless efforts, talent and unwavering commitment to our  purpose and goals. We enter FY24 with significant ambitions to continue to progress  our key projects and develop and commercialise the next applications of Calix’s  remarkable core technology platform. It is thanks to the depth and breadth of our  growing team and our network of collaborative partners that we can hope to realise  the potential we see.   Finally, we would like to thank our Calix shareholders for their vital and ongoing  support, and we look forward to keeping you informed of Calix’s progress across  FY24. Peter Turnbull AM Non-Executive Chair 22  ===== PAGE 23 ===== Phil Hodgson    Managing Director  and CEO A message from the CEO As outlined in the Chair’s message, against a background of some financial turbulence,  the strength of the global thematic of decarbonisation of industry continues to grow. We  successfully raised capital in November 2022 to invest in the opportunities this presents for  Calix, and we have done so. Our biggest investment in the 2023 financial year (FY23) has been in our team, which has  grown by 61 full-time positions to 129, including 37 new engineers and scientists, to support  research, development, and the delivery of a growing number of projects and opportunities.  Our people, from our newest recruits to those who have been on the journey from the start,  are consistent in their determination to make a positive difference for the longer-term,  coupled with a sense of urgency. It’s a mindset that aligns with our values, is the core of our  success to date, and will continue to drive our success into the future. ''Our biggest investment in the 2023 financial year (FY23)  has been in our team, which has grown by 61 full-time  positions to 129.'' 23  ===== PAGE 24 ===== Accelerating commercialisation to address global challenges The 2022 financial year marked the first realisation of our strategy to seek equity  directly into our subsidiary businesses to focus on rapid commercialisation, with  the partial spin out of our cement and lime decarbonisation business, Leilac. In  FY23, we have started to realise the benefits we anticipated from such a strategy,  with the investment enabling significant growth in a specialist cement and lime  decarbonisation focused team. This has resulted in a rapid project pipeline build.  Leilac’s licence agreement with Heidelberg Materials (FWB: HEI), three projects with  Cemex S.A.B. de C.V. (NYSE: CX) and another with Tarmac (LON: CRH, NYSE: CRH),  plus a new partnership with Direct Air Capture company, Heirloom are all examples of  our strategy in action.   Our joint venture with Pilbara Minerals (ASX: PLS) passed another significant  milestone in August 2023, with a positive Financial Investment Decision from the  boards of both companies. The decision follows the official formation of the joint  venture in November 2022. A demonstration plant, using Calix’s patented electric  calcination technology, aims to significantly reduce carbon emissions and waste, while  producing small but commercial quantities of a concentrated sustainable lithium salt  product. We believe it’s a compelling proposition for the lithium industry, creating  environmental and economic value, and rationalising supply chains for key battery  markets in Europe and the US.  Our water business continued a very positive growth trend that started after the  impact of the COVID-19 pandemic subsided. Despite the delays in deployment of new  manufacturing facilities, largely resulting from the pandemic, they are now nearly  ready to launch into two significant markets in Texas and Wisconsin, where we have  already started seeding sales. We remain excited by the organic growth potential in  the US, especially as regulations tighten on wastewater discharge. We will remain  focused on this in the 2024 financial year (FY24). The next big opportunities While we progress direct sales in water, and licensing, joint ventures and spin-out  strategies to expedite the commercialisation of cement, lime and lithium, Calix’s next  big opportunities are developing rapidly. Driven by our talented team of scientists  and engineers, and supported by collaborations and partnerships with academia and  industry, we are developing our Zero Emissions Steel TechnologY or “ZESTY”, and  more recently accelerating new applications such as alumina, in response to policy  change and market demand. They represent significant opportunities. We also commissioned our new laboratory at our Bacchus Marsh facility in Victoria,  Australia to significantly increase our capability and capacity to assess new  opportunities for the core technology. To date, this area has been a bottleneck in  our growth, as inbound interest has far exceeded our assessment capacity. We will  continue to invest in increasing our assessment capacity in FY24 in response to this  demand.  Fuelling delivery Calix’s strong balance sheet continues to provide the capacity to pursue  commercialisation opportunities across the breadth of the Company’s business.  It is the result of solid revenue and margin growth in our water business in the US,  grants and tax rebates from government, and ongoing fiscal prudence. It was further  bolstered by the capital raised through a private placement and share purchase plan  in late 2022. By design, we retain flexibility to pursue the right capital strategy for  each investment opportunity across the business.  Looking ahead In FY23 an unprecedented array of government policies and programs were  announced across the planet to support governments, industries and communities  to decarbonise and meet net-zero commitments. For Calix, these policies and  programs were complemented by demand from industry and investors, despite the  turbulent global economic environment. The favourable tailwinds generated by the  pursuit of environment, social and governance goals, combined with Calix’s business  strategy, talented people and solid balance sheet see Calix well positioned for another  landmark year in FY24.   In FY24, our primary focus will continue to be developing and applying our core  platform technology to multiple industrial decarbonisation challenges. We will  progress various key projects through important engineering milestones, including  the commencement of civil works for Leilac-2 and construction of the demonstration  plant at Pilbara Minerals’ Pilgangoora project. We will also urgently develop emerging  opportunities, such as electrification of alumina refining, and aim to demonstrate the  potential for a more sustainable and cost-effective production process for cathode  active materials used in lithium-ion batteries. In FY24, Calix will combine its water and biotech businesses into a consolidated  “Magnesia” line of business. This change is designed to increase the focus, scale and  reach of Calix’s magnesium-based products to help drive new revenues and support  future growth opportunities.   I would like to thank the Calix board for its strategic guidance throughout FY23. I  would also like to thank our customers and partners for their ongoing collaboration,  and the dedication and support they continue to provide to help us achieve our  vision. I would especially like to recognise and thank our people for their unrelenting  commitment and drive towards realising our purpose. It is a remarkably talented and  determined team. Finally, I would like to thank our shareholders for their continued  support and belief in the Company. We look forward to significantly progressing our businesses in FY24.

The combined focus on people and the  Company’s ongoing fiscal prudence has  enabled Calix to grow multiple successful  lines of business simultaneously into large  addressable markets. Support for decarbonisation investment The Company’s investment costs in people  and technology development – specifically  R&D and engineering capability – have  been partly offset by $10.7m in FY23 in  grants and tax rebates from governments  in the various jurisdictions in which we  operate. Broader support for decarbonisation  investment was also demonstrated by a  $60.0m private placement in October  2022 and a $21.6m Share Purchase Plan  completed in November 2022. Strong balance sheet Calix’s strong balance sheet, including its  cash position and minimal debt, provides  the capacity to pursue commercialisation  opportunities across the Company’s  multiple lines of business.  The Company has retained the flexibility to  pursue the right capital strategy for each  investment opportunity across its lines of  business. Solid revenue and margin growth New sales within the existing hydration  plant regions of our Water business in the  Pacific Northwest and Upper Midwest of  the US have driven revenue growth in the  US of 14% for the full year, with second  half growth of 28% compared with the  second half of FY22. Gross margin has also  improved, increasing from 28% to 33%.   Investing for growth 29  ===== PAGE 30 ===== FY23 KEY PROJECTS 30  ===== PAGE 31 ===== A demonstration plant that aims to use Calix’s patented electric calcination technology to produce  a concentrated sustainable lithium product passed its financial investment decision in August 2023.                 The innovative ‘mid-stream’ refining process is being developed in a joint venture between Calix and  Pilbara Minerals (ASX: PLS) and is supported by $20m in Australian Government funding. A step closer   to sustainable lithium  31  ===== PAGE 32 ===== Calix’s electric processing  technology  The proposed mid-stream refining  plant is designed to show the potential  for renewably powered processing of  spodumene at the mine site. With a  full production capacity of more than  3,000 tonnes per year of concentrated  lithium-phosphate salt product, from a  feedstock of around 27,000 tonnes per  year of spodumene – including lower  grade fine spodumene concentrate                     – the project aims to demonstrate: · Reduced carbon intensity                                   – electrification of the mid-stream  process, including spodumene calcining,  can enable the use of up to 100%  renewably sourced power and deliver  a vast reduction in carbon emission  intensity of the lithium product. · Reduced waste – a concentrated  and near zero-waste lithium product  would allow waste material to be left  at the mine site, providing further  cost and emissions savings through  reduced and simplified transport  and logistics.  · Reduced cost – lower capital and  operating costs with Calix’s electric  calciner compared with conventional  calcining processes. · Value add – a lithium rich product  produced at the mine site may  enable more value to be captured  onshore at the mineral resource. 32  ===== PAGE 33 ===== Enabling low-carbon lithium  Life Cycle Assessment studies commissioned by Pilbara  Minerals analysed the carbon footprint of the proposed  mid-stream lithium phosphate salt product, in addition to  comparing β-spodumene produced via electric calcination  and conventional rotary kiln calcination5.   The study found that electric calcination powered entirely  by renewable electricity would reduce the carbon emissions  intensity of spodumene calcination by more than 90%  compared with a conventional coal-fired rotary kiln, and by  more than 80% when compared with natural gas.  Significant emissions reductions are also anticipated from  the mid-stream product by avoiding the transport of waste  associated with spodumene concentrate. Current practices  involve shipping spodumene that is approximately 6% lithium  and 94% waste from the mine site to be processed overseas.  Production of a zero waste, concentrated lithium phosphate  product would further reduce aggregate emissions across  the lithium supply chain.  5Based on cradle-to-gate Life Cycle Assessment studies completed by Minviro Ltd.:  evaluating production of Lithium Hydroxide Monohydrate (LHM) from Pilgangoora  spodumene concentrate using conventional calcination; and evaluating the production  of lithium phosphate from Pilgangoora spodumene concentrate using Calix’s electric  calcination technology.  The assessments calculated the carbon footprint for the  production of each chemical from the mine to the factory gate. A further study  evaluated the product carbon footprint of β-spodumene production via conventional  and electric calcination.  Mid-Stream Demonstration Plant location and layout. Depiction of a 3.1MW Calix electric calciner for a mid-stream lithium  processing demonstration plant. 33  ===== PAGE 34 ===== Rationalising international supply chains  Demand for lithium to support the rapidly growing  global battery market continues to intensify. With the  battery market now expected to grow five-fold by 20306,  governments around the world are seeking to develop  sovereign capabilities and reliable supply chains.  Electrification of mineral processing and the use of  locally sourced renewable energy offers significant  opportunities for Australian producers to develop highly  competitive and future-proof downstream processing  solutions. By doing so, producers could add value to  minerals by converting low-value ores into high-value  products, reducing emissions and rationalising supply  chains.    Commercialisation to the global spodumene  industry  Calix and Pilbara Minerals aim to develop an innovative  pathway for Australia to become a reliable supplier of  sustainably refined lithium to the world. Successful  demonstration of the mid-stream process may lead to its  commercialisation, with the joint venture able to license  the technology to Pilbara Minerals’ commercial scale  plants and the global spodumene processing industry.   “Calix is delighted to have successfully passed  the Financial Investment Decision milestone for a  sustainable lithium demonstration plant developed  in our joint venture with Pilbara Minerals.

The industry accounts for ~7-9%  of global CO2 emissions, with the  majority resulting from the use of  metallurgical coal in the reduction       of iron ore to metallic iron7.   ZESTY is designed to enable direct  hydrogen reduction of iron ore  (H-DRI) in a renewably powered  reactor to produce green iron and  ultimately, green steel. It provides  the potential for a zero-carbon  route to iron and steel that can help  add value to local iron ore exports,                            future-proof local iron and steel  production, and support sustainable  global development. 7Climate change and the production of iron and steel.                 World Steel Association. 2021 38  ===== PAGE 39 ===== Process flow diagram for ZESTY green steel production. Electrification-ready ZESTY’s indirect heating approach is  well suited for electrification, including  with renewable and intermittent energy  sources. Electrification also means no  combustion. With ZESTY, hydrogen is  consumed only as a reductant, not as  a fuel, and can be simply recycled in  the process. This key feature enables  ZESTY to target the most efficient and  economical use possible of hydrogen. 39  ===== PAGE 40 ===== Pilot results Pilot-scale testing shows that Calix’s ZESTY  technology can produce a H-DRI product approaching  commercial grade. Excellent metallisation was achieved for Siderite and  Goethite / Hematite ores. ZESTY’s compatibility with  small particle sizes was found to facilitate fast rates  of metallisation, allowing for significantly shorter  residence times and lower temperature operation than  a conventional blast furnace. Hematite makes up 96%  of Australia’s exported iron ore8 and is not otherwise  suited to most electric arc furnace (EAF) methods. Reduction and metallisation extents for the                       non-porous and dense magnetite sample were lower,  reaching a maximum metallisation degree of 54%  at 1050°C. An increase in residence time and/or  temperature for the processing of dense, non-porous  magnetite samples is expected to lead to improved  reduction and metallisation of magnetite by ZESTY.

Business overview Cement and lime provide the foundations of our societies and economies.  They are also amongst the largest industrial contributors to climate change,  accounting for approximately 8% of global CO2 emissions9. Leilac’s technology is purpose built to efficiently capture unavoidable process  CO2 emissions from cement and lime production, without additional chemicals  or processes. It is designed to be scalable, retrofittable, energy agnostic and  electrification ready to provide flexible and economical pathways to sustainable  industry.  Leilac’s technology is also being developed to deliver zero emissions lime for  capture of emissions from other hard-to-abate sectors, as well as Direct Air  Capture of CO2 from the atmosphere. Market trends Government policies and industry commitments continue to drive industrial  decarbonisation across the globe.  In Europe, the emissions trading scheme reached over €100 per tonne of CO2,  up from less than €20 only three years ago. A Carbon Border Adjustment  Mechanism was introduced, placing a carbon tariff on imported  carbon-intensive products, such as cement. As part of the Green Deal  Industrial Plan, the EU also introduced the Net-Zero Industry Act. The Act identifies carbon capture and storage as one of eight strategic net-zero  technologies and includes a target to develop 50 million tonnes of annual CO2  storage capacity in the EU by 2030.  In the United States, the landmark Inflation Reduction Act was passed,  representing the largest climate investment in US history. It included an increased incentive of US$85 per tonne to capture and permanently store  industrial CO2.  FY23 achievements Leilac signed its first global licence agreement in October 2022 with  Heidelberg Materials, one of the world’s largest cement companies. In an  industry first, Leilac will earn a royalty fee based on a percentage of the value  of CO2 captured by its technology. The perpetual agreement applies to any  Heidelberg Materials facility where the Leilac technology is installed.   Leilac’s growing pipeline of projects include three projects announced by  Cemex and a zero-emissions lime project with Tarmac, which passed the due  diligence phase of the UK Government’s Industrial Carbon Capture funding  scheme. In FY23, Leilac also announced a partnership with Direct Air Capture (DAC)  company, Heirloom. The partnership aims to integrate Leilac’s electric kiln  technology into Heirloom’s DAC process for removal of atmospheric CO2.  A signed Memorandum of Understanding outlines the key terms for a global  licence and collaboration agreement.  FY24 priorities  1. Complete permitting and civil works for Leilac-2. 2. Progress projects through the Leilac project pipeline. 3. Complete the Basis of Design for the green methanol  consortia project. 9Trends in global CO2 emissions; 2016 Report, The Hague: PBL Netherlands Environmental   Assessment Agency 45  ===== PAGE 46 ===== “Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) plays a major role in  decarbonizing the industry sector in the context of 1.5°C  and 2°C pathways, especially in industries with higher  process emissions, such as cement.”          SR1.5.

SDG Impact 46  ===== PAGE 47 ===== Sustainable Processing Business overview Calix’s patented core platform technology aims to help mineral and chemical  processing enter the electric age. An indirect radiative heating approach separates the heat source from the chemical reaction and removes the need for combustion. Compatible with renewable sources of energy and grid-load  balancing applications, Calix’s technology is also designed to enable efficient  use of green hydrogen in place of conventional, carbon-intensive reductants. Calix’s innovative mineral processing solutions are designed to enhance  recovery of ore and create near zero-waste products. At-mine processing has  the potential to rationalise supply chains, reduce the total CO2 footprint of  minerals, and add value to mineral exports. Market trends Critical minerals essential to a decarbonising global economy were the source  of significant geopolitical interest in FY23, as governments sought to develop  sovereign capabilities and reliable supply chains. The US-Australia Climate, Critical Minerals and Clean Energy Transformation  Compact was announced. It aims to fast-track critical mineral supply chains  and provide access to US capital for Australian companies. In Europe, the  Critical Raw Materials Act also aims to diversify and enhance the resilience of  EU critical raw material supply chains. In Australia, the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund includes up to  $3 billion for renewables and low emission technologies and $1 billion for  value-adding in resources. An additional $400m was announced for Critical  Inputs for Clean Energy Industries, such as steel, cement and lime, and alumina. FY23 achievements FY23 saw considerable focus on the development of Calix’s Zero Emissions  Steel TechnologY (ZESTY). A $947,035 grant from the Australian Government’s  Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) is supporting the design of a  renewably powered direct hydrogen reduced iron (H-DRI) demonstration plant.  Initial pilot-scale testing showed excellent metallisation of a range of iron ore  types with ZESTY. The ongoing R&D program is informing a Front-End  Engineering Design (FEED) study for the 30,000 tonne per annum, zero CO2  emissions ZESTY-iron demonstration plant. In November 2022, Calix executed a joint venture with Pilbara Minerals to develop a novel mid-stream lithium processing technology to produce low carbon, low waste, and high value lithium salt. The joint venture made significant progress during FY23 on the detailed engineering and design of a  demonstration plant that aims to utilise Calix’s electric calcination technology  at Pilbara Minerals’ Pilgangoora Project. The proposed demonstration plant is  supported by a $20m grant under the Australian Government’s Modern  Manufacturing Initiative. In response to significant market demand, Calix continued to explore and develop further applications of its sustainable processing technology, including  to other critical minerals and alumina. FY24 priorities  1.	 Commence the construction of the demonstration plant at  Pilbara Minerals’ Pilgangoora project. 2.	Expand ZESTY’s ore testing program. 3.	Complete a FEED study for the ZESTY demonstration plant. 4.	Complete a pre-FEED study for Alumina.   47  ===== PAGE 48 ===== To reach the Sustainable Development Goals on climate  change and clean energy, hard-to-abate sectors of  our industry that traditionally rely on carbon intensive  heating sources and feedstocks must become compatible  with clean alternatives. Calix’s technology is energy agnostic and  electrification-ready, providing sustainable and  economical pathways for industrial processes to  transition to clean energy sources, including renewable  electricity. From electrification, to enabling green steel through  hydrogen reduction, to reducing the waste and CO2  footprint of mineral processing with innovative refining  solutions, Calix is enabling sustainable industrial  processing. SDG Impact 48  ===== PAGE 49 ===== Advanced Batteries Business overview As the global transition to electric vehicles and energy grids powered by  renewables and storage gathers pace, demand for lithium-ion battery materials  is growing. In a decarbonising global economy, advanced battery materials will  need to deliver superior performance and safety, while reducing costs and environmental impact. Calix is pioneering a renewably powered, energy efficient and low-cost  chemistry agnostic platform technology designed to produce sustainable  high-performance nanostructured battery materials. Market trends Growth in the global battery market is outpacing previous projections.  By 2030, global battery capacity is now expected to grow more than five fold to 5,500 GWh, reaching a market value of over US$400b10.  Government policies, such as the US Government’s US$369b Inflation  Reduction Act and the European Critical Minerals Act, are driving efforts to  build sovereign capabilities and supply chains. This has increased demand  for localised, high quality and sustainable battery material production.  FY23 achievements In FY23, the Advanced Batteries business successfully produced 4Ah  commercial-prototype battery cells using Calix Lithium Manganese                            Oxide (LMO) cathode powder, in collaboration with UK production partner,  AMTE Power. Additionally, Prototype Single Layer Pouch (SLP) cell testing                 demonstrated Calix LMO’s impressive high-power capabilities.  Improvements to Calix’s high-power LMO cathode materials continued,  including enhanced long-term cycling stability. Calix also continued its  productive collaboration with Deakin University, including material testing with their BatTRI-Hub pilot-scale production line and an agreement for further  testing with the Deakin Recycling and Clean Energy Commercialisation Hub  (REACH).  Informed by continuous engagement with key players in the battery market,  the high-power battery segment (for applications such as power-tools,  industrial electric vehicles, and electric 2-wheelers) was identified as a target  beachhead market.  In FY23, the Advanced Batteries business expanded its cathode production  portfolio to include additional battery chemistries. Early lab-scale results show  successful production of Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) and Lithium Nickel  Manganese Oxide (LNMO) cathode materials. The production of new battery  chemistries may open opportunities in larger segments of the battery market  and demonstrate the potential of Calix’s production methods as a more  sustainable and low-cost chemistry agnostic platform technology.   FY24 priorities  1. Include Calix’s battery module in a consumer product format. 2.	Complete the FEED for a demonstration facility for cathode  production. 3.	Develop a commercial format cell with a new Calix electrode  chemistry. 10Global lithium-ion battery capacity to rise five-fold by 2030 49  ===== PAGE 50 ===== Batteries are an essential enabling technology for our  clean energy future, decarbonising transport and  stabilising renewably powered energy grids. The ongoing, rapid growth of the global battery market  makes finding more economical and sustainable  production methods increasingly important to meeting  the Sustainable Development Goals. Calix’s low-cost, simple and safe battery chemistry  shows significant promise, potentially enabling improved  efficiencies, and a reduction in cost and environmental  footprint of energy storage options. SDG Impact 50  ===== PAGE 51 ===== Biotech Business overview Calix’s Biotech business is developing high surface area magnesium oxide  materials with unique bioactive properties for three target applications: Agriculture Reducing dependence on lethal chemical pesticides is an important  challenge for the agriculture industry. Calix BOOSTER-Mag is a safe, low-cost  and environmentally sustainable alternative to conventional insecticides.  Now registered in Australia, BOOSTER-Mag provides non-lethal pest  suppression, designed to enable reduced use of conventional insecticide               without compromising yield or yield quality. Marine Marine biofouling increases hull surface roughness, fuel consumption and  greenhouse gas emissions. Conventional anti-foul paints and coatings are  toxic and have well documented negative effects on the marine environment.  To deliver more sustainable marine-fouling and corrosion control, Calix is  developing non-toxic bioactive additives that aim to enable a material reduction  in the use of toxic biocides. Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Following many years of overuse and the development of resistance, reducing reliance on conventional pesticides, biocides and antibiotics is urgently needed. The antimicrobial properties of Calix’s unique bioactive  materials, with low resistance development potential, offer a promising  sustainable alternative to conventional actives.   Market trends Agriculture: non-conventional pesticides, that is, biologicals, are predicted to  grow at 15% p.a. for the next 10 years,11 largely driven by the ongoing  prohibition of many conventional pesticides.   Marine: with increasing focus on emissions from shipping, the International  Maritime Organisation has adopted a new emissions reduction strategy12 and is strengthening biofouling measures13.  Antimicrobial Resistance: AMR is internationally recognised as a global  crisis, projected to cost the global economy US$100 trillion and cause 10 million  deaths per year by 205014.   FY23 achievements Agriculture: Calix continued to develop a non-lethal insecticide                             alternative product for potential introduction to the Australian market.                Additional field trials are underway that aim to extend the label of Calix’s                current BOOSTER-Mag registration. A second season of field trials is underway  in Europe.  Marine: Calix successfully completed phase 2 static tests with leading global  coatings firms. Following this success, ongoing dynamic tests and coatings  formulation work is underway in different marine antifouling sites across North  America, Australia / NZ and Asia.  Antimicrobial Resistance: in FY23, Calix became a Tier 1 partner in Australia’s  Cooperative Research Centre Solving Antimicrobial Resistance in Agribusiness,  Food, and Environments (CRC SAAFE). Calix’s novel materials will be used for  investigating new AMR solutions in agriculture, including health and food  applications. The first project is underway and will study the application of  Calix bioactive materials in intensive livestock.  FY24 priorities  Continue to develop and commercialise Calix’s core technology  for applications in agriculture, marine and antimicrobial  resistance. 51  ===== PAGE 52 ===== The current use of particular products in agriculture,  shipping and pharmaceutical industries damages  ecosystems on land and below water, threatening  biological diversity and risking future outbreaks of  infectious diseases. To reach the Sustainable  Development Goals, solutions that enable the  sustainable use of our land and oceans are needed. Calix’s magnesium oxide based materials are non-toxic  and exhibit unique bioactive properties. Their continued  development offers multiple potential applications that  can replace polluting or damaging products in  agriculture and marine coatings, and help address  the rise of antimicrobial resistance.

Effective management of our water and wastewater helps to protect freshwater  systems, our oceans and human health by preventing detrimental pathogens,  nutrients and other types of pollution from entering the environment. Calix’s ALKA-Mag+, AQUA-Cal+ and ACTI-Mag provide safe, effective,                economical and sustainable solutions for the treatment of water and  wastewater.  Market trends In North America, regulatory tailwinds continue to drive growth in the  magnesium hydroxide market. For wastewater, increased regulation regarding nitrogen removal is creating  demand for solutions that boost alkalinity and maintain effective  microorganism activity.  For the potable water market, strengthened regulation on residual lead and  copper requires alternative pH control solutions to minimise the corrosivity  of water within the distribution system. FY23 achievements In FY23, the development of ALKA-Mag+ has helped to secure new business  within existing hydration plant regions in the Pacific Northwest and Upper Midwest of the US.     Revenue growth of 14.2% coupled with strong margins led to a gross profit  increase of 28.6%. Revenue growth accelerated during the year, with growth in  the second half of FY23 up 28% compared with the same period in FY22.   Throughout the financial period, efforts were made to progress the building of  two new hydration plants in Ripon, Wisconsin and Lufkin, Texas. Both plants are  planning to commence operations by the end of the 2023 calendar year.  The new plants will support sales in new regions, including Wisconsin, Illinois  and Texas.   Finally, the Water business has solidified relationships with two new distributors  in the wastewater treatment market, and another in the potable water  treatment market. The three distributors share a philosophy of providing world  class products, service and technical credibility. FY24 priorities  Deliver continued growth in the US and Asia. 53  ===== PAGE 54 ===== Water sits at the heart of sustainable development.

DIRECTORS  The following persons were directors of the Company during the whole of the year ended 30 June 2023 and up to  the date of the report, unless otherwise stated:  •  Peter Turnbull, AM  •  Alison Deans (appointed 1 March 2023)  •  Helen Fisher  •  Dr Jack Hamilton (retired 8 March 2023)  •  Dr Phil Hodgson  •  Dr Mark Sceats  PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES   Calix is an environmental technology company solving global challenges in industrial decarbonisation and  sustainability, including CO2 mitigation, sustainable minerals processing, advanced batteries, biotechnology and  water treatment. Calix’s patented core platform technology delivers efficient indirect heating of raw materials to  enable electrification of industries, capture of unavoidable emissions, and green industrial processing solutions. Its  flash heating approach can also produce nano-porous materials with enhanced chemical and/or  bioactivity. Leveraging its core platform technology and a global network of research and development  collaborations, Calix is developing multiple environmental businesses that deliver positive global impact.  The core platform technology– the Calix Flash Calciner (“CFC”) – is a reinvention of the kiln process that has three  core benefits:  1.  Enabling electrification and green industrial processing  Calix’s patented core platform technology is designed to help mineral and chemical processing enter the  electric age. Its indirect heating approach is compatible with renewable sources of energy and alternative fuels.  Separating the heat source from the chemical reaction may also enable the most efficient use of green  hydrogen in place of conventional, carbon intensive reducing agents.  Additionally, Calix is developing refining solutions that enhance recovery of ore and create near zero-waste  products. Renewably powered at-mine processing has the potential to enable value creation and capture  through refined, low-carbon mineral products.  2.  Enabling efficient capture of unavoidable emissions  For industries such as cement and lime, a majority of their CO2 emissions are process emissions, produced  as a direct and unavoidable result of the decomposition of limestone to lime. With no additional chemicals or  processes, Calix’s technology is being developed to efficiently separate process CO2 for use or storage to  deliver low-cost abatement of unavoidable emissions.  3.  Production of highly active materials  Calix's flash heating approach can produce nano-porous materials with enhanced chemical and/or bioactivity.  These highly active materials can be made into safe, sustainable and effective products for water and  wastewater treatment, agriculture, marine and antimicrobial resistance, and are also being developed for  advanced lithium-ion batteries.  The Group has operations, customers and distribution partners across Australia, New Zealand, Asia, Europe and  the United States of America (“US”). Its activities in the 2023 Financial Year (“FY23”) were focused across five  business segments, being: Leilac (a CO2 mitigation business), Sustainable Processing, Advanced Batteries,  Biotech and Water. These “lines of business” are supported by Research & Development (“R&D”), engineering,  operations, marketing, and finance and administration teams.

The key current development areas are:   •  demonstration and commercialisation of the technology for the cement and lime industries;   •  application of the technology in sustainable processing, including green iron and steel, and for critical  minerals, such as lithium; and   •  application of the technology for advanced battery and bioactive materials.   These activities are supported by the Group’s R&D facilities in Australia, as well as engineering groups in Australia  and Europe.            CALIX’S CORE PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY 68  ===== PAGE 69 ===== Our business activities are underpinned by:   •  a commercial-scale operations facility at Bacchus Marsh in Victoria, with a name-plate capacity of 25,000  tonnes per year of raw (magnesium oxide) product;   •  a raw material (magnesium carbonate) mine near Leigh Creek in South Australia;   •  a pilot demonstration facility for CO2 capture from lime and cement (“Leilac-1” facility) in Lixhe, Belgium;   •  an electric calciner for sustainable processing development and the production of advanced materials,  including battery materials (“BATMn” facility) at Bacchus Marsh; and   •  four manufacturing facilities in the US to produce water treatment products to serve North American  customers, with a fifth undergoing commissioning and a sixth under construction.  OPERATING RESULTS  In FY23, total revenue and other income increased by 42% to $29.6m (FY22: $20.8m), including a sales gross  margin of 33% (FY22: 28%), with continued revenue and margin contribution in the US and Asia Pacific from the  Water line of business. A strong balance sheet and cash position of $74.5m (FY22: $25.0m) is underpinned by a  $60.0m institutional placement in October 2022 and a $21.6m Share Purchase Plan completed in November 2022.   The Company undertook investment of $31.7m (FY22: $19.7m) in capability and capacity building to commercialise  Calix’s platform technology, particularly in the CO2 Mitigation and Sustainable Processing lines of business. This  includes investment in additional research, development and engineering, which accounted for 77% of the total  increase in operational expenditure. Calix concluded FY23 with 129 full-time employees (FY22: 72 full-time  employees), which includes 37 new engineers and scientists to support R&D, as well as new employees to support  customer projects.  FINANCIAL POSITION  The Group held $74.5m in cash and cash equivalents at 30 June 2023 (30 June 2022: $25.0m) and had a surplus  of $68.2m of total current assets over total current liabilities (30 June 2022: $16.5m). Calix’s strong balance sheet,  including its cash position and minimal debt, provides the capacity to simultaneously pursue commercialisation  opportunities in large addressable markets across the Company’s multiple lines of business.    MARKET CONDITIONS  Despite a challenging global economic environment – with volatile markets continuing to deal with the persistent  effects of inflation, supply chain constraints and the war in Ukraine – Environmental, Social and Governance  (“ESG”) tailwinds continue to gather strength. Commitment to and investment in solutions that align with ESG  goals continues to grow year-on-year as governments, industries and investors look to achieve their  decarbonisation goals and meet their net-zero commitments.   In FY23, various policies to drive decarbonisation were announced around the world, including:   •  a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism and Net-Zero Industry Act in Europe;   •  the Inflation Reduction Act and Regional Direct Air Capture hubs in the USA; and   •  Safeguard Mechanism, Powering the Regions Fund, National Reconstruction Fund, and Critical  Minerals Strategy in Australia.   These policies recognise the need for urgent, affordable and scalable solutions that balance social, economic  and environmental sustainability to solve some of the greatest global challenges of our time.   REVIEW OF OPERATIONS  As planned, the Group invested in people, capital and services in FY23, helping to fuel activity in R&D and  commercialisation. The investment costs in people and technology development – specifically R&D and  engineering capability – were partly offset with $10.7m in FY23 in grants and tax rebates from governments in the  various jurisdictions in which Calix operates.       69  ===== PAGE 70 ===== Operational highlights since 1 July 2022, include:   Leilac  •  First licence agreement signed for cement: Leilac, Calix’s 93% owned subsidiary focused on the  decarbonisation of cement and lime, signed a first-of-a-kind perpetual global licence agreement with  Heidelberg Materials (FWB: HEI).   •  The Leilac-2 project progressed: the Leilac-2 project located at Heidelberg Materials’ Hanover site  commenced procurement of long-lead items and site works (demolition of old existing infrastructure) following  some permitting delays. This will likely push commissioning into 2025. Leilac-2 is targeting 100,000 tonnes  per annum of CO2 separation and aims to establish a modular, retrofittable format of the Leilac technology for  cement applications.  •  Leilac executed non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) outlining the key terms for a  global licence agreement with Heirloom for Direct Air Capture: Leilac announced a new application of its  core kiln technology for Direct Air Capture (“DAC”) of atmospheric CO2, and a non-binding MOU for a global  licence and collaboration agreement with Heirloom.  •  Leilac and CEMEX announced new projects: Three full-scale decarbonisation projects were announced by  Leilac and CEMEX S.A.B. de C.V. (NYSE: CX) in Germany, Poland and the US. Progress was also made  towards a global licence agreement with CEMEX.   •  Calix was announced as a partner in methanol project for sustainable fuels from CO2: With funding from  the German-Australian Hydrogen Innovation and Technology Incubator (“HyGATE”) initiative, the Solar  Methanol Project aims to use renewable energy, green hydrogen and CO2 captured by the Leilac technology  to produce sustainable fuels.     Sustainable Processing  •  Joint venture executed with Pilbara Minerals (ASX: PLS): Supported by a grant of $20m under the  Australian Government’s Modern Manufacturing Initiative (“MMI”), Calix’s joint venture with Pilbara Minerals  aims to develop novel mid-stream lithium processing to produce low carbon, low waste, and high value  concentrated lithium salt.   •  Sustainable lithium demonstration plant progressed towards construction: Detailed Front-End  Engineering and Design (“FEED”) of a mid-stream spodumene processing demonstration plant, developed in  a joint venture with Pilbara Minerals, progressed towards a Financial Investment Decision (“FID”).  •  Calix awarded funding for Zero Emissions Steel Technology (“ZESTY”): A $0.947m Australian  Renewable Energy Agency (“ARENA”) grant was awarded to Calix to help fund a Basis of Design (“BOD”) and  FEED study for a renewably powered 30,000 tonnes per annum (“tpa”) demonstration plant.   •  First stage ZESTY pilot-scale tests: Pilot-scale metallisation results show ZESTY can produce H-DRI  products from multiple ore samples. The results will inform and progress design of a ZESTY demonstration  plant.   Advanced Batteries  •  Commercial-prototype LMO battery cells produced: Calix produced 4Ah commercial-prototype battery  cells using Calix Lithium Manganese Oxide (“LMO”) cathode powder, in collaboration with UK production  partner, AMTE Power.  •  Expanded to new battery chemistries: Calix expanded its battery materials capability to new chemistries,  including those favoured by the electric vehicle segment of the battery market.  Biotech  •  Calix appointed as a Tier 1 partner in Australia’s Cooperative Research Centre Solving Antimicrobial  Resistance in Agribusiness, Food, and Environments (“CRC SAAFE”): As a Tier-1 partner in the CRC  SAAFE, Calix’s materials will be used to investigate antimicrobial resistance (“AMR”) solutions. A first project  focused on AMR in intensive livestock commenced.         70  ===== PAGE 71 ===== Water  •  Continued product development and revenue growth: the development of a new product, ALKA-Mag+  helped to secure new business and grow revenue within existing hydration plant regions in the Pacific  Northwest and Upper Midwest of the USA.    •  New hydration plants progressed: New hydration plants in Ripon, Wisconsin, and Lufkin, Texas, were  advanced. The Lufkin plant is undergoing commissioning, and the Ripon plant is under construction.        CO2 Mitigation   Leilac’s purpose is to accelerate the transition to net zero by providing a compelling decarbonisation solution for  global cement and lime.   Cement and lime provide the foundations of our societies and economies. They are also amongst the largest  industrial contributors to climate change, accounting for approximately 8% of global CO2 emissions. Leilac’s  technology enables the capture of unavoidable process CO2 emissions from cement and lime production, without  additional chemicals or processes. It is being designed to be scalable, retrofittable, energy agnostic and  electrification ready to provide flexible and economical pathways to carbon neutral cement and lime. Leilac’s  technology is also being developed to deliver zero emissions lime for capture of emissions from other hard-to-abate  sectors, as well as Direct Air Capture of CO2 from the atmosphere.   Government policies and industry commitments continue to drive industrial decarbonisation across the globe. In  Europe, the emissions trading scheme reached over €100 per tonne of CO2, up from less than €20 only three years  ago. A Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism was introduced, placing a carbon tariff on imported carbon-intensive  products, such as cement. As part of the Green Deal Industrial Plan, the EU also introduced the Net-Zero Industry  Act. This Act identifies carbon capture and storage as one of eight strategic net-zero technologies and includes a  target to develop 50 million tonnes of annual CO2 storage capacity in the EU by 2030. In the United States, the  Inflation Reduction Act was passed. It included an increased incentive of US$85 per tonne to capture and  permanently store industrial CO2.    Leilac signed its first global licence agreement in October 2022. In an industry first, Leilac’s royalty fee will be based  on a percentage of the value of CO2 captured by its technology. The perpetual agreement applies to any Heidelberg  Materials facility where the Leilac technology is installed. The Leilac-2 Project at Heidelberg Materials’ Hanover  site commenced procurement of long-lead items and site works (demolition of old existing infrastructure) following  some permitting delays. This will likely push commissioning into 2025. Leilac-2 is targeting 100,000 tonnes per  annum of CO2 separation and aims to establish a modular, retrofittable format of the Leilac technology for cement  applications. Leilac’s pipeline of projects continued to grow, including the announced three projects with Cemex,  and a zero-emissions lime project with Tarmac which passed the due diligence phase of the UK Government’s  Industrial Carbon Capture funding scheme. In FY23, Leilac also announced a partnership with a DAC company,  Heirloom. The partnership aims to integrate Leilac’s electric kiln technology into Heirloom’s DAC process for  removal of atmospheric CO2. A signed MoU outlines the key terms for a global licence and collaboration agreement.                     71  ===== PAGE 72 =====     Sustainable Processing  Calix’s patented core platform technology aims to help mineral and chemical processing enter the electric age. An  indirect radiative heating approach separates the heat source from the chemical reaction and removes the need  for combustion. Compatible with renewable sources of energy and grid-load balancing applications, Calix’s  technology is also being designed to enable efficient use of green hydrogen in place of conventional, carbon- intensive reductants, enhance recovery of ore, and create near zero-waste products. At-mine processing has the  potential to rationalise supply chains, reduce the total CO2 footprint of minerals, and add value to mineral exports.   Critical minerals were the source of significant geopolitical interest in FY23, as governments sought to develop  reliable supply chains for minerals of strategic importance in a decarbonising global economy. The US-Australia  Climate, Critical Minerals and Clean Energy Transformation Compact was announced. It aims to fast-track critical  mineral supply chains and provide access to US capital for Australian companies. In Europe, the Critical Raw  Materials Act also aims to diversify and enhance the resilience of EU critical raw material supply chains. In Australia,  the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund includes up to $3 billion for renewables and low emission technologies  and $1 billion for value-adding in resources. An additional $400m was announced for Critical Inputs for Clean  Energy Industries, such as steel, cement and lime, and alumina.   FY23 saw considerable focus on the development of Calix’s ZESTY. A $947,035 grant from the Australian  Government’s ARENA is supporting the design of a renewably powered direct hydrogen reduced iron (“H-DRI”)  demonstration plant. Initial pilot-scale testing showed metallisation of a range of iron ore types with ZESTY.   In November 2022, Calix executed a joint venture agreement with Pilbara Minerals to develop a novel mid-stream  lithium processing technology to produce low carbon, low waste, and high value lithium salt. In FY23, the joint  venture progressed detailed engineering and design of a demonstration plant that aims to utilise Calix’s electric  calcination technology at Pilbara Minerals’ Pilgangoora Project. The proposed demonstration plant is supported by  a $20m grant under the Australian Government’s MMI. A FID for the demonstration plant was approved by the  boards of Calix and Pilbara Minerals on 2 August 2023.   In FY23, Calix also continued to explore and develop further applications of its sustainable processing technology,  including to alumina and other critical minerals.           Advanced Batteries  Calix is developing a renewably powered, energy efficient and low-cost chemistry-agnostic platform technology  targeting production of high-performance nanostructured battery materials.   Demand for lithium-ion battery materials is growing, driven by a transition towards electric vehicles and renewably  powered energy grids supported by battery storage. By 2030, global battery capacity is expected to grow more  than five-fold to 5,500 GWh, reaching an estimated total addressable market of over US$400b.1 Government  policies, such as the US Government’s US$369b Inflation Reduction Act and the European Critical Minerals Act,  are driving efforts to build sovereign capabilities and supply chains. This has increased demand for localised, high  quality and sustainable battery material production.   In FY23, the Advanced Batteries business progressed the development of commercial-prototype battery cells, in  collaboration with UK production partner, AMTE Power, and prototype single layer pouch cells. Calix also continued  its collaboration with Deakin University and expanded its cathode production portfolio to include additional battery  chemistries. Early lab-scale results showed successful production of Lithium Iron Phosphate (“LFP”) and Lithium  Nickel Manganese Oxide (“LNMO”) cathode materials. The production of new battery chemistries aims to  demonstrate the potential of Calix’s production methods as a chemistry-agnostic platform technology.       1 Global lithium-ion battery capacity to rise five-fold by 2030  72  ===== PAGE 73 =====     Biotech  Calix’s Biotech business continued to develop magnesium oxide materials with high bioactivity for three target  applications:   Agriculture   Reducing dependence on lethal chemical pesticides is an important challenge for the agriculture industry. Calix  BOOSTER-Mag is a safe, low-cost, and environmentally sustainable alternative insecticide now registered in  Australia. BOOSTER-Mag provides non-lethal pest suppression that aims to enable reduced use of conventional  insecticide without compromising yield or yield quality. Non-conventional pesticides are predicted to grow at 15%  per annum for the next 10 years2, driven in part by the prohibition of many conventional pesticides. In FY23, in  collaboration with an EU agricultural cooperative, a second season of extended field trials commenced in the  Netherlands, following the banning of the fungicide Mancozeb in the EU. Additional field trials also commenced to  extend the label of Calix’s current BOOSTER-Mag registration.   Marine   Marine biofouling increases hull surface roughness, fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.  Conventional anti-foul paints and coatings are toxic and have well documented negative effects on the marine  environment. In FY23, the International Maritime Organisation adopted a new emissions reduction strategy3 and  indicated it will strengthen biofouling measures4. Calix is developing non-toxic bioactive additives that aim to deliver  more sustainable marine-fouling and corrosion control through a material reduction in the use of toxic biocides. In  FY23, Calix completed phase two static tests with leading global coatings firms. Dynamic tests and coatings  formulation work commenced in different marine antifouling sites across North America, Australia, New Zealand  and Asia.    Antimicrobial Resistance   Following many years of overuse of conventional pesticides, biocides and antibiotics, AMR is projected to cost the  global economy US$100 trillion and cause 10 million deaths per year by 2050.5 The antimicrobial properties of  Calix’s bioactive materials, with low resistance development potential, may offer a sustainable alternative to  conventional actives. In FY23, Calix became a Tier 1 partner in Australia’s CRC SAAFE. A first project with CRC  SAAFE has commenced, studying the application of Calix bioactive materials in improving health in intensive  livestock.          Water  Water and wastewater management is a challenge that can threaten vital waterways, impacting health and the  environment. Effective management of water and wastewater helps to protect freshwater systems, oceans and  human health by preventing detrimental pathogens, nutrients and other types of pollution from entering the  environment. Calix’s products aim to provide safe, effective, economical and sustainable solutions for the treatment  of water and wastewater.   In North America, regulatory tailwinds continued to drive growth in the magnesium hydroxide market. For  wastewater, increased regulation regarding nitrogen removal created demand for solutions that boost alkalinity and  maintain effective microorganism activity. For the potable water market, strengthened regulation on residual lead    2 Insightace analytic  3 2023 IMO Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships  4 Draft revised Biofouling Guidelines approved at PPR 10th session  5 United Nations Environment Programme (2022).

In FY23, Calix’s Water business identified and secured new sales within its existing hydration plant regions in the  Pacific Northwest and Upper Midwest of the United States. The US Water business recorded revenue growth for  the full year of 14.2%, while strong margins led to a gross profit increase of 28.6%. Revenue growth accelerated  during the year, with growth in the second half of FY23 up 28% compared with the same period in FY22. Throughout  the financial year, the construction of two new hydration plants in Ripon, Wisconsin, and Lufkin, Texas, progressed.  The Lufkin plant is undergoing commissioning, and the Ripon plant is under construction.    FUTURE DEVELOPMENT, PROSPECTS AND BUSINESS STRATEGIES  The Group will continue to pursue the following strategies and activities as it works towards achieving its 2024  Financial Year (“FY24”) priorities.   In FY24, Calix will continue to focus on accelerating the development and commercialisation of its technologies for  industrial decarbonisation, including electrification of industrial processing and capture of process CO2 emissions.  Priorities include the progression of projects through engineering milestones, including the commencement of civil  works for Leilac-2 and construction of the mid-stream lithium-phosphate demonstration plant at Pilbara Minerals’  Pilgangoora project. Calix will also continue to develop its core platform technology for application to alumina  refining and the production of cathode active materials for lithium-ion batteries.  In FY24, Calix plans to combine its Water and Biotech businesses into a new Magnesia line of business. This  change is designed to increase the scale and reach of Calix’s magnesium-based products. The Magnesia business  will focus on delivering revenue growth for the Group through increased sales of water treatment products in the  US and Asia. In addition, it will focus on the development and commercialisation of applications for agriculture,  marine and antimicrobial resistance, and sustainable processing of magnesium metal.     Calix continues its strategy to leverage the Group’s core platform technology for applications it believes can create  shared value and economic growth, and can support sustainable competitive advantages. Calix will pursue low  touch business models, including the conversion of existing relationships to licence agreements to assist the  Company achieve its objectives.      GOING CONCERN  The financial report has been prepared on a going concern basis.  SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE STATE OF AFFAIRS  Other than the milestones set out in the review of operations and the capital raise noted above, there were no  significant changes in the state of affairs of the Group during the year.  DIVIDENDS   No dividends were paid or were payable during the year (2023: $NIL).

P J Turnbull AM   Chair  Calix Limited  Sydney, Australia    24 August 2023  79  ===== PAGE 80 ===== Remuneration report (Audited)   Introduction    This remuneration report sets out the remuneration information for directors of Calix Limited and its controlled  entities (“the Group” or “Calix”) consisting of Calix Limited (“the Company”) and entities under its control, and other  Key Management Personnel (“KMP”). For the purposes of this report, KMP of the Group is defined as those persons  having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling major activities of the Company and the  Group, directly or indirectly, including any director of the Company.    The key objectives of the Group’s remuneration policies are to align Calix’s directors, KMP and employees,  including KMP, with shareholders’ interests, while ensuring remuneration structures are fair and competitive. The  policies, including an Employee Incentive Scheme (“EIS”), seek to balance incentives to achieve annual short-term  goals with incentives to create and execute opportunities that build long-term shareholder value. The employee  incentive scheme, in particular, is designed to balance these goals by providing employees with ‘at risk’ rewards  for their performance. Subject to performance requirements being met, employees receive awards that vest over  a period of six years. Since the inception of the employee incentive scheme in 2018 when the Company was listed  on the Australian Securities Exchange (“ASX”), the Company’s value has grown significantly.     The directors believe the current remuneration policies are appropriate and effective to attract, retain and motivate  the KMP needed to run and manage the Group. The directors’ policies for determining the nature and amount of  remuneration for directors and KMP of the Group follow:    Non-executive director remuneration  •  Non-executive directors’ remuneration is approved by the Board of Directors (“the Board”) and shareholders.  Remuneration is reviewed annually, based on market practice, duties and accountability. Independent  external advice is sought when required. The maximum aggregate of fees that can be paid to non-executive  directors is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”).  •  At the AGM of shareholders in 2022, a resolution to increase the non-executive director fee pool was carried.  The increase is helping to ensure:  o  Board composition – the Board maintains a proactive and careful process of board renewal to  ensure the size and composition of the Board is appropriate to support the continued delivery of  the Group’s growth strategies.  o  Board size – given Calix’s growth trajectory, and the breadth of commercial options and  pathways available in the future, it is anticipated that additional directors with the requisite skills  and experience to further support the Group’s growth strategies will be required.  o  Board fee competitiveness – the increase in the fee pool provides the Board with the ability to  appoint and remunerate non-executive directors at a level commensurate with current market  rates and, as necessary, enable Calix to attract and retain new directors of the highest calibre.  o  Alignment with peers – the level of non-executive directors’ remuneration is reviewed annually  to ensure alignment with the market. Benchmarking of ASX companies of a similar size,  profitability, and growth and risk profile confirmed that the increased fee pool is in line with similar  companies within Calix’s broad market sector. The previous fee pool increase was in 2011.    Non-executive directors   The following people were non-executive directors of the Group during the 2023 financial year (“FY23”) and,  unless otherwise indicated, were classified as non-executive directors for the entire year.  •  Peter Turnbull, AM, Independent Chair  •  Helen Fisher, Independent Director  •  Dr Jack Hamilton, Independent Director (retired 8 March 2023)  •  Alison Deans, Independent Director (appointed 1 March 2023)      80  ===== PAGE 81 ===== KMP salary and retirement benefits  •  All KMP, including the CEO, receive a base salary, which is based on factors such as experience, skills and  competencies. The Board reviews KMP base salary levels annually by reference to the Group’s performance,  individual performance and comparable information from industry sectors.  •  All Australian-based KMP employees also receive a superannuation guarantee contribution, which for FY23  was 10.5% (10.0% for FY22) up to the concessional contributions cap, and do not receive any other retirement  benefits.    Employee incentives  •  An EIS is applied based upon performance of both the Group and individual Key Performance Indicators  (“KPI”). The Board sets yearly KPIs for the Group to drive performance, appropriately balancing current and  future value creation, and reflecting the nature and strategy of the Group. The actual performance against  KPIs is reviewed regularly and assessed at the end of the financial year by the People and Culture Committee,  for the purpose of determining EIS outcomes.  •  The EIS is a hybrid share-based scheme that combines both short-term and long-term incentives. It is  designed to retain and motivate Calix’s employees, building alignment of employees’ interests with  shareholders’ interests to deliver shareholder value, consistent with the nature and strategy of the Group.   •  Typically, no cash-based bonuses are provided to management and staff. Cash-based bonuses are only  available if there is significant outperformance achieved in Group KPIs, as well as positive earnings before  interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”), that is, if the Group generates significant cash  earnings. The Group has not paid any such cash-bonus since its listing on the ASX in 2018.    Details of the mechanisms by which the EIS operates are further set out in the Remuneration Report below.     KMP remuneration    The following executives of the Group were classified as KMP during FY23 and, unless otherwise indicated, were  classified as KMP for the entire year.

Calix’s success into the future will be based on its ability to commercialise its intellectual  property assets and to continue to innovate and find new ways to apply its capability. To this end, team members  need to strike the right balance between achieving annual short-term goals whilst also working towards new  opportunities to build shareholder value by leveraging the Calix’s technology. Calix’s ‘at-risk’ EIS is designed to  balance these objectives, providing rewards for performance in the current year that accrue over the medium to  longer term.      Background  On 18 April 2018, at an extraordinary general meeting, the shareholders of Calix approved a new EIS to operate  once the Company was listed. The Calix Officers & Employees Incentive Scheme (“EIS”) provides for the grant of  rights and/or options to eligible officers and employees (as determined by the Board) and is intended to provide  competitive, performance-based remuneration supporting retention, incentive and reward, and alignment with  shareholders. Non-executive and independent directors are not invited to participate in the EIS.    Key terms of the EIS are published on the ASX and the scheme is summarised below:    Overview of the EIS   The EIS is a hybrid scheme that provides both short-term and long-term incentive to all employees, including KMP  – aligning employees’ remuneration and interests with shareholders’ interests. For KMP and senior executives,  each round of the scheme operates over a six-year period, with a maximum option pool approved by the Board in  year zero, the first tranche of awards vesting at the end of year one, and the final tranche of awards vesting on the  sixth anniversary of the initial option award.     The EIS for KMP and senior executives is delivered by zero priced options. Performance-vesting of the allocated  options is subject to a series of three performance gateways assessed in each year of the three-year performance  period. At the end of a three-year performance period, options which did not meet annual performance gates are  subjected to further performance testing based on criteria for superior Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”)  performance. All Performance-vested options are then subject to tenure-based vesting over a three-year period.  84  ===== PAGE 85 ===== Details and worked examples of the performance criteria and vesting schedules over the six-year period are  provided below.    The first round of the EIS was made available to all Calix employees, including KMP (and excluding non-executive  directors), at the end of 2018 with an ability to earn parcels of share-based incentives over the proceeding five- year period to 30 June 2023. The scheme was extended in 2022 with an additional round made available with the  ability to earn parcels of share-based incentives over the proceeding five-year period to 30 June 2026. Additional  rounds of the scheme will typically be made available every three years.    The Board typically limits the number of shares over which options or rights will be issued under the EIS to 2% of  the total number of shares on issue (i.e. undiluted) in any one year. Subject to any limitations that might apply  under the Corporations Act 2001 or limits under ASIC class order relief, there is no limit on the number of rights  and/or options that may be issued under the EIS. The actual percentage of rights on issue will fluctuate as a result  of changes in staffing levels.     Individual incentives and performance criteria for KMP and Senior Executives  The maximum potential award under the EIS for each executive is based on a percentage of gross salary, with the  proportion of total remuneration ‘at risk’ increasing with executive responsibility. The maximum potential award per  year for senior executives is 40% of their gross salary, 50% for the Chief Science Officer and Chief Financial  Officer, and 65% for the Chief Executive Officer.     The actual award each year is determined as a percentage of maximum potential award, based on the three  performance gateways detailed below (performance vesting). The actual award from each year then vests over the  subsequent three-year period with one third of the actual award vesting immediately and one third at the end of  each subsequent year (tenure vesting).    In an illustrative example – a senior executive is allocated a maximum possible 90,000 options under the EIS at  the start of the scheme, reflecting 120% (40% x 3) of the executive’s gross salary. Assuming a salary of $225,000  this results in an allocation of $270,000. Assuming $3 per Calix ordinary share at the commencement of the scheme  this results in an allocation of 90,000 zero priced options at the start of the scheme. At the end of each of the first  three years of the scheme, the maximum potential award is 30,000 options, with the actual award being subject to  three performance gateways (performance vesting). The actual award for each year, then vests subject to tenure,  with one third able to vest immediately, and the remaining two thirds vesting in equal tranches over the next two  years (tenure vesting).     Performance Gateways  Three Performance Gateways are used to determine performance-vesting in each year and are applied  sequentially:    Gateway 1 – SHEQ performance  Gateway 1 is achieving the Company’s Safety, Health, Environment, and Quality Action Plan KPIs as agreed with  the Board each year. If the Safety Health, Environment, and Quality Action Plan KPIs are not met, then no rights  or options can be awarded for performance that year. This Performance Gateway is designed to ensure that Safety,  Health and Environmental performance of our team members and Quality of our products and services remain  paramount at all times. The Action Plan reflects International Standard ISO45001, against which the Company is  audited annually.    Gateway 2 – Share price performance  Gateway 2 assesses absolute share price performance over the year as measured by TSR, as described below.  TSR is measured as Calix’s share price performance, being the 30-day Volume-Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”)  over the 15 days preceding, and the 15 days after, June 30 in the prior financial year (“Baseline TSR”) as compared  with the 30-day VWAP over the 15 days preceding and the 15 days after 30 June in the current financial year  (“Measured TSR”). If the Measured TSR for a particular financial year is not higher than the Baseline TSR for that  85  ===== PAGE 86 ===== period of measurement, any options or rights earned under Performance Gateway 3 (as described below) remain  unvested. However, such unvested options or rights may vest if at any time before the end of the financial year  immediately after the full vesting period, the 30-day VWAP for Calix’s shares exceeds the applicable Baseline TSR  for those unvested rights. This mechanism is designed to ensure that shorter-term goals or advances do not  dominate over more significant, longer-term value creation opportunities, so that KMP continue to balance shorter  term outcomes with a longer-term view of outcomes for a multi-year, multi-application value opportunity.    Gateway 3 – Performance against KPIs  Gateway 3 measures Company and executive performance against KPIs agreed each year with the Board. These  KPIs reflect the corporate milestone targets set for each line of business, and are communicated to the market in  the Company’s Remuneration Report, full year and half year financial reports, in addition to the Company’s annual  report and AGM. Gateway 3 helps to drive achievement of annual performance metrics that balance both short- term and long-term shareholder value creation.      The EIS rights or zero priced options that have passed through all three gateways will be classed as “Performance- vested”. These options will then be subject to tenure-based vesting with one third vesting immediately. The other  two thirds will then vest in two equal traches at the end of each of the two full financial years following the  Performance year, provided the KMP or senior executive remains a full-time employee of the Company.     To continue the illustrative example above:  1.  In year 1, a KPI result of 7/10 was achieved, meaning 21,000 options have Performance-vested for the  senior executive above. Of these 21,000 options, one third is immediately Tenure-vested, while the  remaining 14,000 options vest in equal tranches at one year and two years after the performance year,  provided the senior executive is still with the Company.  2.  In year 2, a KPI result of 6/10 was achieved, meaning 18,000 options have Performance-vested. Of these  18,000 options, one third is immediately Tenure-vested, while the remaining 12,000 options vest in equal  tranches at one year and two years after the performance year, provided the senior executive is still with  the Company.  3.  In year 3, a KPI result of 9/10 was achieved, meaning 27,000 options have Performance-vested. Of these  27,000 options, one third is immediately Tenure-vested, while the remaining 18,000 options vest in equal  tranches at one year and two years after the performance year, provided the senior executive is still with  the Company.       The table below outlines this illustrative example:      86  ===== PAGE 87 =====   ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE: VESTING OF OPTIONS  A maximum total of 90,000 options  are allocated to a senior executive  Vesting of each tranche of options under the initial allocation of a  90,000 option pool for a senior executive    BEGINNING  YEAR 1  END OF  YEAR 1  END OF  YEAR 2  END OF  YEAR 3  END OF  YEAR 4  END OF  YEAR 5  Earned options in year  1: 7/10 KPI result    7,000  7,000  7,000      Earned options in year  2: 6/10 KPI result      6,000  6,000  6,000    Earned options in year  3: 9/10 KPI result        9,000  9,000  9,000  (Next EIS scheme  commences)              Unearned options    3,000  7,000  8,000  5,000  1,000  Total options earned  and vested    7,000  13,000  22,000  15,000  9,000    Further performance testing of unvested options at the end of the three-year performance period  For the first round of the EIS (covering FY18 to FY21), options or rights that remained unvested at the end of the  last Performance period (other than those subject only to tenure-based vesting) were subject to further performance  testing. The Board was able to award those rights or options if the team delivered a superior TSR performance  measured as follows:    •  50% of the remaining unvested rights if the Measured TSR at the end of the last Performance vesting period  exceeded the Initial Public Offering Offer Price (“Offer Price”) by 150%; and  •  The remaining 50% of the unvested rights if the Measured TSR at the end of the last Performance vesting  period exceeded the Offer Price by 250%.    As both tests were met at the conclusion of the 2021 financial year, those remaining unvested options were deemed  by the Board to be Performance-vested. These options were then subject to tenure-based vesting.    For the second round of the EIS (covering FY22 to FY24), if any options or rights remain unvested (other than due  to the timing of the grant of such rights), the Board will be able to perform a further performance review at the end  of the 2024 financial year (“FY24”). The Board will be able to award those rights or options if the team has delivered  a superior TSR performance, defined as follows:    •  50% of the remaining unvested rights if the Measured TSR at the end of the last Performance vesting period  (FY24) has exceeded the 2022 financial year (“FY22”) Baseline by 75%; and  •  The remaining 50% of the unvested rights if the Measured TSR at the end of the last Performance vesting  period (FY24) has exceeded the FY22 Baseline by 125%.    If awarded, these rights or options will then be subject to tenure based vesting over three years.    87  ===== PAGE 88 ===== These provisions are a key mechanism to ensure that innovations that create long-term value for shareholders are  rewarded, and that the Company and KMP balance their focus on long-term value creation, while also delivering  on shorter term KPIs focused on the foundations of long term value.     Following on from the illustrative example above, the table below shows how this further performance testing works:    ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE: VESTING OF OPTIONS  A maximum total of 90,000 options  are allocated to a senior executive  Vesting of each tranche of options under the initial allocation of a  90,000 option pool for a senior executive    BEGINNING  YEAR 1  END OF  YEAR 1  END OF  YEAR 2  END OF  YEAR 3  END OF  YEAR 4  END OF  YEAR 5  Earned options in year  1: 7/10 KPI result    7,000  7,000  7,000      Earned options in year  2: 6/10 KPI result      6,000  6,000   6,000    Earned options in year  3: 9/10 KPI result        9,000  9,000  9,000  (Next EIS scheme  commences)              Unearned options  (24,000)    3,000  7,000  8,000  5,000  1,000  Total options earned  and vested    7,000  13,000  22,000  15,000  9,000  Further TSR Test        Test Point      If share price 75%  above FY22 Baseline          50% of  24,000 / 3=  4,000    4,000    4,000    If share price 125%  above FY22 Baseline          100% of  24,000 / 3  = 8,000    8,000    8,000          The following chart illustrates how this part of the EIS operated to benefit shareholders with a strong performing  share price in the five years following the Company’s listing on the ASX.       88  ===== PAGE 89 =====     The outcome illustrated in the chart reinforces the EIS objective to align management and staff with the longer- term to deliver shareholder returns, and reinforces that at-risk remuneration is earned if shareholders benefit from  an appreciation in the value of the Company.    Claw back provision  In the event of fraud, dishonesty, or other material breaches of Company policy, the Board reserves the right to  reassess and reduce or immediately lapse all unexercised rights and/or options, whether vested or not.     The EIS and a successful takeover offer for Calix   In the event of a successful takeover offer for Calix:  •  All rights or options that are both Performance-vested and Tenure-vested (that is, they have been earned, but  not yet exercised) will be converted into shares and included in the equity transaction as part of the takeover;  and  •  If the Board so determines, all rights or options that are Performance-vested but not Tenure-vested are able to  be converted into shares and can be included in the equity transaction as part of the takeover; and  •  If the Board so determines, all rights or options not already either Performance or Tenure-vested can vest and  convert into shares and be included in the equity transaction as part of the takeover.       Vesting of options or rights for performance to 30 June 2023    When applying the performance criteria for the period to 30 June 2023, the Board assessed the actual performance  against the performance vesting criteria as follows:    •  Gateway 1: performance against the Company’s annual safety and quality action plan was met and  achieved in full.  •  Gateway 2: the Board has confirmed that the TSR performance was not met and therefore KMP were  ineligible to receive any performance rights for FY23.  •  Gateway 3: the Group KPI’s were assessed for the business as 6.55 out of 10 (see the KPI Dashboard  for FY23 below for details).    As a result of Gateway 2 not being met, the options for FY23 have not Performance-vested at this point in time.  However, as outlined above, the Board will perform a further performance review in the following manner:   -  1.00  2.00  3.00  4.00  5.00  6.00  7.00  8.00  9.00  10.00 Close Price ($) CXL share price vs IPO offer price  Close  IPO Offer price Threshold 150% Threshold 250% 89  ===== PAGE 90 =====   1.  At the end of FY24, if the absolute TSR is above baseline during the year, Gateway 2 will be met and the  FY23 options will Performance-vest. They will then be subject to tenure-based vesting; or   2.  At the end of FY24, if the team has delivered a superior TSR performance as defined in the further testing  criteria, either 50% or 100% of unearned options from FY21 to FY23, under the second round of the EIS,  will performance vest. They will then be subject to tenure-based vesting.     Gateway 3 measures performance based upon KPIs agreed each year with the Board. The KPIs for FY23 and the  Company’s performance against each follows:        The Water business was judged to have performed well, with the achievement of increased revenue and gross  margin, albeit there were some delays to completing the two new plants. The decision to focus on the US instead  of trying to establish a new presence in the EU, at this time, contributed to a better outcome for the business.     In Biotech, new applications in health were delayed as the Solving Antimicrobial Resistance in Agribusiness, Food,  and Environments Cooperative Research Centre (“SAAFE CRC”) initiative took longer to establish than planned,  although the new livestock project under the SAAFE CRC has potential.     In Advanced Batteries, significant progress was made in production of lithium manganese oxide materials as well  as new chemistries (including lithium iron phosphate), although the commercial format packs were not delivered  by the end of FY23.     In Sustainable Processing, a decision was taken to withdraw focus on refractories, given the relatively slow pace  and size of the market, in favour of larger and faster-moving opportunities in lithium and iron and steel.  Further  expansion of the iron ore program meant the KPI to complete the ore program could not be achieved by 30 June  2023. The Financial Investment Decision for the lithium project with Pilbara Minerals (ASX:PLS) was also delayed  slightly, and achieved in August 2023.     Leilac made considerable progress, albeit completing one, instead of two new licence agreements, and permitting  delays leading to delays in the commencement of site works (demolition) for the Leilac-2 project.     After weighing up the KPI contributions from each line of business, the Board determined a weighted average KPI  score for the Group for FY23 of 6.55 out of 10.

As at the date of this report, 5,778,486  options remain on issue with certain options having lapsed as a result of staffing changes, 4,600,983 being earned,  vested and currently unexercised into Ordinary Shares, a further 1,177,503 remain unearned and unvested.    FY24 priorities     Gateway 3 measures performance based upon KPIs agreed each year with the Board. This helps to drive  achievement of annual performance metrics, balancing both short-term and long-term shareholder value creation.  The KPIs agreed by the Board for FY24 follow:        *Magnesia includes the lines of business previously referred to as Water and Biotech. The Magnesia business is focused on  developing and applying Calix’s magnesium-based materials to solve environmental challenges, including its highly active  magnesium oxide materials for water treatment, agriculture, marine and antimicrobial resistance applications.       Additional cash bonus opportunity  If all Company KPIs are achieved in full, and provided the Company also achieves a positive EBITDA, KMP can  also qualify for a cash bonus, payable immediately, that will be shared amongst the total payroll of the Company  based upon base pay, and not exceeding 10% of EBITDA in total. No cash bonuses have been paid to KMP  pursuant to this incentive.    Leilac 91  ===== PAGE 92 ===== This report is signed in accordance with a resolution of the Board of directors.

SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial report are set out below. The financial  report covers the consolidated group of Calix Limited (“the Company”) and its controlled entities (“the Group”).    The following is a summary of the material accounting policies adopted by the Group in the preparation of the  financial report. The accounting policies have been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise  stated.    a)  Basis of preparation  The financial report is a general purpose financial report that has been prepared in accordance and compliance  with Australian Accounting Standards (including Australian Accounting Interpretations) of the Australian Accounting  Standards Board (AASB) and Corporations Act 2001 as appropriate for profit oriented entities; and therefore this  financial report also complies with the International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International  Accounting Standards Board.     (i)  Historical cost convention  The financial report has been prepared on an accrual basis and is based on historical costs, modified, where  applicable by the measurement at fair value of selected non-current assets, financial assets and financial liabilities.    (ii) Critical accounting estimates  The preparation of financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires  management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas  involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant  to the financial statements are disclosed in Note 1(i).    b)  Going concern  The financial report has been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the continuity of normal  business activities and the realisation of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. During  the year ended 30 June 2023, the Group incurred a net loss after tax of $23,415,054 (June 2022: $16,507,819),  and cash flow out from operating activities of $17,254,052 (June 2022: cash flow out: $3,740,512). As at 30 June  2023, the Group had cash reserves of $74,466,477 (June 2022: $24,982,760), net current assets of $68,181,351  (June 2022: $16,484,153).  The Group has prepared a detailed cash flow forecast which anticipates a positive cash position over the 12-month  period from the date of authorisation of this report.     c)  Material Accounting Policies  Accounting policies are selected and applied in a manner that ensures that the resulting financial information  satisfies the concepts of relevance and reliability, thereby ensuring that the substance of the underlying  transactions or other events is reported. Other material accounting policies are contained in the notes to the  consolidated financial statements to which they relate.                             d)  Rounding of amounts  The Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Legislative Instrument 2016/191, relating to the ‘rounding off’ of  amounts in the directors’ report. Amounts in the directors’ report have been rounded off in accordance with the  instrument       99  ===== PAGE 100 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    1. SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  e)  Goods and services tax  Revenues, expenses, and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST, except where the amount of GST  incurred is not recoverable from the Australian Tax Office. In these circumstances the GST is recognised as part  of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of an item of the expense. Receivables and payables in the  statement of financial position are shown inclusive of GST.  f)  New or amended accounting standards and interpretations  The group has adopted all of the new or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the  Australian Accounting Standards Board (“AASB”) that are mandatory for the current reporting period. Any new or  amended Accounting Standards or Interpretations that are not yet mandatory have not been early adopted.  g)  New accounting standards and interpretations not yet mandatory or early adopted  Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have recently been issued or amended but are not yet  mandatory, have not been early adopted by the consolidated entity for the annual reporting period ended 30 June  2023. The Group has not yet assessed the impact of these new or amended Accounting Standards and  Interpretations.    h)  Foreign currency transactions and balances  Functional and presentation currency  The functional currency of each of the Group's entities is measured using the currency of the primary economic  environment in which that entity operates. The consolidated financial statements are presented in Australian Dollars  which is the Group's functional and presentation currency.    Transactions and balances  Foreign currency transactions are translated into functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the  date of transaction. Foreign currency monetary items are translated at the year-end exchange rate. Non-monetary  items measured at historical cost continue to be carried at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non- monetary items measured at fair value are reported at the exchange rate at the date when fair values were  determined.    Exchange differences arising on the translation of monetary items are recognised in the profit or loss, except where  deferred in equity as a qualifying cash flow or net investment hedge.    Exchange difference arising on translation of non-monetary items are recognised directly in equity to the extent  that the gain or loss is directly recognised in equity, otherwise the exchange difference is recognised in the profit  or loss.        100  ===== PAGE 101 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    1. SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  Group companies  The financial results and position of foreign operations whose functional currency is different from the Group's  presentation currency are translated as follows:    •  assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates prevailing at that reporting date  •  income and expense are translated at average exchange rates for the year; and  •  retained earnings are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction.    Exchange differences arising on translation of foreign operations are transferred directly to the Group's foreign  currency translation reserve in the statement of financial position. These differences are also recognised in the  statement of comprehensive income as other comprehensive income. The foreign currency reserve is recognised  in profit or loss when the foreign operation is disposed of.    i)  Critical accounting estimates and judgments  The directors evaluate estimates and judgements incorporated into the financial report based on historical  knowledge and best available current information. Estimates assume a reasonable expectation of future events  and are based on current trends and economic data, obtained both externally and within the Group. Information on  material estimates and judgements used in applying the accounting policies can be found in the following notes:      Judgement Area    Note  Revenue and other income   3  Income tax   5  Recovery of trade and other receivables  7  Inventory  8  Intangibles  9  Goodwill impairment test  10  Property, plant and equipment  11  Right of use assets and lease liabilities  14  Provisions  15  Share-based payment transactions  19        101  ===== PAGE 102 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    2. SEGMENT INFORMATION  The Group identifies its operating segments based on the internal reports that are reviewed and used by the Group’s  chief operating decision makers (“CODM”).

The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be  reliably measured, it is probable that the future economic benefits will flow to the entity and specific criteria have  been met for each of the Group’s activities as described below.     Sales of goods   Revenue for these activities are recognised when the customers obtain control of these assets at the point in time  when the customer has obtained control of the goods which is considered to be fulfilment of the performance  obligation. Payment terms are usually 30 days after receipt of the goods. For sales of dosing units, warranties are  negotiated in each contract of sale.    Services transferred over time   Revenue for these activities are recognised as the customers obtains the benefit of the service over time; rental  income is recognised in the corresponding rental period that a service is provided on a straight line basis. If  payments are received in advance that income is deferred into the period that the service is delivered.    Grant income   Grant income is recognised when it is received or when the right to receive payment is established. Government  grants relating to costs are deferred and recognised in the profit or loss over the period necessary to match them  with the costs that they are intended to compensate.    R&D incentive income  The R&D incentive income recognised as other income is in relation to eligible research expenditure incurred for  the current projects. The claimed amounts have been reviewed externally to ensure they are in accordance with  the requirements of the Australian Taxation Office and AusIndustry.    Interest income  Interest income is recognised using the effective interest rate method, which for floating rate financial assets is the  rate inherent in the instrument.       104  ===== PAGE 105 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    3.

There were no  income tax effects from overseas subsidiaries.  **The Group accounts for R&D tax incentives as a government grant under AASB 120, resulting in the incentive  being recognised in the profit or loss; however the R&D expenditure is treated as non-deductible for tax purposes.    Recognition and Measurement     Current tax  The income tax benefit for the year comprises current income tax benefit, research and development claim and  deferred tax benefit. Current income tax expense charged to the profit or loss is the tax payable on taxable income  calculated using applicable income tax rates enacted, or substantially enacted, as at the end of the reporting period  together with the research and development claim submitted for the reporting period. Current tax liabilities/assets  are therefore measured at the amounts expected to be paid to/recovered from the relevant taxation authority.      107  ===== PAGE 108 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    5. INCOME TAX (CONTINUED)  Deferred tax  Deferred income tax expense reflects movements in deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability balances during  the year as well as unused tax losses. Current and deferred income tax expense/(benefit) is charged or credited  directly to equity instead of the profit or loss when the tax relates to items that are credited or charged directly to  equity.    Deferred tax assets and liabilities are ascertained based on temporary differences arising between the tax bases  of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets also result where  amounts have been fully expensed but future tax deductions are available. No deferred income tax will be  recognised from the initial recognition of an asset or liability, excluding a business combination, where there is no  effect on accounting or taxable profit or loss.    Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the  asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the  reporting period. Their measurement also reflects the manner in which management expects to recover or settle  the carrying amount of the related asset or liability. Deferred tax assets relating to temporary differences and  unused tax losses are recognised only to the extent that is it probable that future taxable profit will be available  against which the benefits of the deferred tax asset can be utilised.     Where the temporary difference exists in relation to investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and joint  ventures, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised where the timing of the reversal of the temporary  difference can be controlled and it is not probable that the reversal will occur in the foreseeable future.    Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right of set-off exists and it is intended that  net settlement or simultaneous realisation and settlement of the respective asset and liability will occur. Deferred  tax assets and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right of set-off exists, the deferred tax assets and  liabilities related to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different  taxable entities where it is intended that the net settlement or simultaneous realisation and settlement of the  respective asset and liability will occur in future periods in which significant  amounts of deferred assets or liabilities  are expected to be recovered or settled.      6.

They are presented as current assets unless collection  is not expected for more than 12 months after the reporting date. Trade receivables are generally due for settlement  within 30 days.    Recoverability of trade receivables    Credit risk management processes  Credit risk is managed through the maintenance of procedures ensuring to the extent possible, that customers and  counterparties to transactions are of sound credit worthiness. Such monitoring is used in assessing receivables for  impairments. Where the Group is unable to ascertain a satisfactory credit risk profile in relation to a customer or  counterparty, the risk may be further managed through obtaining security by way of personal or commercial  guarantees over assets of sufficient value which can be claimed against in the event of any default. Where a  creditor is more than 60 days overdue, and there is no agreed payment plan in place, the debt shall be considered  impaired and a bad debt provision shall be raised in accordance with the Group’s policy on recoverability of trade  receivables, see Note 21. Where a debtor is more than 90 days overdue, and there is no agreed payment plan in  place, the debt shall be defined to be in default on the basis that there is a low expectation of recoverability of the  amount.    Recognition and measurement of expected credit losses  The Group applies the AASB 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime  expected loss allowance for all trade receivables and contract assets. Trade receivables and contract assets have  shared credit risk characteristics and, as such, the expected loss rates for trade receivables are a reasonable  approximation of loss rates for contract assets. Losses incurred in the last 3 years represent less than 1% of  receivables and are immaterial. Therefore, no provision for expected credit losses has been recorded.    Other receivables are recognised at amortised cost, less any provision for expected credit losses.    Due to the short-term nature of the receivables, their carrying amount is assumed to approximate fair value. The  maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporting period is the carrying amount of each class of  receivables mentioned above. Refer to Note 21 for more information on the risk management policy of the Group  and credit quality of the receivables.     109  ===== PAGE 110 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    7. TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES (CONTINUED)  R&D incentive receivable   The Company is eligible, in the current year, for an R&D grant which is receivable after the Australia Tax Office  processes the Company’s tax return. The amount of R&D grant receivable is accrued based on eligible expenses  incurred during the financial year.   The company exceeded the $20m group turnover threshold to be eligible for the R&D incentive rebate in the prior  year and therefore was not eligible for the cash rebate from the ATO.   Deposit paid  The balance of deposits paid comprise prepayment associated with supply of utilities for Bacchus Marsh; a  guarantee on the office sites at Pymble; deposits for an overseas employment agency; and a bond paid to the  Department of Energy & Mining in South Australia for future mine rehabilitation work.  Director advances  See directors’ report on loans made to directors in the prior year. The fair value of the advances were considered  to be at face value as they were repayable before the end of the calendar year.    8.

The costs were recognised on the basis that they were incurred  in the development phase, in accordance with AASB 138, through the demonstration of technical feasibility of  completion, the intention to complete and use or sell the assets, as well as the clear path to economic benefits, the  availability of technical and financial resources, and reliable measurement of expenditure. The capitalised  development costs are not amortised until the associated product and service are demonstrated to be available for  commercial use and an appropriate amortisation period set.    Patent and trademarks  Patents and trademarks are recognised at cost of acquisition. Patents and trademarks have a finite life and are  carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses. Amortisation is systematically  allocated over the useful life of each patent and trademark. In calculating amortisation costs, patents are taken to  have a useful life of 20 years, trademarks are taken to have a useful life of 10 years.    10. GOODWILL    June 2023  $  June 2022  $  Goodwill  3,638,392  3,638,392  Total goodwill  3,638,392  3,638,392    Accounting for goodwill  Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business where the fair value of the consideration exceeds the fair value of  the net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortised, instead it is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired and is carried as cost less accumulated  impairment losses.   Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount to the carrying value of the asset. For the  current period, the recoverable amount was determined based on value-in-use calculations which required the use  of assumptions. In order to calculate the value-in-use, cash flows associated with the US operations, which is the  cash generating unit to which the goodwill was assigned, was forecasted for the next 5 years. Historical averages  were the primary sources of assumed values. Where possible, these were cross referenced with external sources.  The growth rate used in the cash flow forecast from the second year was 2.6%, being the prior year’s US inflation  rate, rather than the higher internally budgeted growth rate. The discount rate used in the cash flow forecast was  10%, being an externally sourced rate based on an analysis of the Group. These growth and discount rates were  also used to determine the terminal value.      112  ===== PAGE 113 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    10. NON-CURRENT ASSETS – GOODWILL (CONTINUED)    A sensitivity analysis was performed on the key assumptions of the cash flow forecast to determine how much  each of the assumptions would have to move in order for the recoverable amount to drop below the carrying amount  for the goodwill. In the case of the growth factor, this would need to drop to below 0.8% before an impairment would  need to be recognised. In the case of the discount factor, this would need to rise above 13.5% before an impairment  would need to be recognised. Impairment losses on goodwill are taken to the profit or loss and not subsequently  reversed.    11.

NON-CURRENT ASSETS – PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (CONTINUED)    Recognition and Measurement      Each class of plant and equipment is carried at cost or fair value as indicated less, where applicable, any  accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Plant and equipment are measured on the cost basis less  depreciation and impairment losses. The cost of plant and equipment constructed includes the cost of materials,  direct labour, borrowing costs and an appropriate proportion of fixed and variable overheads. Subsequent costs  are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is  probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can  be measure reliably. All other repairs and maintenance expenses are charged to the income statements during the  financial period in which they are incurred.    Property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land, is depreciated or amortised on a straight-line basis over  the expected useful life for the asset. Estimated useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed at the end of  the reporting period. The depreciation rates used for each class for depreciable assets are shown in the list below.  Land is not subject to depreciation.    •  Office, furniture, fittings and equipment- 10%-25%  •  Baccus Marsh calciner and R&D facilities – 5%-25%  •  Slurry manufacturing and application assets – 2%-50%  •  LEILAC plants – 20-33%  •  Mining tenements – extraction rate of ore  •  UJV Midstream Project – work in progress – not depreciating yet    The assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date. An  asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is  greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing  proceeds with the carrying amount. These gains or losses are included in the statement of comprehensive income.  When re-valued assets are sold, amounts included in the revaluation reserve relating to that asset are transferred  to retained earnings.    Mining tenements and associated mineral resources    The costs of acquiring mining tenements and associated mineral resources are capitalised as part of property plant  and equipment and amortised over the estimated productive life of each applicable resource. Amortisation  commences when extraction of the mineral resource commences. The tenement is expected to be retired in 2044.    Impairment     In the year ended 30 June 2023, no assets were found to require impairment under the Group’s accounting policy  (2022: $32,394).           115  ===== PAGE 116 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    12.

The balance is recognised as a  current liability with the amount being normally paid within 30 days of recognition of the liability.  The carrying amounts of the Group’s trade and other payables are denominated in Australian dollars. Due to the  short-term nature of the payables, their carrying amount is assumed to approximate fair value. For an analysis of  the financial risks associated with trade and other payables refer to Note 21.    13.

Borrowings are subsequently  measured at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds and the redemption amount is recognised as  profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.   Where there is an unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting  date, the loans or borrowings are classified as non-current.    Loan facility  Inland Environmental Resources, Inc. (IER) has a working capital facility for up to USD 500,000 with Umpqua Bank  to assist with funding capital expenditures at an interest rate of 9.25% p.a.  Other borrowings  The other borrowings balances comprise of asset financing facilities totalling $15,262 (2022: $48,455) with an  interest rate ranging from 5.78% p.a., and insurance premium funding facilities totalling $NIL (2022: $114,662).      116  ===== PAGE 117 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    13.

The right-of-use asset is measured at  cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for, as applicable, any lease payments made  at or before the commencement date net of any lease incentives received, any initial direct costs incurred, and an  estimate of costs expected to be incurred for dismantling and removing the underlying asset, and restoring the site  or asset. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the unexpired period of the lease or the  estimated useful life of the asset, whichever is the shorter. Where the Group expects to obtain ownership of the  leased asset at the end of the lease term, the depreciation is over its estimated useful life. Right-of use assets are  subject to impairment or adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.       117  ===== PAGE 118 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    14.   RIGHT OF USE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES (CONTINUED)  The Group has elected not to recognise a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability for short-term leases  with terms of 12 months or less and leases of assets whose fair value is less than $10,000. Lease payments on  these assets are expensed to profit or loss as incurred.  Lease liabilities  A lease liability is recognised at the commencement date of a lease. The lease liability is initially recognised at the  present value of the lease payments to be made over the term of the lease, discounted using the interest rate  implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Lease  payments comprise of fixed payments less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend  on an index or a rate, amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase  option when the exercise of the option is reasonably certain to occur, and any anticipated termination penalties.   The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are expensed in the period in which they  are incurred. Lease liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The carrying  amounts are remeasured if there is a change in the following: future lease payments arising from a change in an  index, or a rate used; residual guarantee; lease term; certainty of a purchase option and termination penalties.  When a lease liability is remeasured, an adjustment is made to the corresponding right-of use asset, or to profit or  loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is fully written down.    15.

PROVISIONS (CONTINUED)  Recognition and Measurement  Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past  event, and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the  obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.    Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle  the present obligation at the reporting date. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are  determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments  of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision  resulting from the passage of time is recognised in finance costs.    Employee benefits    Provision is made for the Group's liability for employee benefits arising from services rendered by employees to  balance date. Employee benefits that are expected to be settled within one year have been measured at the  amounts expected to be paid when the liability is settled, plus related on-costs.     Employee benefits payable later than one year have been measured at the present value of the estimated future  cash outflows to be made for those benefits. In determining the liability, consideration is given to employee wage  increases and the probability that the employee may satisfy vesting requirements. Those cash flows are discounted  using market yields on national government bonds with terms to maturity that match the expected timing of cash  flows.    Short-term employee benefits  Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits, annual leave and long service leave expected  to be settled wholly within 12 months of the reporting date are recognised in current liabilities in respect of  employees' services up to the reporting date and are measured at nominal amounts.    Other long-term employee benefits  The liability for annual leave and long service leave not expected to be wholly settled within 12 months of the  reporting date are recognised in non-current liabilities, provided there is an unconditional right to defer settlement  of the liability. The liability is measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of  services provided by employees up to the reporting date using the projected unit credit method. Consideration is  given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service.  Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the reporting date on national government bonds  with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.    Rehabilitation provision    The Group recognises a mine rehabilitation provision on the basis that it has an obligation to restore the site of the  mine in Myrtle Springs to its original condition and the cost to do so is uncertain. The measurement of the provision  is the present value of the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation as at the end of the  reporting period. It should also be noted that a bond of $274,000 was lodged on 9 October 2014 with the South  Australia Department of State Development to be applied to rehabilitation of the area at cessation of mining activity,  on the basis of a Program for Environmental Protection and Rehabilitation (PEPR) which was approved by the  South Australia Department of State Development. This bond appears in Note 7 under deposits paid.        119  ===== PAGE 120 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    16.

Ordinary shares have no par value and the Company does not have a limited amount of authorised  capital.    Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Any transaction costs arising on the issue of ordinary shares are  recognised directly in equity as a reduction of the share proceeds received.              122  ===== PAGE 123 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    17.

In this way, the share-based payment reserve is reversed for the amount of the shares and  the shares are transferred to the recipient. During the year ended 30 June 2023, $nil in shares were issued from  the ESS trust (2022: $nil).

The cumulative amount is  reclassified to profit or loss when the net investment is disposed of.    Share-based payment reserve  The share-based payment reserve is used to recognise shares and rights earned by employees and officers as  part of the ESS plan and the EIS. Shares issued through the ESS are valued at the grant date fair value of shares  issued and vested to employees and directors. These reserves are reversed against share capital held by ESS  plan when the shares vest. The rights which are as part of the EIS are valued using options valuation models which  take into account vesting criteria, market price and the exercise windows. See Note 19 for more information on  share-based payments.              124  ===== PAGE 125 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    18. RESERVES (CONTINUTED)    Warrant reserve  On 20 July 2018, the Company issued 2,359,155 warrants, which expired on 30 June 2022 at a strike price of  $0.66 per share to financial advisers and joint lead managers as part of the non-cash costs for the IPO. These  warrants were valued at $488,393 using a Black-Scholes pricing model (share price of $0.66 per share, an  expected volatility of 100% of the underlying share, and an average risk-free rate of 2.74% for the term of the  warrants).  The warrants were accounted for as equity (warrant reserve) in accordance with AASB 2 on the basis that the  warrant strike price was not subject to any adjustments and conversion of shares is fixed. The warrants in the  reserve were non-distributable and were to be transferred to share premium account upon the exercise of the  warrants. Any balance of warrants reserve in relation to the unexercised warrants at expiry of the warrants period  were transferred to accumulated profits.     19. SHARE BASED PAYMENTS  Calix Officers & Employees Incentive Scheme  EIS 1  On 18 April 2018 at an extraordinary general meeting, the shareholders approved a new EIS to operate once the  Company is listed. The EIS (EIS 1) provides for the grant of rights and/or options to eligible officers and employees  (as determined by the Board) and is intended to provide competitive, performance-based remuneration supporting  the retention, incentive and reward functions of that remuneration and drive alignment with shareholders.     During the years ended 30 June 2020 to 30 June 2023, the Group recognised a share based payment expense  related to the number of rights vesting and to be vested in connection with the fulfilment of the vesting conditions  related to these financial periods as well as the forecasted value of those rights at their expected exercise date.    During the year, Calix granted a total of no new EIS 1 rights (2022: nil new rights) at an exercise price of $NIL. Of  the total rights granted to date, 7,936,187 were exercisable at the end of the period (2022: 4,651,254), while nil  were forfeited during the year (2022: NIL). 1,354,707 rights were exercised during the period (2022: 1,714,591)  and no rights expired during the period (2022: NIL). The balance of rights at the end of the year is 4,313,485 (2022:  7,382,781). The fair value on issue of these rights is $2,164,260. An expense of $46,072 was recognised during  the year in order to revalue the share-based payment reserve in accordance with the updated valuation model and  fair value of the EIS rights.    EIS 2  On 29 September 2021 at a directors meeting, a second EIS scheme (EIS 2) was approved for the eligible officers  and employees (as determined by the Board). During the years ended 30 June 2023, the Group recognised a share  based payment expense related to the number of rights vesting and to be vested in connection with the fulfilment  of the vesting conditions related to these financial periods as well as the forecasted value of those rights at their  expected exercise date. For non senior leadership team employees the fair value of the options was determined to  be the share price on the date the terms and conditions of the offer was given to the employees. For the senior  leadership team a binomial option pricing model was used for valuing the options, as market based conditions  attach to these option.     125  ===== PAGE 126 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    19.

Of the  total rights granted to date, 739,845 were exercisable at the end of the period (2022: NIL), while nil were forfeited  during the year (2022: NIL). 51,355 rights were exercised during the period (2022: NIL) and no rights expired during  the period (2022: NIL). The balance of rights at the end of the year is 658,020 (2022: NIL). The fair value on issue  of these rights is $2,427,090. An expense of $2,694,546 was recognised during the year in order to revalue the  share-based payment reserve in accordance with the updated valuation model and fair value of the EIS rights.  Share options, across both EIS schemes, were exercised at a weighted average share price of $5.05 during the  period.     20. LOSS PER SHARE      June 2023  $  June 2022  $  a.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT    The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk (including foreign currency risk  and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s Treasury function is responsible for managing the  liquidity requirements of the Group and mitigating these financial risks through continuous monitoring and  evaluation.    The Group adheres to a set of policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on  liquidity risk, foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and the use of derivative financial instruments, as  required, for hedging purposes. The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative  financial instruments, for speculative purposes. There have been no changes to the Group’s exposure to financial  risks or the manner in which it manages and measures these risks from the prior year.  The Group holds the following financial instruments, all of which are measured at amortised cost:    June 2023  $  June 2022  $  Financial assets       Cash and cash equivalents   74,466,477  24,982,760  Current trade and other receivables   1,838,729  2,970,148  Non-current trade and other receivables   292,735  284,419  Total financial assets  76,597,941  28,237,327        Financial liabilities       Trade and other payables   3,431,920  3,256,009  Current borrowings   318,294  863,489  Current lease liabilities  354,732  277,535  Non-current borrowings   7,372  15,261  Non-current lease liabilities  636,716  315,390  Total financial liabilities  6,584,269  4,727,684    (a) Credit risk  Exposure to credit risk relating to financial assets arises from the potential non-performance by counterparties of  contract obligations that could lead to a financial loss to the Group.    Credit risk is managed through the maintenance of procedures ensuring to the extent possible, that customers and  counterparties to transactions are of sound credit worthiness. Such monitoring is used in assessing receivables for  impairments. Risk is also minimised through investing surplus funds in financial institutions that maintain a high  credit rating, or in entities that the Audit and Risk Management Committee (“ARMC”) has otherwise cleared as  being financially sound.    Where the Group is unable to ascertain a satisfactory credit risk profile in relation to a customer or counterparty,  the risk may be further managed through obtaining security by way of personal or commercial guarantees over  assets of sufficient value which can be claimed against in the event of any default.        127  ===== PAGE 128 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    21. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)  Credit risk exposure  The maximum exposure to credit risk by class of recognised financial assets at balance date, excluding the value  of any collateral or other security held, is equivalent to the carrying value of the trade and other receivables (net of  any provisions).    There is no significant concentration of credit risk with any single counter party or group of counter parties.   Past due but not impaired  As at 30 June 2023, trade receivables of $28,958 were past due but not impaired (2022: $27,811). These relate to  a number of independent customers for whom there is not recent history of default. The aging analysis of trade  receivables is as below:    June 2023  $  June 2022  $        Current                       1,442,684                        1,327,757   Less than 30 days overdue                            54,508                             77,606   Less than 60 days overdue                            -                              21,192   More than 60 days overdue                            25,236                             27,811   Total trade receivables                       1,522,428                        1,454,366     The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets and are not past due. Based  on the credit history of these other classes, it is expected that these amounts will be received when due. The  Group does not hold any collateral in relation to theses receivables.  (b) Liquidity risk  Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that the Group might encounter difficulty in settling its debts or otherwise  meetings its obligations related to financial liabilities.    Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents and the availability of  funding through adequate amount of credit facilities to meet obligations when due.    Management monitors the Groups liquidity levels (comprising undrawn borrowing facilities (Note 13) and cash and  cash equivalents (Note 6) on the basis of expected cash flows.        128  ===== PAGE 129 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    21.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)  (c) Interest rate risk  Exposure to interest rate risk relates to cash and cash equivalents and borrowings, details of which are set out in  Notes 6 and 13.  Profit or loss is sensitive to higher/lower interest income from cash and cash equivalents and interest expenses on  borrowings as a result of changes in interest rates. The following analysis shows the impact on post tax profit as a  result of a movement in interest income and expense from variable interest rate deposit and borrowing facilities.    Impact on post tax  profit  2023  $  Impact on post tax  profit  2022  $        Increase by 100 basis points  220,998  43,801  Decrease by 100 basis points  (220,998)  (43,801)    (d) Foreign exchange risk  Exposure to foreign exchange risk may result in the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument  fluctuating due to movement in foreign exchange rates of currencies in which the Group holds financial instruments  other than the Australian Dollar (AUD) functional currency of the Group. With instruments being held by overseas  entities, fluctuations in US Dollars (USD), UK Pound Sterling (GBP) and Euro (EUR) may impact on the Group’s  financial results unless those exposures are appropriately hedged.    The following table shows the foreign currency risk on the significant financial assets and liabilities held in  denominations of currencies other than the functional currency of the Group.

(1)  Westside Environmental Resources LLC (“WER”) was established as a structured vehicle to serve a single customer of  the US business. The entity was established by the Group and structured to ensure that the Group was the sole supplier  of materials to WER under an exclusive toll processing agreement.                           Consolidation accounting policies        Business combinations occur where an acquirer obtains control over one or more businesses and results in the  consolidation of assets and liabilities. A business combination is accounted for by applying the acquisition method,  unless it is a combination involving entities or businesses under common control. The acquisition method requires  that for each business combination one of the combining entities must be identified as the acquirer (i.e. parent  entity).     The business combination will be accounted for as at the acquisition date, which is the date that control over the  acquiree is obtained by the parent entity. At this date, the parent shall recognise, in the consolidated accounts, and  subject to certain limited exceptions, the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In  addition, contingent liabilities of the acquiree will be recognised where a present obligation has been incurred and  its fair value can be reliably measured.    The acquisition may result in the recognition of goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase. The method adopted  for the measurement of goodwill will impact on the measurement of any non-controlling interest to be recognised  in the acquiree where less than 100% ownership interest is held in the acquiree.    The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred for a business combination plus the acquisition date  fair value of any previously held equity interest shall form the cost of the investment in the separate financial  statements.        132  ===== PAGE 133 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    23.  SUBSIDARIES (CONTINUED)    Consideration may comprise the sum of the assets transferred by the acquirer, liabilities incurred by the acquirer  to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interest issued by the acquirer. Included in the measurement  of consideration transferred is any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Any  obligation incurred relating to contingent consideration is classified as either a financial liability or equity instrument,  depending upon the nature of the arrangement. All transaction costs incurred in relation to the business  combination are expensed to the consolidated income statement.      24. JOINT ARRANGEMENTS    The Company holds a 45% interest in the “Midstream UJV”. The unincorporated joint venture agreement requires  a supermajority vote, being 75% of the total participating interest, for all major joint arrangement decisions. These  include setting budgets, work programs, manager or auditor appointment and other significant actions. The two  joint venturers own the assets of the partnership as tenants in common and are jointly and severally liable for the  liabilities incurred by the partnership. The entity is therefore classified as a joint operation and the consolidated  entity recognises its share of all jointly held assets and liabilities, and their associated revenues and expenses.  See notes 10 & 11 for further details.    25.

NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS    (a) Disposals to non-controlling interests    On 15 September 2021 global decarbonisation investor Carbon Direct Capital Management LLC (“Carbon Direct”)  invested €15m for a 6.98% equity stake in Calix (Europe) Limited, a subsidiary of Calix Limited. This investment  was made to aid the acceleration of the development and deployment of the Group’s LEILAC technology for the  decarbonisation of lime and cement industries. Carbon Direct will advise on areas including capital markets,  regulations, commercial and technical development and help to scale this business line.     The Group applies a policy of treating transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners  of the Group. For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the  relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is deducted from equity. For disposals  to non-controlling interests, differences between any proceeds received and the relevant share of non-controlling  interests are recorded in equity. As a result, the difference between $22,845,374 AUD received (net of $1,042,697  transaction costs) and $1,669,052 related to the share of Carbon Direct is accounted for as equity reserves,  amounting to $21,176,322 as at 30 June 2023 in the statement of changes in equity.

Carbon Direct’s share of the loss since disposal, $381,936 (2022: $182,097), is disclosed as part of  non-controlling interest in the income statements.      32. AFTER BALANCE DATE EVENTS    On 2 August, 2023, the Group announced that the joint venture project with Pilbara Minerals Limited (ASX:PLS) to  construct a ~3000 tonne per annum lithium phosphate production facility had passed its final investment decision.  The project involves the commitment by the Group of A$17.5m in capital to construct the facility at Pilbara Mineral’s  Pilgangoora mine site in Western Australia for a 45% share of the joint operation. Calix’s contribution will be capped  at $17.5m of the estimated $104.9m construction costs (except for cost overruns which will be shared by both  parties).   No other matters or circumstances have arisen since the end of the year which significantly affected, or may  significantly affect, the operations of the Group, the results of those operations, or the state of affairs of the Group  in future years.           136  ===== PAGE 137 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023      DIRECTORS’ DECLARATION    1.

We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Corporations  Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board’s  APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code)  that are relevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia.  We have also fulfilled our other  ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.  We confirm that the independence declaration required by the Corporations Act 2001, which has been  given to the directors of the Company, would be in the same terms if given to the directors as at the  time of this auditor’s report.  We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis  for our opinion.   Key audit matters  Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in  our audit of the financial report of the current period.  These matters were addressed in the context of  our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide  a separate opinion on these matters.       138  ===== PAGE 139 =====   Key audit matter   How the matter was addressed in our audit  Accounting for the unincorporated joint venture  with Pilbara Minerals  As detailed in Note 11 and Note 24 to the financial  statements, Pilbara Minerals (PLS) and Calix have  executed an unincorporated joint venture (UJV)  agreement for the development of a Demonstration  Plant at the Pilgangoora Project with the aim of  producing lithium salts via an innovative midstream  value-added refining process utilising Calix’s  patented calcination technology, as well as future  commercialisation of the process.  This unincorporated joint venture is considered a  material transaction during the period.  In our view,  the accounting for the transaction is significant to  our audit as the Group might inappropriately account  for the joint venture, and the accounting policies  and presentation of the arrangement may be  incorrect.     The procedures performed in response to this key  audit matter included, but were not limited to:  •  Obtaining and reviewing the unincorporated  joint venture agreement;  •  In consultation with BDO IFRS technical  specialists, evaluating Calix’s assessment of  the appropriate accounting treatment under  AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Statements  and AASB 11 Joint Arrangements;  •  Evaluating the Calix’s assessment of the  carrying value of the investment in the joint  venture; and  •  Performing substantive testing over the  associated transactions during the year and  ensuring the treatment is consistent with the  application of the Australian Accounting  Standards.  Research and development (R&D) tax receivable  As detailed in Note 3 and Note 7 to the financial  statements, the Group recognises a material balance  of R&D incentive income and receivable.  Eligibility of the R&D incentive and accuracy of  calculation was considered a key audit matter,  together with ensuring it was appropriately  accounted for in accordance with the requirements  of AASB 120 Accounting for Government Grants and  Disclosure of Government Assistance.  We have focused on this area as a key audit matter  due to the amounts involved being material, the  conditions and requirements for eligibility, and the  inherent subjectivity associated with the calculation  of R&D tax incentives.  The procedures performed in response to this key  audit matter included, but were not limited to:  •  In consultation with BDO’s R&D tax expert,  evaluated and assessed the reasonableness  and eligibility criteria of the R&D calculation  to consider the recoverability of the claim.  •  Obtained and reviewed the R&D tax rebate  receivable calculation and considered the  inputs and assumptions included within the  calculations; and  •  Performed analytical procedures over the key  categories of the R&D calculation, comparing  against prior years and expectations  developed from discussing with management  and supporting information.  Share based payments  As detailed in Note 19 of the financial statements,  the Group has Employee Incentive Schemes in place  which result in the recognition of share-based  payments. During the year ended 30 June 2023, the  Group issued share options under a second EIS  scheme (EIS 2).  The Group uses assumptions in relation to current  and future market and non-market conditions.  Due to the complex and judgemental estimates used  in determining the value of the share-based payment  expense for the year, we consider this to be a key  audit matter.  The procedures performed in response to this key  audit matter included, but were not limited to:  •  Reviewing relevant supporting documentation  to obtain an understanding of the contractual  nature and terms and conditions of the share- based payment arrangements;  •  Reviewing management’s determination of  the fair value of the share-based payments  granted, considering the appropriateness of  the valuation models used and assessing the  valuation inputs;       139  ===== PAGE 140 =====     •  In consultation with BDO’s valuation  specialist, assess the reasonableness of  management’s valuation of the fair value of  options with market vesting conditions;  •  Assessing management’s determination of  achieving non-market vesting conditions;  •  Assessing the appropriate allocation of the  share-based payment expense over the  relevant vesting periods; and   •  Assessing the adequacy of the related  disclosures in the financial report.  Other information   The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the  information in the Directors’ Report (excluding the audited Remuneration Report section) for the year  ended 30 June 2023, but does not include the financial report and the auditor’s report thereon, which  we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, and the Annual Report to Shareholders, which is  expected to be made available to us after that date.  Our opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and we do not express any  form of assurance conclusion thereon.   In connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information  and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial  report or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.   If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date  of this auditor’s report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information,  we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.  When we read the Annual Report to Shareholders, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement  therein, we are required to communicate the matter to the directors and will request that it is  corrected.  If it is not corrected, we will seek to have the matter appropriately brought to the  attention of users for whom our report is prepared.  Responsibilities of the directors for the Financial Report   The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a  true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001  and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the  financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to  fraud or error.  In preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the group to  continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the  going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease  operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.           140  ===== PAGE 141 =====     Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Report   Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free  from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that  includes our opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an  audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material  misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material  if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic  decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.   A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial report is located at the  Auditing and Assurance Standards Board website (http://www.auasb.gov.au/Home.aspx) at:  https://www.auasb.gov.au/admin/file/content102/c3/ar1_2020.pdf  This description forms part of our auditor’s report.    Report on the Remuneration Report  Opinion on the Remuneration Report   We have audited the Remuneration Report included in the directors’ report under the heading  ‘Remuneration Report’ for the year ended 30 June 2023.  In our opinion, the Remuneration Report of Calix Limited, for the year ended 30 June 2023, complies  with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001.   Responsibilities  The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation and presentation of the  Remuneration Report in accordance with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001.  Our responsibility  is to express an opinion on the Remuneration Report, based on our audit conducted in accordance with  Australian Auditing Standards.

The Board is of the view that the tenure profile, represented by the length of service of each of its directors on the Board, is appropriately  balanced such that board succession and renewal planning is managed over the medium to longer term.  The current directors possess an appropriate mix of skills, experience, knowledge, expertise and diversity to enable the Board to discharge its  responsibilities, including overseeing the delivery of the Company’s strategic priorities.

The  redevelopment follows a significant period of renewal of the Board  in the past 18 months, and the upcoming planned retirement of  the Chair in September 2024. A refreshed board skills matrix will  be included in the Calix Corporate Governance Statement in FY25.  Further information on board renewal follows later in this report.  Each directors’ qualifications are included in the Board tenure  and qualifications table in this report, and detailed biographies  of the directors are available in the investor centre on the  Company’s website.  Role of the Chair  The Chair is responsible for leading the Board in the performance  of its duties and is elected from the independent non-executive  directors. The Chair should not hold the role of MD or CEO.  Director independence  Calix recognises that independent directors have an important role  in assuring shareholders that the Board is able to act in the best  interests of Calix and independently of management.  An independent director is a non-executive director who is free  of any interest, position, association or relationship that might  influence, or reasonably be perceived to influence, in a material  respect, his or her capacity to bring an independent judgement to  bear on issues before the Board and to act in the best interests of  the entity and its security holders generally.  The Board will regularly review the independence of each director  in light of interests disclosed and will disclose any change to the  Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), as required by the ASX Listing  Rules. The matters to be considered include the factors set out  in the fourth edition of the ASX Corporate Governance Principles  and Recommendations (ASX Principles and Recommendations) as  well as other facts, information and circumstances that the Board  considers relevant.  The Board has determined that each director other than the MD  and Executive Director were independent throughout the reporting  period. The length of service of each director is disclosed earlier in  this report, in the table titled, Board tenure and qualifications.  The Board tested the independence of the Non-Executive Chair,  without his participation in the process, given he has served on the  Board for more than 15 years. The Board concluded unanimously  that he is an independent non-executive chair. The evidence  considered by the Board, includes interactions over time between  the MD and the Chair, including differing views on various topics, the  conduct of board meetings, and board committee work undertaken  by the Chair.  Conflicts of interest  Directors are not involved in decisions where they have, or could  be perceived to have, a conflict of interest or a material personal  interest. To help directors manage any such conflicts the Board has  developed processes with the aim of ensuring that consideration of  matters by the Board and any board committees is undertaken free  from any actual influence or appearance of influence from persons  with conflicts of interest. The processes also aim to ensure that the  disclosure of Calix’s confidential information is subject to appropriate  corporate governance controls.  Independent advice  The Board may seek independent professional advice at the expense  of Calix whenever the Board judges such advice to be necessary for  its members to discharge their responsibilities as directors. Individual  directors may also seek independent professional advice at the  expense of Calix where the Chair agrees (in advance) that separate  representation is appropriate. All professional advisors must be  suitably qualified and experienced and must be acceptable to Calix.  No individual directors exercised this right during the year.  Company Secretary  The Company Secretary is appointed and can be removed by the  Board. The role supports the effectiveness of the Board and its  committees, including in relation to governance matters, policy and  procedures, preparation and dispatch of papers, minute taking, and  induction and professional development of directors. All directors  have access to the services and advice of the Company Secretary.  The Company Secretary is accountable directly to the Board,  through the Chair, on all matters to do with the proper functioning of  the Board and board committees.  BOARD OF DIRECTORS  LETTER FROM THE CHAIR  08  ABOUT CALIX  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT 2024  BOARD OF DIRECTORS   ===== PAGE 11 ===== Board committees  The Board has established committees as part of its governance framework to assist in the execution of its duties and to ensure important  and complex issues are given the detailed consideration they require. The committees are directly relevant to Calix’s business, follow the ASX  Principles and Recommendations, and support the Board in its commitment to a high standard of corporate governance.  The committees of the Board are:  – Audit & risk management  – Technology  – Sustainability  – People, Culture & Nominations Committee  Each Board committee has an independent director as its chair and comprises members who are independent directors. Each committee has  its own charter approved by the Board, under which the Board delegates authority, and each committee is required to report the outcomes  of its deliberations to the Board, so the Board is fully informed. The Board undertakes a periodic performance evaluation of each committee,  comparing the performance of the committee with its charter, while also establishing the goals and objectives of the committee for the  upcoming year.  Committee membership and a summary of each committee’s responsibilities follows. A summary of board committee meeting attendance for  FY24 is available on page 8 of the Corporate Governance Statement. The committees’ charters are available from the investor centre on the  Calix website.

The Technology Committee  assists the Board by monitoring  and advising on: Calix’s  Technology Roadmap and/or  business plans; external technical  reviews; the technical risk in  Calix’s activities; intellectual  property management and  strategy; and publication  and disclosure of scientific or  technical information.  People, Culture & Nominations  Committee assists the Board  by monitoring and advising  on: Calix’s key people and  organisational culture strategies,  including: recruitment, retention  and termination policies, and  succession planning; board and  board committee appointments,  inductions, professional  development and succession  planning; Calix’s remuneration  policy, including as it applies  to directors; non-executive  directors, executive directors and  senior executives’ remuneration  packages and performance  reviews; and Calix’s performance  against its Diversity Policy,  including any inappropriate bias  in remuneration.  The Sustainability Committee  assists the Board in its  oversight of the development,  execution and evaluation of  Calix’s strategies, policies and  initiatives related to sustainability  and the United Nations  Sustainable Development  Goals, in conjunction with other  board committees.  RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDE  09 PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS  RISK MANAGEMENT  SHAREHOLDERS  COMPLIANCE  OTHER   ===== PAGE 12 ===== BOARD PERFORMANCE &  SUCCESSION PLANNING  Director appointment and election  Prior to appointing a director, a rigorous  process of evaluation and due diligence is  undertaken to ensure the suitability and  capacity of the candidate to discharge  their duties as a member of the Calix  Limited Board of Directors (the Board). This  evaluation includes: the individual’s skills  and experience as well as their expected  contribution to the collective skills and  experience of the Board; current and  prior directorships and/or executive roles;  independence; and any other matters  that could adversely affect their ability  to effectively discharge their duties as  a member of the Board. Additionally,  appropriate background checks are  performed in relation to the appointment  of new directors, including the person’s  criminal record, bankruptcy history,  character, experience and education. Calix  provides shareholders with all material  information in its possession relevant to a  decision on whether or not to elect or re­ elect a director.  A director appointed to the Board must  stand for election at the next Annual  General Meeting (AGM) of the Company.  Directors (excluding the Managing Director  and Executive Director) must stand for  re-election at the third AGM following their  election. There is no limit on director tenure.  A recommendation that the Board supports  an existing director standing for election or  re-election is not automatic.  Director induction and development  Following their appointment, directors  are supported through a formal induction  program to familiarise them with Calix’s  business. This typically involves a  combination of meetings with the Calix  Executive Team, other senior management,  site visits and briefings on specific issues.  This process continues throughout each  director’s tenure, and on an ongoing  basis, directors are provided with papers,  presentations and briefings on matters  that may affect the business or operations  of Calix. In the 2024 Financial Year, the  Board visited the Calix Technology Centre in  Bacchus Marsh, Victoria.  All directors are expected to maintain  the skills required to discharge their  obligation to Calix, including undertaking  continuing education and relevant training.  Directors periodically undertake personal  development to maintain the skills and  knowledge required to perform their  roles effectively.  Board performance evaluation  The Chair of the Board (the Chair)  undertakes an annual evaluation of the  performance of the Board, each board  committee and individual directors,  comparing their performance with the  requirements set out in the Board Charter,  relevant board committee charters and  the reasonable expectations of individual  directors. A non-executive director from  the Board conducts an annual evaluation  of the performance of the Chair, including  canvassing the views of the other directors.  Following the annual performance reviews,  the results and recommendations from the  evaluations of the Board and committees  are reported to the full board for further  consideration and action, where required.  Additionally, the Chair establishes the  goals and objectives of the Board for the  upcoming year and amends the Board  Charter and board committee charters if  amendments are considered necessary or  desirable. The most recent performance  reviews of the Board, including the Chair,  were conducted in June 2024.  Board renewal  The Board takes a proactive approach to  board succession and renewal to ensure the  composition of the Board is appropriate at  all times to support the delivery of Calix’s  strategic goals.  On 19 December 2023, Calix announced  the appointments of Dr Sarah Ryan  and Peter Dixon to the Calix Board as  independent non-executive directors.  Effective from 1 January 2024, the  appointments represented an important  step in Calix’s board renewal and followed  the appointment of Alison Deans on  1 March 2023. A further step is the  planned retirement of Peter Turnbull  in September 2024, with Ms Deans  to become the new chair following Mr  Turnbull’s retirement.  Calix sincerely thanks Mr Turnbull for  his many years of dedicated service as  a Director and Chair of the Board. His  commitment to the highest standards  of governance, creation of long-term and  sustainable value for shareholders, and  proactive board renewal leave the Company  well positioned to execute its growth  strategies and deliver positive global impact.  The Board renewal outlined above will result  in the Calix Board being comprised of four  highly experienced non-executives and two  executive directors, further enhancing the  governance of the Company.  The Board takes  a proactive  approach to board  succession and  renewal, ensuring  the composition  of the Board is  appropriate to  support Calix’s  strategic goals.  LETTER FROM THE CHAIR  10  ABOUT CALIX  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  BOARD OF DIRECTORS  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT 2024   ===== PAGE 13 ===== REMUNERATION AND EVALUATION OF  SENIOR EXECUTIVES  The objectives of Calix’s remuneration  policies are to align the interests of  Calix’s directors and employees with  shareholders’ interests, while ensuring  remuneration structures are fair  and competitive.  Delegated authority  Calix’s Managing Director (MD) & Chief  Executive Officer (CEO) is responsible  for the day-to-day management of Calix  under delegated authority from the Calix  Limited Board of Directors (the Board),  in addition to implementing the policies  and strategy set by the Board. The role  of management is to support the MD &  CEO, leading the Company’s operations  and financial business, in accordance with  the delegated authority of the Board. The  delegated authority includes responsibility  for developing business plans, budgets and  strategies for Calix for consideration by the  Board. To the extent these are approved by  the Board, management is then responsible  for implementing these plans and budgets.  Where proposed transactions, commitments  or arrangements exceed the parameters  set by the Board, management refers such  matters to the Board for its consideration  and approval. Through delegated authority  from the Board, management is also  responsible for identifying and managing  operational and other risks and, where  those risks could have a material impact on  Calix’s businesses, formulating strategies for  managing these risks for consideration by  the Board.  Senior executive remuneration  The objectives of Calix’s remuneration  policies are to align the interests of Calix’s  directors and employees with shareholders’  interests, while ensuring remuneration  structures are fair and competitive. The  policies, including an Employee Incentive  Scheme, seek to balance incentives  to achieve annual short-term goals  with incentives to create and execute  opportunities that build long-term  shareholder value.  The People, Culture & Nominations  Committee established by the  Board regularly reviews and makes  recommendations to the Board regarding  appropriate remuneration policies, including  retirement benefits and termination  payments (if any), for senior executives and  ensures these policies enable Calix to attract  and retain valued employees, motivates  senior executives to pursue the long term  growth and success of the Company,  demonstrates a clear relationship between  performance and remuneration, and has  regard to prevailing market conditions.  The directors’ policies for determining the  nature and amount of remuneration for key  management personnel are outlined in the  Company’s annual Remuneration Report.  The 2024 Remuneration Report is included  in the Calix Limited Annual Report 2024,  which can be accessed in the investor  centre on the Company’s website.  Senior executive  performance evaluation  Calix has written agreements setting out the  terms of the appointments for each senior  executive. The Board approves the criteria  for assessing the performance of senior  executives and monitoring and evaluating  their performance annually against  agreed performance objectives and other  relevant factors.  The People, Culture & Nominations  Committee develops and implements a plan  for identifying, assessing and enhancing  competencies of senior executives and  executive directors. The committee reviews  succession plans of senior executives on  a regular basis to maintain an appropriate  balance of skills, experience and expertise  in the management of Calix and provides  advice to the Board accordingly.  Executive Team performance evaluations  were conducted for FY24 in accordance  with this process. Details of the evaluation  process and the linkages between  the result of performance evaluations  and remuneration are disclosed in the  Remuneration Report included in the Calix  Limited Annual Report 2024, which can  be accessed in the investor centre on the  Company’s website.  11  RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS  RISK MANAGEMENT  SHAREHOLDERS  COMPLIANCE  OTHER  PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION   ===== PAGE 14 ===== Calix operates under a Code of Conduct,  which is a meaningful statement of the  Company’s values and represents our  commitment to uphold the highest  standards of lawful, ethical and  responsible business practices. The Code  of Conduct is supported by a suite of  governance policies, which together, seek  to adopt leading governance standards  and practice for the Company, its directors  and employees of Calix.  Code of Conduct  Calix is committed to maintaining ethical  standards in the conduct of its business  activities. The Code of Conduct clearly  states the standards of responsibility  and ethical conduct expected of the  Company’s directors and employees. It  applies to all directors and employees of  Calix, and where relevant and to the extent  possible, consultants, secondees and  contractors of Calix. The Code of Conduct  also outlines the procedure for reporting  any breaches of the Code of Conduct and  the potential disciplinary action Calix may  take in respect of any breaches. Material  breaches of the Code of Conduct by a  director or senior executive would be  reported to the Board, in addition to any  material breaches that would call into  question the culture of the organisation.  Familiarisation with the Company’s Code  of Conduct is incorporated into the  induction program for new directors and  employees of the Company. Calix’s  Code of Conduct is available in the  investor centre on its website.  LAWFUL, ETHICAL &  RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS  Governance policies  The Board considers the governance  policies and practices adopted by Calix  during the reporting period ended 30  June 2024 follow the recommendations  contained in the fourth edition of the  Australian Securities Exchange (ASX)  Corporate Governance Principles and  Recommendations (ASX Principles and  Recommendations).  Calix’s externally available corporate  governance policies are listed below.  The investor centre on Calix’s website  provides access to each of these  policies.

RESOLUTE  Resolute means we are a purpose-driven company and  determined to make a positive difference for the long-term.  INCLUSIVE  Fostering a diverse and inclusive culture is not just a moral  imperative; it provides the foundation for driving innovation  and business success. Diversity is a key focus for our company.  TEAMWORK  At the foundation of our spirit is teamwork. We are a down-to- earth, caring, honest, innovative and dedicated team of people  working together to solve global challenges.  Calix’s values  Calix’s values provide the foundation of the Company’s culture, guide our  thinking and behaviours, helping to propel us towards our vision to become a  leading global innovator of industrial solutions for the environment.  LETTER FROM THE CHAIR  12  ABOUT CALIX  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  BOARD OF DIRECTORS  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT 2024   ===== PAGE 15 ===== Diversity and inclusion  As one of Calix’s core values, diversity and  inclusion is foundational to our culture.  The Company believes that fostering a  diverse and inclusive culture is both a moral  imperative and the foundation for driving  innovation and business success.  The Company’s Diversity Policy supports  Calix’s commitment to its values and Code  of Conduct, as well as complying with the  ASX Principles and Recommendations.  Furthermore, the policy highlights the  Company’s commitment to providing a  safe and inclusive place of work for its  employees, promoting equal opportunity  and inclusion for all employees, regardless  of gender, identity, caring responsibilities,  marital status, religion, race, ethnicity,  language, sexual orientation, ability or age.  The policy explicitly acknowledges that  organisational strength and problem solving  is enhanced when the Company makes  decisions with reference to a broader range  of ideas, values, and experiences.  In FY21, Calix’s Sustainability Team adopted  the United Nation Global Compact’s (UNGC)  Sustainability Development Goal Ambition  Benchmark of achieving gender balance at  all levels of management by 2030. In FY23,  the Company expanded its ambition to  apply across all levels of the organisation.  The Calix Limited Sustainability Report 2024,  which is available in the investor centre on  the Company’s website, provides a progress  report against this ambition, including  current data on the gender identity of all  employees, management and the board,  in addition to highlighting key initiatives  planned for FY25 to drive progress towards  achieving our ambition.  Initiatives to build a strong pipeline of  diverse candidates, development and  retention of diverse talent, and an inclusive  culture are strategic imperatives to benefit  Calix’s business, employees and the planet.  Human rights, modern slavery and  child labour  Calix respects human rights as defined  by the United Nations Guiding Principles  on Business and Human Rights and  has implemented the Principles in our  operational policies and procedures.  Furthermore, as a participant of the UNGC  since 2020, Calix has reported our progress  against the UNGC’s Ten Principles, which  include human rights and labour, through  an annual Communication on Progress,  including in 2024.  Calix supports and respects the rights of  all humans and upholds ethical and fair  labour practices. As such, Calix supports  the elimination of all forms of forced  and compulsory labour and the effective  abolition of child labour, modern slavery, and  human trafficking. Calix proactively ensures  that our innovation and business practices  protect and respect fundamental human  and labour rights, building on policies to  help ensure that human rights are strictly  upheld throughout our supply chain  and operations.  Anti-corruption and anti-bribery  Calix is committed to conducting its  business and activities with integrity. To  assist in the achievement of this objective,  Calix will not engage in corrupt business  practices, will implement measures to  prevent bribery and corruption by any  director, employee, contractor or other party  representing Calix, and will, at a minimum,  comply with all applicable laws, regulations  and standards.  In FY24, Calix received zero reports of  bribery or corruption and made no political  donations, in accordance with our Code of  Conduct and Anti-Corruption and Anti- Bribery Policy.  Security trading  Calix’s Security Trading Policy summarises  the law relating to insider trading and  sets out Calix’s trading policy, including  restrictions on buying and selling securities  of the Company. Securities include shares,  options, rights to subscribe for shares in the  Company, and any other financial products  of Calix that can be traded on a financial  market. Under the policy, certain people are  identified as designated persons and are  required to comply with the policy, including  directors, all employees of the Company  and contractors. The Security Trading Policy  is an important tool in managing the risks  associated with dealings in securities. It can  be accessed via Calix’s investor centre on  its website.  Whistleblower protection  Calix’s Whistleblower Protection Policy  is underpinned by a strong commitment  to building a culture that reflects sound  governance and promotes ethical behaviour  in the detection and management of illegal,  fraudulent, corrupt, dishonest or improper  conduct, including but not limited to  harassment, discrimination, victimisation or  bullying. The policy provides protection to  whistleblowers by establishing a mechanism  for concerns to be raised on a confidential  basis without fear of reprisal.  The Whistleblower Protection Policy  applies to any individual who is either a  current or former officer and director,  employee, contractor, supplier, unpaid  worker, or relative, dependent or spouse  of any officer, employee, contractor and  supplier, collectively referred to in this  policy as employees and stakeholders.  Whistleblowers can raise concerns with  Calix’s Company Secretary, the Chair of  the Audit & Risk Management Committee,  or a person authorised by Calix to receive  disclosures that may qualify for protection.  Employees and other stakeholders can  also raise concerns via a dedicated email  address circulated to employees and other  stakeholders. They can choose to remain  anonymous by making an anonymous phone  call or sending an email from an anonymous  email address. Any matter reported will be  investigated and addressed promptly and  appropriately, in line with the treatment  and protections outlined in the policy. Calix  educates its directors and employees on  their rights and obligations under this policy.  The Company is committed to fostering a  culture of corporate compliance, ethical  behaviour, integrity, respect and good  corporate governance. Calix’s Whistleblower  Protection Policy is available in the investor  centre on its website.  Fostering a diverse and inclusive culture  is both a moral imperative and the  foundation for driving innovation and  business success.  13 PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  RISK MANAGEMENT  SHAREHOLDERS  COMPLIANCE  OTHER  RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS   ===== PAGE 16 ===== RISK MANAGEMENT AND  ASSURANCE  Calix Limited Risk Framework  A robust risk management framework helps to enable Calix to identify, assess, monitor and  appropriately manage risks. The approach helps Calix foster and maintain a strong risk culture that  promotes risk awareness and informed decision-making across the Company’s activities.  Risk management oversight  Calix considers ongoing risk management central to achieving  its objectives. As such, Calix is committed to ensuring that risk  management practices are embedded in all business processes and  operations to drive consistent, effective and accountable action,  decision-making and management practice.  The Company’s Board Charter clearly defines the responsibility  and authority of the Company's Board of Directors (the Board) to  oversee and manage the Company’s risk management program,  while conferring responsibility and authority on the Company's  senior management to develop and maintain the risk management  program in light of the day-to-day needs of the Company. Regular  communication and review of risk management practices provides  the Company with important checks and balances to ensure the  efficacy of its risk management program.  The Audit & Risk Management Committee (ARMC) of the Board was  established to assist the Board in fulfilling its corporate governance  and oversight responsibilities, including Calix’s risk management  systems (financial and non-financial) and internal control structure.  The ARMC reviews Calix’s risk management framework annually to  assess whether it is sound and operating in accordance with the  nature and extent of the acceptable levels of risk determined by  the Board.  It reports the results of those assessments to the Board. Additionally,  the ARMC reviews and makes recommendations to the Board  regarding the adequacy of Calix’s processes for managing risk, any  incident involving fraud or other failure of Calix’s internal controls,  and the insurable risks associated with the business.  The Company's Risk Management Policy outlines the program  implemented by the Company to ensure appropriate risk  management within its systems and culture. The Company’s risk  management program comprises a series of processes, structures  and guidelines that assist the Company to identify, assess,  monitor and manage its business risk, including any material  changes to its risk profile, consistent with the Australian and New  Zealand Standard of Risk Management, AS/NZS4360. Calix’s  Risk Management Policy is available in the investor centre on the  Company’s website.  Calix’s risk management framework is depicted in the diagram below.  It sets out a high-level description of how risk governance operates  at Calix, together with key responsibilities of the Board, Executive  Team, internal audit and the lines of business. It incorporates the  three “lines of defence” for how risk is managed. The Board reviewed  the Company’s risk management framework in FY24 and satisfied  itself that the framework continues to be sound.

This includes technological  developments and actions by competitors.  In accordance with the fourth edition of the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations,  Calix’s key strategic economic, environmental and social sustainability risks and how these risks are mitigated is set out below. These risks,  in addition to Calix’s operational, financial and strategic risks, may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s strategy and/or financial  position and/or future performance of the Company.  It is not possible to identify every risk that could affect the business and the actions taken to mitigate these risks cannot provide absolute  assurance that a risk will not materialise. The mitigation actions outlined below are not exhaustive and many company-wide controls, such  as Calix’s Code of Conduct and company policies, help to provide additional support in the management of risks. Over time, the financial and  non-financial risks associated with Calix’s activities will evolve.  Risk  Description  Mitigation  Principal economic risks  Geopolitical  Calix is a global company and therefore subject to the  risks associated with doing business internationally.  Escalating geopolitical and global trade tensions can have  potentially significant, long-term implications that could  inhibit international trade, weigh on business confidence,  and constrain global investment. This could then have  material adverse effects on Calix’s business and financial  position, in addition to adversely affecting Calix’s supply  chain leading to increased costs or a reduced choice of  supply, impacting our ability to execute our plans.  Examples of escalating geopolitical and global trade  tensions include current conflicts extending beyond their  borders, new conflicts arising or key countries becoming  more inward looking, nationalistic and isolated.  While the international politics that influence geopolitical  risk are and will remain outside Calix’s control, the  Company closely monitors political and market conditions.  Strong engagement with governments, experts and  regulators improves monitoring of the risks. The Company  is focused on maintaining strong relationships with its  customers, partners and suppliers in key markets. The  diverse applications of Calix’s core platform technology  into multiple markets provides further mitigation from  geopolitical risks.  Government  policy  Unfavourable changes or volatility in government policy  in areas such as industry, critical minerals, manufacturing  and climate, as well environmental regulations or the  ability to secure governmental approval/permitting to  construct facilities in a timely manner could have an  adverse impact on Calix, and its subsidiaries’ abilities to  achieve their plans and Calix’s financial performance.  Calix is deploying a range of integrated activities to  influence governments, industry and other stakeholders  to help create favourable market conditions, including  favourable public policy settings and demand for Calix’s  solutions to mitigate this risk. Additionally, proactive  engagement with governments and regulators ensures any  potential adverse impacts from changes to government  policy or regulations are monitored, understood and where  possible, mitigated.  Competitive  technology  Calix’s technology competes against alternative  technologies. There is no guarantee that the Calix  technology will not be superseded by superior  technologies, or will achieve the growth, margins and  competitive position that constitutes a valuable, growing  business, and there is no guarantee that Calix will attract  royalty revenues from new customers.  Calix closely monitors technological advancements –  especially those of a competing nature – and invests in  Research and Development to keep ahead of, or pace with  competing technology. Calix continues to protect its IP  by safeguarding with patents. Strategic partnerships also  provide access to, and collaboration on, the development  of cutting-edge technologies. Calix also continues to  diversify its technologies to reduce reliance on specific  technologies, market, need or challenge.  Calix invests in training and development of staff, aims  to hire leading talent, and focuses on developing a  culture that fosters agility and adaptability to support  technology development.  Market  development and  expansion  There are aspects of the Calix technology that represent  additional features or a new customer value proposition  from a novel application of its technology or materials  produced by the technology. The Calix application  may take some time for customers to understand, and  therefore there is a risk that take-up will take longer  and involve more cost and effort to bring to market  than planned.  Calix develops resources to assist with educating  customers, including developing videos and whitepapers,  conference papers and presentations, media articles and  other content that details the technology’s capabilities  and benefits. Calix also seeks to partner with industry  experts, influencers and thought leaders to help  promote awareness and understanding of its technology  and benefits.  15 PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS  SHAREHOLDERS  COMPLIANCE  OTHER  RISK MANAGEMENT   ===== PAGE 18 ===== Risk  Description  Mitigation  Development and  scale up  Whilst Calix’s calciner has been running with minimal  maintenance or operating issues for over 10 years, its  robustness as a process has not been demonstrated  over decades, which could impact more rapid acceptance  of the technology into established industries. Some  applications have not been tested beyond pilot scale and  may not work in a way that is efficient and robust enough  to be of commercial interest to the relevant industry.  Calix is developing technology roadmaps for each  of the applications of its core platform technology.  These roadmaps identify a comprehensive testing and  development program for scale up and they identify the  specific design components and actions required to  mitigate development and scale up risks.  Regulatory  Calix’s operations require adherence to multiple safety,  health, environmental, employment and privacy standards  at national, state, and county / shire / local levels, and  across multiple jurisdictions where Calix will likely operate,  or may choose to operate. There is a risk that Calix may  now, or in the future, be in breach of such standards,  warranting correction, or involving financial penalties, or  possibly other more serious business impacts.  Calix is developing a framework for compliance that  outlines the policies, procedures and responsibilities for  meeting the various regulatory requirements that we have  across the markets within which we operate. The Group  continues to build its internal capability to manage this  risk and develops a support network of external experts to  assist. Certain aspects of these regulatory requirements  are subject to annual external audit and others are  addressed by an internal audit or review process.  Additional systems and processes will be developed as the  Group continues to scale internationally.  Ability to attract  and retain key  people  Calix currently employs several key management and  scientific personnel. The success of Calix’s project’s will  be dependent upon a number of highly qualified and  experienced personnel being attracted to Calix’s projects.  Calix’s future will be dependent upon the continued  performance, efforts, abilities and expertise of its key  personnel. While there are plans to put in place long­ term or evergreen employment contracts, there can be  no assurance that Calix will be able to retain personnel  or attract suitably qualified personnel in the future, if  required. The inability to attract and retain the necessary  technical and managerial personnel could have a  material and adverse effect upon Calix's operations and  financial results.  Calix's core purpose and business focus, to solve global  challenges, serves as an attractive mission for current  employees and people that we seek to recruit. In addition  to retaining this as a core purpose for the business, the  Company seeks to provide a working environment that  supports and fosters a culture that is attractive to its  people. It seeks to offer competitive remuneration policies;  the ability for its people to build ownership stakes in the  Company and regularly conducts surveys of its teams  to measure engagement levels to capture feedback and  opportunities for improvement.  Intellectual  property  Calix relies heavily on its technologies and know-how  and there can be no assurance that competitors or other  parties will not seek to imitate or develop technology  and know-how that competes with Calix or supersedes  Calix’s technology. The unauthorised use or disclosure of  its intellectual property may have an adverse effect on  the operating, marketing and financial performance of  Calix which could erode Calix’s competitive advantage.  Calix cannot be certain that others will not independently  develop the same or similar technologies on their own or  gain access to trade secrets or disclose such technology,  or that Calix will be able to meaningfully protect its  trade secrets and unpatented know-how and keep  them secret. There is an inherent risk with any licensed  technology that the licence may be terminated in  accordance with its terms or the patent invalidated by a  third party.  Calix maintains registers of its IP assets, patents,  trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. Where  appropriate, it acquires specific legal protection for its IP  by registering patents, trademarks or copyrights in specific  jurisdictions and territories. At the time of this report, Calix  has 29 registered patent families. It also seeks to secure  and maintain confidentiality agreements for its people  and with 3rd parties that it engages with or to whom it  discloses its IP. The Company seeks to educate employees  on the importance of its IP and enforces policies on IP  usage and the maintenance of confidentiality. It further  undertakes specific technical measures to limit or control  access to digital assets.  Energy cost  Calix requires a significant amount of energy as a  direct input cost for the Calix process to be run  on a commercial scale. Energy is used for heating  the Calix plant and for additional processes for  particular applications.  To mitigate high energy costs, the Calix technology is being  developed to be energy-efficient and to be optimised as  a process to reduce or minimise energy consumption.  Customers of its electric technology can use renewable  energy sources such as solar or wind power, and can look  to contract for power purchase agreements for stable  pricing. It also has the flexibility to operate in a turned  down mode to reduce its energy requirements during  times of peak energy prices.  RISK MANAGEMENT AND ASSURANCE  LETTER FROM THE CHAIR  16  ABOUT CALIX  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  BOARD OF DIRECTORS  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT 2024   ===== PAGE 19 ===== Risk  Description  Mitigation  Force majeure  events  Events may occur that could impact upon Calix and the  value of its business. These events include but are not  limited to acts of terrorism, an outbreak of international  hostilities, fires, floods, earthquakes, labour strikes,  civil wars, natural disasters, outbreaks of disease or  other natural or man-made events or occurrences that  can have an adverse effect on the demand for Calix’s  technology and products and its ability to conduct  business. Calix only has a limited ability to insure against  some of these risks.  Within certain operations of its business, the Company has  developed continuity and disaster recovery plans. It also  maintains sufficient quantities of stock on hand to mitigate  extended disruption in supply chains such that production  and delivery of product to customer can be maintained.  Economic  downturn  Adverse global or country specific economic conditions  may potentially have an adverse effect on Calix’s revenue.  Any significant downturns in investment in research and  development and/or commercialisation may result in  a reduction in research and development activity and/  or demand for Calix’s solutions, potentially resulting in a  slowing down or failure to deliver the Company’s plans  and financial performance.  While global or country specific economic conditions are  and will remain outside Calix’s control, the Company closely  monitors economic conditions. The diverse applications  of Calix’s core platform technology into multiple markets  and geographies can help to mitigate the effects of an  economic downturn. Additionally, Calix’s strong balance  sheet and commercial models provide the Company  with flexibility to pursue a diverse capital strategy for  investment across its lines of business.  Foreign exchange  Calix is exposed to movements in exchange rates, due  to a portion of its revenues and costs being sourced  globally. As Calix expands internationally, a greater foreign  exchange risk is foreseen.  If, and when, the Board considers it appropriate, financial  instruments can be used to manage foreign exchange risk  for the Company.  Capital  requirements  Calix may be exposed to potential changes in its ability to  access funding in the future, whether through regulatory  change, failure in grant funding, cost overruns, or failure  to generate and grow revenues, which may impact the  ability of the business to carry out some or all of its  current activities.  Integrated activities to influence governments, industry,  investors and other stakeholders help to create favourable  market conditions, including favourable public policy  settings and demand for Calix’s solutions. These activities  also provide the information necessary to monitor  this risk. High standards of corporate governance and  reporting provide transparency, as well as accurate and  timely information to the Company. Additionally, Calix’s  strong balance sheet and commercial models provide  the Company with flexibility to pursue the right capital  strategy for each investment opportunity across its lines  of business.  Principal environmental risks  Climate change  Calix recognises the risks and opportunities climate  change presents for the planet, society, industry  and its business. These include transitional risks and  opportunities associated with the transition to a  low-carbon economy, as well as physical risks such as  disruption and damage to business operations, assets  and supply chains and/or broader impacts such as  environmental stress and water security.  To further understand the material risks and resilience  of Calix’s strategy and business model, the Company will  conduct a climate-related scenario analysis in FY25. This  exercise will provide Calix with additional, robust insights  into a range of plausible future states for consideration  against the Company's strategic areas of focus, investment  decisions and planning. The outputs of the analysis will also  inform the development of Calix's climate transition plan.  Our climate transition plan will communicate the Company’s  strategy as the global economy moves towards net  zero, including a roadmap to achieving Calix's emissions  reduction goals. The Company will share the outcomes of  its climate assessments and transition planning in its FY25  reporting suite.  17  PERFORMANCE  REMUNERATION  RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS  SHAREHOLDERS  COMPLIANCE  OTHER  RISK MANAGEMENT   ===== PAGE 20 ===== Risk  Description  Mitigation  Principal social risks  Safety  Research and development of Calix’s core platform  technology, in addition to the operation and  management of Calix’s solutions at its sites or its  customers and partners’ sites carries inherent safety  risks, including illness, injury and death. Major hazards  include handling and testing of hazardous materials.  Failing to effectively manage this risk could result in a  catastrophic event or other long-term damage. While  not considered major hazards, other significant risks at  Calix’s sites include falling objects and falls from height.  The health and safety of Calix’s employees, contractors,  visitors and anyone who could be affected by the conduct  of its business is the Company’s primary operational  focus. Building a culture of health and safety first is core  to achieving the Key Performance Indicators set by the  Board as part of the Company’s Safety, Health, Environment  and Quality Action Plan, which are the first performance  Gateway for the Company’s Employee Incentive Scheme.  Calix’s safety management system operates across the  Company globally. Additionally, Calix’s Safety Management  system is independently accredited under ISO 45001, the  International Standard for Work Health and Safety Systems  in Victoria and Queensland. Calix employees complete safety  training, which is reinforced and supported by frequent,  ongoing safety initiatives. All injuries, incidents and serious  near misses are thoroughly investigated and reported to the  Board to help prevent reoccurrence and ensure continual  improvement to Calix’s safety management system.  Community  acceptance of  Carbon Capture,  Use and Storage  Community and public acceptance help to ensure each  site at which Calix’s technology is deployed has a social  licence to operate. Historically, Carbon Capture, Use  and Storage (CCUS) projects have had challenges with  public acceptance, complicated by the variety of types of  CCUS proposed, their cost and technical viability, and the  perception that CCUS was being deployed to prolong  the use of fossil fuels. These concerns have led to some  scepticism and cynicism in public attitudes towards  CCUS that could delay or prevent the implementation  of Calix and its subsidiaries’ plans, leading to adverse  financial impacts.  Calix and its subsidiaries develop community benefits  plans to support new projects, which include detailed  stakeholder analysis and proactive and targeted public  engagement campaigns to improve public understanding  and acceptance. Tactics include establishment of visitor  centres, dedicated and multi-lingual project webpages,  educational materials, video and social media content, and  local partnerships. Furthermore, Calix’s project delivery  model utilises technology licensing, with implementation by  local firms using local resources. This augments the project’s  benefits by creating socio-economic benefits for local  communities, in addition to the environmental and health  benefits enabled by the technology.  Internal audit  Calix has adopted internal control procedures in accordance with the Company’s Risk Management Policy. Calix’s internal controls include  clear and approved authorisation limits for all expenditure and payments, a dual-approval process for all payments, and cash flow forecasts  with materiality thresholds that are regularly reviewed, in addition to reviews of its other financial materiality thresholds.  The Board, with support from the ARMC and senior management, is charged with evaluating and considering improvements to Calix’s risk  management and internal control processes on an ongoing basis. Additionally, internal audits are performed to ensure compliance with safety  and quality certification requirements.  Assurances by management  The Board received declarations from the Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer during the reporting period  in accordance with section 295A of the Corporations Act and Recommendation 4.2 of the ASX Principles and Recommendations.

Leilac & Heirloom signed global  licence and collaboration  agreements for Direct Air Capture  Leilac signed a binding and perpetual  global licence agreement and a  collaboration agreement with Direct Air  Capture (DAC) company, Heirloom, for  the exclusive use of Leilac's technology  by Heirloom for carbon dioxide  removal by DAC. Under the terms of  the agreement, Leilac will receive a  royalty based on the value of the CO2  captured with the technology. Carbon  dioxide removal in the order of 1 10  billion tonnes per annum is expected 1  to be needed to limit or return global  warming to 1.5°C, as committed to in  the Paris Agreement.  Sustainable lithium demonstration  plant with Pilbara Minerals passed  Final Investment Decision  A Mid-Stream Demonstration Plant  developed in a Unincorporated Joint  Venture between Calix and Pilbara  Minerals (ASX: PLS) passed its Final  Investment Decision. Supported  by $20m in Australian Government  funding, the plant at Pilbara Minerals  Pilgangoora operation will use Calixs  patented electric calcination technology  to demonstrate an innovative refining  process for sustainable lithium.  ZESTY produced green iron  from multiple Pilbara ores, and  first green iron briquettes  Calix concluded an expansive ore  testing program, including over  130 tests from nine different iron  ores. The results demonstrated  the production of green iron at  commercial grades, including for  low grade Australian hematite and  goethite ores. The green iron fines  produced by Zero Emissions Steel  TechnologY (ZESTY) were also  successfully processed into the  first ZESTY green iron briquettes  with highly encouraging properties,  demonstrating the potential to  produce a green Hot Briquetted Iron  (HBI) product for export.  Leilac-2 relocated to Heidelberg  Materials’ cement plant in Ennigerloh, Germany  Following Heidelberg Materials’ (FWB: HEI)  decision to end clinker production in  Hanover, Germany, Heidelberg Materials  cement plant in Ennigerloh, Germany was  selected as the new site for Leilac-2. With  the aim of demonstrating a replicable  module to efficiently capture up to  100,000 tonnes per year of unavoidable  process carbon dioxide emissions released  during cement and lime production,  Leilac-2 has delivered a robust detailed  design with construction expected to  commence promptly following permitting.  ZESTY study finds green iron solution with high  economic potential  With funding support from the Australian  Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), Calix  completed a Front-End Engineering and  Design (FEED) study for a 30,000 tonne  per annum ZESTY Hydrogen Direct  Reduced Iron (H2-DRI) demonstration  plant.

We are proud to  be using our unique mineral processing technology to create great businesses  and innovative solutions that help deliver a more sustainable future for societies,  industry and the planet. To this end, we are pleased to present the Calix Limited  Annual Report for the 2024 Financial Year (FY24).  FY24 was another challenging and turbulent year for financial markets, in particular  for equity markets associated with the Environment, Social and Governance (ESG)  investment thematic. Nonetheless, strong support for industrial decarbonisation  continues to grow.  Iron and steel perhaps best encapsulates the risks and opportunities of  decarbonisation for Australia. Australia produces over 50% of the world’s iron  ore 1, and iron ore dominates Australia’s export earnings 2 . Almost all Australian  ore, however, is of the hematite / goethite variety 3, considered low-grade and not  suitable for use in the electric arc furnaces that are expected to dominate the  future of steelmaking. Ensuring the compatibility of Australian iron ore with future  low-carbon steelmaking must therefore be a national priority.  With iron and steel being responsible for 8% of global CO2 emissions, or around  eight times the total emissions Australia produces domestically, decarbonisation  of this sector offers a meaningful opportunity beyond our borders. Furthermore,  turning iron ore into green iron can enable the capture of significantly more value  from Australia’s resources, not just protecting them from climate risks, but seizing  the economic opportunities that global decarbonisation readily presents.  Thankfully, Australia is abundant in both iron ore and renewable energy resources.  Combining government support, industry commitments and enabling technology  like Calix’s Zero Emissions Steel TechnologY (ZESTY) can help Australia seize the  opportunity to turn its iron ore into green iron.  Beyond iron ore, alumina, lithium and other critical minerals, as well as metals  such as magnesium, all require sustainable processing solutions compatible with  renewable energy sources. Given Australia’s comparative advantage in these  minerals, we believe the opportunity for Australia is clear.  The $22.7 billion “Future Made in Australia” package will back some of these  enormous opportunities with government support. The package includes measures  to drive down the cost of renewable energy and green hydrogen and a $1.7  billion “Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund” to support green metals and  low-carbon liquid fuels. This support is in addition to the Safeguard Mechanism,  National Reconstruction Fund, Powering the Regions Fund, Carbon Capture  Technologies Program and Critical Minerals Facility. A Carbon Border Adjustment  Mechanism (CBAM) is also under review.

Europe introduced a CBAM,  facilitating the gradual cessation of free  CO2 allowances for the European Union  (EU) Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) for  heavy industry. The EU ETS price bounced  from a low of €50  driven by a dip in  economic activity and the impacts of the  war in Ukraine  to finish the financial year  at €70. Longer term forecasts predict EU  ETS prices of around €200 by 2035 1 . The  free allowances will start to be phased out  in 2026, and by 2034, every tonne of CO2  emitted by industrial facilities in Europe, or  from goods imported into Europe, will be  exposed to, and liable for the prevailing EU  ETS price.  In the USA, bipartisan support for Carbon  Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS)  and Direct Air Capture (DAC) continues. Tax  incentives, introduced in 2008 by the Bush  administration and enhanced by the Biden  administration’s Inflation Reduction Act,  provide significant reward for the capture of  CO2 from industry and the atmosphere.  Leilacs DAC partner, Heirloom, had their  federal government funding for projects  in Louisiana enhanced by additional State  Government funding. Heirloom’s planned  facilities in Louisiana are part of Project  Cypress, supported by up to US$600m in  funding under the Bipartisan Infrastructure  Law. Heirloom will also receive up to  US$10m from the Republican Louisiana  State Government. Leilac and Heirloom  have signed an exclusive global licence  agreement for the use of the Leilac  technology in Heirloom’s DAC process, and  Leilac is already being paid to engineer two  projects, including one for Project Cypress.  In Asia, momentum for carbon accounting  and trading is emerging, with India, Malaysia,  Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and others  introducing regulatory frameworks for future  ETS launches.  Together, these policies speak volumes for  the strong support globally for industrial  decarbonisation and the technology  solutions that will achieve the necessary  change. The policies make evident the need  for urgent, cost-effective and scalable  solutions that balance social, economic  and environmental sustainability to solve  some of the greatest global challenges of  our time.  Focused delivery  Calix finished FY24 well positioned to  capitalise on these global tailwinds, having  focused on and delivered significant  milestones on the path to commercial  returns across all its lines of business.  In Calix’s Carbon Capture business, Leilac,  engineering revenues jumped from $0.1m in  FY23 to $3.2m in FY24, driven by advancing  its pipeline of opportunities into paid  studies and work. In the Magnesia business,  sales and services revenue increased  14% from FY23 to $21.0m, driven largely  by growth in the U.S. at increased gross  margin. And in the Sustainable Processing  business, continued on-time and on-budget  development of our Unincorporated Joint  Venture project with Pilbara Minerals  (ASX: PLS) is setting this business up for  its first major revenues.  This focused delivery is reflected in our  group financial results. In FY24, Calix  achieved a gross profit of $10.3m, up from  $6.2m in FY23, driven by a 30% increase in  products and services revenue to $24.2m.  Additionally, Calix realised a gain of $12.2m  in FY24 from its UJV with Pilbara Minerals.  This gain is a result of Calix’s free-carried  equity in the UJV's demonstration plant  and recognises the value of our intellectual  property contribution. Calix finished the  financial year with $43m cash on hand,  down just 10% from 31 December 2023,  despite continued investment in capability  and key project delivery.  It is pleasing to see growth and  diversification in our revenue streams,  especially in revenue contributions from the  Leilac business. This growth reflects growing  demand for paid engineering studies and  materials testing with our core technology,  underscoring both the technology’s  potential and the growing industrial push  to decarbonise, notwithstanding the  current market conditions. Importantly,  these new and growing revenue streams  provide great cash support as we develop  the technology prior to the commencement  of licensing royalties.  Throughout FY24, Calix continued its  planned investment in people, plant and  equipment, focused on the delivery of its  priority projects. These are the Mid-Stream  Demonstration Plant in a UJV with Pilbara  Minerals, scale up of ZESTY from pilot to  demonstration scale, the development of  a replicable and retrofittable module for  cement and lime decarbonisation with  Leilac-2, and DAC projects with Heirloom.  Whilst Calix’s platform technology can be  deployed in many directions, we continue to  employ considerable discipline as to where  we direct our capital, people and focus.  The determining factor is profitable growth.  We direct our attention to projects which  can launch new revenue streams, provide  material revenue uplift at attractive margins  and where we generate the best return for  allocating our capital.  Our investments in FY24 were  supplemented by $5.2m in grants and tax  rebates from governments in the various  countries in which we operate. In addition,  a grant from the Australian Government  supported the development of a new  electric calciner at Calix’s Technology Centre  that will increase the Company’s capacity  for technology development and material  testing for commercial, paid projects.  More commercial milestones  In addition to significantly growing and  diversifying our revenue streams, our  dedicated team has delivered significant  commercial progress against the Company’s  key milestones in FY24, including:  A signed JV agreement between Leilac  and Heidelberg Materials (FWB: HEI) for  Leilac-2;  The relocation of Leilac-2 to Heidelberg  Materials’ cement plant in Ennigerloh,  Germany;  Signed global licence and collaboration  agreements between Leilac and leading  U.S. DAC company, Heirloom;  The development of two DAC projects  with Heirloom in Louisiana, USA;  The start of construction of Calix’s  sustainable lithium demonstration plant  in UJV with Pilbara Minerals, following a  successful Final Investment Decision (FID)  and detailed design engineering;  The completion of pilot scale testing for  ZESTY, which produced green iron from  multiple ores, and the first green iron  briquettes; and  The completion of the ZESTY  demonstration plant Front-End  Engineering and Design (FEED) study,  which found ZESTY has the potential to  deliver an economical green iron solution,  even at demonstration scale and without  accounting for the price of carbon.

Other significant progress included:  Successful completion of a pre-FEED  study for Calix’s Zero Emissions Alumina  (ZEAL) technology;  Opening of new hydration facilities in  Wisconsin and Texas to boost our U.S.  Magnesia business capacity;  Completion of a study confirming Calix’s  bioactive magnesium oxide materials  provide quantifiable control of pathogenic  and drug-resistant bacteria; and  Commissioning of a new electric calciner  at the Calix Technology Centre to increase  the Company’s research and development,  and business development capabilities.  Further information on each of these  projects can be found in the FY24 highlights  and business updates contained in this  Annual Report, as well as within the new  investor centre on the Calix website.  Looking ahead  In FY25, we will prioritise completing  construction and commissioning of Calix's  sustainable lithium demonstration plant with  Pilbara Minerals, breaking ground on the  Leilac-2 plant in Ennigerloh, Germany with  Heidelberg Materials, and breaking ground  on the first commercial scale DAC facility  with Heirloom in the U.S. The successful  commissioning of these plants will pave the  way to our first licensing revenues from the  lithium, cement and DAC applications.  We also hope to pass the FID point for Calix’s  ZESTY demonstration plant. Following the  completion of our pilot-scale testing and  FEED study in FY24, we made significant  progress on establishing the location,  hydrogen supply, iron ore supply, green  iron offtake, and project finance required  for a ZESTY demonstration plant. FY25 will  see a continued and concerted effort to  progress a ZESTY demonstration plant to  FID and beyond.  Another priority in FY25 is our zero  emissions lime and cement demonstration  plant in South Australia. It is off to a great  start with the award of a $15m grant from  the Australian Government. This innovative  carbon capture and use project aims to  generate revenue through two products  zero emissions lime sold via our partners,  and captured CO2 for use by the Solar  Methanol 1 project to produce low-carbon  fuel for shipping.  As we work to deliver Calix’s key priority  projects and turn licence agreements into  royalty payments, we will also prioritise  revenue growth and diversification from  Calixs Magnesia business as well as paid  engineering studies. Our commercialisation  strategy is designed to provide flexible  funding options at a subsidiary and project  level to accelerate the technology’s  deployment in large addressable markets  and deliver commercial success as early  as possible.  Capital strategy  Calixs balance sheet, growing revenue  streams and cost management discipline  provide the cash support needed for  current operations and technology  development.

Leilac’s technology efficiently separates  unavoidable carbon emissions ready  for use or storage, without additional  chemicals or processes. It is designed to be  scalable, retrofittable, energy agnostic and  electrification ready, to provide flexible and  economical pathways to low-carbon cement  and lime.  Through the production of zero emissions  lime, Leilac also aims to support the  decarbonisation of other hard-to-abate  sectors, as well as removing carbon dioxide  from the atmosphere through Direct  Air Capture (DAC).  Operating across Europe, the Americas and  Asia Pacific, Leilac has imagined the future  for sustainable industry. And we’re creating  it. Today.  Market trends  In FY24, government policies and  regulation continued to support industrial  decarbonisation commitments around  the world.  In Europe, the introduction of a Carbon Border  Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) enabled the  European Union (EU) to announce the phasing  out of free allowances to its Emissions Trading  System (ETS). Hard-to-abate industries,  including cement and lime, will have their  free allowances reduced 48.5% by 2030  and 100% by 2034.  The European Commission released a  2040 Roadmap recommending 90%  CO2 reduction by 2040. To support this  target, an Industrial Carbon Management  Strategy outlined support for industrial  decarbonisation, including by carbon  capture, use and storage of industrial and  atmospheric carbon dioxide, building on the  Net-Zero Industry Act.  In the U.S., tax incentives for Carbon  Capture Use and Storage (CCUS) and DAC  continued to receive bipartisan support.  Tax credits under section 45Q of the U.S.  tax code provides US$85 per tonne of CO2  captured and permanently stored from  industry, and US$180 per tonne of CO2  removed from the atmosphere by DAC.  The development of Emissions Trading  Systems and carbon pricing continued to  grow momentum in the Asia Pacific, with  India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam  and other countries introducing regulatory  frameworks to support future ETS launches.  In Australia, the Safeguard Mechanism  requires large industrial facilities to reduce  their emissions in line with national targets  and puts a price on emissions beyond  this cap. The Australian Government’s  Carbon Capture Technologies Program is  also providing support for industrial CCUS  projects, particularly those focused on  cement and lime.  FY24 achievements  Leilac-2  The EU funded Leilac-2 project aims to  demonstrate a replicable and retrofittable  module capable of efficiently capturing up  to 100,000 tonnes per year of unavoidable  process carbon dioxide emissions released  during cement and lime production, while  operating on low-cost and lower carbon  alternative fuels. As such, it represents  an important demonstration and scale up  step to enable full-scale and industry-wide  deployment of the Leilac technology.  Following Heidelberg Materials’ (FWB:  HEI) decision to end clinker production in  Hanover, Germany, the Leilac-2 project  was successfully relocated to Heidelberg  Materials’ cement plant in Ennigerloh,  Germany 1. The rapid relocation of the  project was testament to the robust  and replicable technology design and  the commitment of the project team.  Construction of the Leilac-2 plant is  expected to commence in 2025 and  commissioning of the plant is expected to  occur in mid-2026.  Leilac and Heidelberg Materials also formed  a Joint Venture (JV) for the construction,  operation and future transfer of ownership  of the Leilac-2 demonstration plant  at Heidelberg Materials’ cement plant  in Ennigerloh, Germany 2. In parallel  with the construction of Leilac-2, both  companies have committed to exploring  the development of a full-scale commercial  installation. Heidelberg Materials and  Leilac have previously signed a global  licence agreement covering all plants  where the Leilac technology is used,  including Leilac-2 3.   ===== PAGE 19 ===== Commencing site works at Heidelberg Materials’ cement plant in  Ennigerloh, Germany for Leilac-2.

Carbon dioxide  removal in the order of 1-10 billion tonnes per annum is  expected to be needed to limit or return global warming to  1.5°C, as committed to in the Paris Agreement 1.  In October 2023, Leilac signed a binding and perpetual  global licence agreement and a collaboration agreement  with DAC company, Heirloom, for the exclusive use of Leilac's  technology by Heirloom for carbon dioxide removal by DAC 2.  Under the terms of the agreement, Leilac will receive a royalty  based on the value of the CO2 captured with the technology.  Electric and renewably powered versions of the Leilac  technology will first be installed at Heirloom’s DAC facilities in  Shreveport, Louisiana, USA. A first facility will aim to capture  ~17,000 tons 3 of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere per  year, with operations expected to commence by 2026. A  second co-located facility is Heirloom’s contribution to Project  Cypress, a U.S. Department of Energy-supported DAC Hub  eligible for up to US$600m in government funding under the  Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This second facility aims to  scale incrementally to capture ~300,000 tons 3 of CO2 from  the atmosphere each year, with the first 100,000 tons per  annum of capture capacity expected to come online in 2027.  Business growth  In FY24, Leilac’s team of industry experts and specialists grew  to 70. Located in 13 countries and speaking 25 languages,  Leilac has built a world-class team ready to support the global  deployment of the technology to cement, lime and DAC.  In FY24, Leilac focused on advancing its priority projects  and finished the financial year with 82 projects in its pipeline.  Advancing the pipeline of opportunities into paid studies  and work generated engineering revenues of $3.2m in FY24,  up from $0.1m in FY23.  –  –  –  –  ALIGNMENT WITH THE SUSTAINABLE  DEVELOPMENT GOALS  “Carbon Capture and Storage plays a major role in decarbonizing  the industry sector in the context of 1.5°C and 2°C pathways,  especially in industries with higher process emissions, such as  cement.” SR1.5. Chapter 2. IPCC. 2018.  Leilac is the collaborative technology partner seeking to enable a  sustainable future for cement and lime in a net-zero world. Our  potentially lowest cost carbon abatement solution aims to equip  producers to take urgent action against climate change and  protect their industries’ jobs and prosperity.  Like the Sustainable Development Goals (Global Goals), Calix  recognises the need to balance social, economic and environmental  sustainability.

Calixs patented core platform technology  uses indirect radiative heating to process  raw minerals into low carbon mineral  products. Efficient and precise electric  heating, fully compatible with renewable  energy sources, replaces inefficient  combustion of fossil fuels. Calix’s Zero  Emissions Steel TechnologY (ZESTY) pairs  electric heating with green hydrogen as a  reducing agent to replace coal and produce  green iron and steel.  Processing minerals at the mine site can  also offer a new paradigm in sustainable  mineral production, including enhanced  ore recovery, fewer processing steps,  zero-waste, rationalised supply chains, and  reduced transport costs.  Market trends  In Australia, the $22.7 billion Future Made in  Australia package 1 was introduced, targeting  priority industries such as green metals  that will have a comparative advantage as  the global economy transitions to net zero.  The package outlines support for renewable  energy, green hydrogen, critical minerals, and  the production of green metals such as iron  and aluminium, including a $1.7 billion Future  Made in Australia Innovation Fund to support  green metals and low-carbon liquid fuels.  This Australian Government support is  in addition to the Safeguard Mechanism,  $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund,  $1.9 billion Powering the Regions Fund, and  $4 billion Critical Minerals Facility. A Carbon  Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is  also under review.  Like cement, the iron and steel industry in  Europe will see its free allowances to the  European Union Emissions Trading Scheme  (EU ETS) phased out 48.5% by 2030 and  100% by 2034, following the introduction of  a CBAM.  In Asia Pacific, China is expected to add  cement, steel and alumina to its ETS, and  the China Certified Emission Reduction  voluntary carbon market is expected to be  restarted 2 . Prices are expected to remain  low before increasing, as emissions peak  closer to 2030.  ETS momentum is emerging across Asia  Pacific, with India, Malaysia, Indonesia,  Thailand, Vietnam and other countries  introducing regulatory frameworks for future  ETS launches.  FY24 achievements  Zero Emissions Steel TechnologY  Pilot-scale ZESTY trials using the electric  ‘BATMn’ calciner at the Calix Technology  Centre in Bacchus Marsh, Australia,  continued throughout much of FY24, with  over 130 tests from nine different Australian  iron ores completed.3  Most test runs at the targeted temperature  range achieved the level of metallisation  suitable for downstream use in either a  melter or blast furnace, while several tests  reached sufficient metallisation levels for  feed directly to an electric arc furnace.  Importantly, this included low-grade  hematite and goethite ores that account  for 96% of Australian iron ore exports 4 ,  or 50% of global iron ore supply 5 and are  not otherwise suited to use in an electric  arc furnace.  The ZESTY H2-DRI (Hydrogen Direct  Reduced Iron) fines have been successfully  processed into the first ZESTY green  iron briquettes with highly encouraging  properties, demonstrating the potential to  produce a green Hot Briquetted Iron (HBI)  product for export.  With funding support from the Australian  Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), Calix  completed a Front-End Engineering and  Design (FEED) study for a 30,000 tonne per  annum ZESTY green iron demonstration  plant 6 . The study found that even at  demonstration scale, ZESTY has the  potential to produce near-zero emissions  HBI from low grade iron ore for close to  the cost of existing, carbon-intensive HBI  processing costs 7, before any benefit of  emissions reduction is accounted for. A  Final Investment Decision on a ZESTY  HBI demonstration facility is being  progressed and is subject to plant location  and commercial agreements currently  under negotiation.

Calix’s technology is energy agnostic  and electrification-ready, providing  sustainable and economical  pathways for industrial processes to  transition to clean energy sources,  including renewable electricity.  From electrification, to enabling  green steel through hydrogen  reduction, to reducing the waste  and CO2 footprint of mineral  processing with innovative  refining solutions, Calix is enabling  sustainable industrial processing.   ===== PAGE 22 ===== Business overview  Calixs magnesium-based products deliver  safe, sustainable and effective solutions for  global environmental challenges.  For water treatment, aquaculture and  wastewater management, Calix’s magnesium  hydroxide liquid products stabilise alkalinity  and reduce pollution of our water systems.  They provide a sustainable and cost- effective alternative to caustic soda.  The unique bioactive properties of Calixs  high surface area magnesium oxide  materials are also enabling the development  of novel solutions for crop protection in  agriculture, non-toxic marine coatings,  and non-lethal alternatives to biocides  and antibiotics for the prevention of  antimicrobial resistance.  Leveraging its platform technology for  sustainable mineral processing and capture  of unavoidable carbon dioxide emissions,  Calixs magnesia business is also developing  sustainable processing solutions for  magnesium metal, a critical mineral used in  lightweight metal alloys.  Market trends  The effective and sustainable treatment  of water is imperative to improved public  health outcomes, economic activity and  protecting natural ecosystems.  Increased regulation of nitrogen removal  in wastewater is creating support for  solutions that boost alkalinity and maintain  effective microorganism activity. For the  potable water market, strengthened  regulation on residual lead and copper  requires alternative pH control solutions to  minimise the corrosivity of water within the  distribution system.  In agriculture, reducing dependence on  lethal chemical pesticides continues to be  an important challenge. Existing chemicals  and pesticides are being deregistered,  or regulations around when and how  they can be used are becoming tighter.  This regulation follows recognition that  conventional pesticides are often toxic 1, can  persist and accumulate in the environment 2 ,  reduce biodiversity 3, and are becoming  less effective through the development of  target resistance 4 .  Antimicrobial resistance is now a rapidly  emerging global crisis following many years  of antibiotic overuse. It is projected to cost  the global economy US$100 trillion and  cause 10 million deaths per year by 2050 5 .  FY24 achievements  In FY24, the Magnesia business recorded  revenues of $21.0m and gross profit of $7.0m,  up 13.7% and 15.5% from FY23 respectively.  Water  IER, Calix’s water and wastewater treatment  subsidiary in the USA, boosted its capacity  with the opening of new hydration facilities  in Ripon, Wisconsin and Lufkin, Texas. The  new plants supported the expansion of sales  into new regions, including Wisconsin, Illinois  and Texas, as well as new business in the  existing regions of the Pacific Northwest  and Upper Midwest.  The demand for additional capacity follows  the development of ALKA-Mag+, a safe,  sustainable and cost-effective alternative  to caustic soda. In addition to the new  facilities, IER grew and strengthened its  team to support further business growth.

Directors  The following persons were directors of the Company during  the whole of the year ended 30 June 2024 and up to the date  of the report, unless otherwise stated:  Peter Turnbull, AM  Alison Deans  Peter Dixon (appointed 1 January 2024)  Helen Fisher  Dr Sarah Ryan (appointed 1 January 2024)  Dr Phil Hodgson  Dr Mark Sceats  Principal activities  Calix Limited (ASX: CXL) is an environmental technology  company solving urgent global challenges in industrial  decarbonisation and sustainability.  Calix’s unique patented core platform technology delivers indirect  heating of raw materials to enable efficient, precise, flexible  and renewably powered mineral processing and capture of  unavoidable industrial emissions.  With strong and increasing demand driven by global  decarbonisation commitments, Calix is applying its core  technology to the cement, steel, alumina and critical minerals  industries, as well as the direct air capture of atmospheric carbon  dioxide, and the production of sustainable environmental products.  Leveraging its core platform technology and a global network of  partners, Calix is urgently developing multiple businesses that  deliver positive global impact.  Technology  Calix’s platform technology is a reinvention of the kiln process  with three core benefits:  Capture of unavoidable emissions: unavoidable process CO2  emissions from cement and lime production and CO2 from the  atmosphere are captured for use or storage.  Electrification and renewable energy-ready: compatible with  electricity and alternative fuels to provide viable, flexible and  economical pathways to sustainable processing.  Highly-active materials: produces high purity / active materials  with enhanced chemical and/or bioactivity.  Operations  The Group has operations, customers and distribution partners  across Australia, New Zealand, Asia, Europe and the United States  of America (“US”). Its activities in the 2024 Financial Year (“FY24”)  were focused across three business segments, being: Leilac  (CO2 mitigation), Sustainable Processing, and Magnesia. These  “lines of business” are supported by Research & Development  (“R&D”), engineering, operations, marketing, and finance and  administration teams.  Our business activities are underpinned by:  A commercial-scale operations facility – the Calix Technology  Centre – at Bacchus Marsh in Victoria, Australia with a  name-plate capacity of 25,000 tonnes per year of raw  (magnesium oxide) product;  A raw material (magnesium carbonate) mine near Leigh Creek  in South Australia;  A pilot demonstration facility for CO2 capture from lime and  cement (“Leilac-1” facility) in Lixhe, Belgium;  Two electric calciners for sustainable processing development  and the production of advanced materials at the Calix  Technology Centre; and  Six manufacturing facilities in the U.S. to produce water  treatment products to serve North American customers.  Operating results  In FY24, product revenues increased by 30% to $24.2m (FY23: $18.6m),  with gross margin growing to 43% (FY23: 33%) from the Magnesia  and Leilac lines of business. In FY24, Calix materially grew  the revenue stream associated with performing engineering  services in support of Leilac’s customers, contributing $3.2m.  Calix also realised a gain of $12.2m that resulted from Calix’s  free-carried equity in its unincorporated joint venture with  Pilbara Minerals (ASX: PLS).  The Company incurred expenditure of $41.9m (FY23: $31.7m) in  capability and capacity building to commercialise Calix’s platform  technology, particularly in the Leilac and Sustainable Processing  lines of business. This includes investment in additional research,  development and engineering, which accounted for 67% of the  total increase in operational expenditure. Calix concluded FY24  with 155 full-time employees (FY23: 123 full-time employees),  which includes 20 new engineers and scientists to support our  technology commercialisation, as well as new employees to  support customer projects.  Financial position  The Group held $43.0m in cash and cash equivalents at  30 June 2024 (30 June 2023: $74.5m) and had a surplus of  $27.0m of total current assets over total current liabilities  (30 June 2023: $68.2m). Calix’s strong balance sheet, including  its cash position and minimal debt, provides the capacity to  simultaneously pursue commercialisation opportunities in large  addressable markets across the Company’s lines of business.  Market conditions  Despite an otherwise challenging macroeconomic environment,  commitment to and investment in solutions that align with  Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) goals continues  to grow year-on-year as governments, industries and investors  look to achieve their decarbonisation goals and meet their  net-zero commitments.  In FY24, further policies to drive decarbonisation were  announced around the world, including:  Europe  Free allowances for the European Union Emissions Trading  Scheme (ETS) will be progressively phased out following the  introduction of a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).  Free allowances, including for cement, lime and steel producers,  will reduce 48.5% by 2030 and 100% by 2034.  The European Commission released a 2040 Roadmap  recommending a 90% CO2 reduction by 2040.  The European Commission published an Industrial Carbon  Management Strategy that outlined support for industrial  decarbonisation, including by carbon capture, use and storage  of industrial and atmospheric carbon dioxide.

India introduced the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS)  as a framework for an ETS launch.  In addition to the Safeguard Mechanism, Powering the Regions  Fund, National Reconstruction Fund, Critical Minerals Strategy  in Australia, and the Carbon Capture Technologies Program,  the Australian Government launched the Future Made in  Australia policy to maximise the economic and industrial  benefits of the energy transition. A CBAM is also under review.  These policies recognise the need for urgent, affordable and scalable  solutions that balance social, economic and environmental sustainability  to solve some of the greatest global challenges of our time.  Going concern  The financial report has been prepared on a going concern basis.  Significant changes in the state of affairs  There were no significant changes in the state of affairs of the  Group during the year.  Dividends  No dividends were paid or were payable during the year (2023: $NIL).  After balance date events  On 23 July 2024, Calix announced it had been awarded a $15  million grant from the Australian Government’s Carbon Capture  Technologies Program.

Further  information is available on Calix’s website in its investor centre  and the ASX market announcements platform.  No other matters or circumstances have arisen since the end of  the financial year which significantly affected, or may significantly  affect, the operations of the Group, the results of those  operations, or the state of affairs of the Group in future years.  Environmental regulation  The Group’s operations are subject to local, state and federal  environmental legislation and regulations in both the testing and  operational areas. The Calix Limited Board of Directors (“Board”)  is responsible for regular monitoring of environmental exposure  and compliance with environmental regulations and is not aware  of any breaches of these regulations during the year. The Group is  committed to achieving a high standard of environmental performance.  Indemnification and insurance of officers  During the financial year, the Company paid a premium to insure  the directors, officers and senior managers against certain  liabilities that may be incurred whilst they perform their duties  for the Company. This may include liabilities and costs associated  with defending civil or criminal proceedings brought against the  individuals in their capacity as officers of the entities in the Group.  Options, warrants and rights  At the date of this report, there were no unissued ordinary shares  of the Company under option, no warrants on issue and 5,739,820  share options on issue. Refer to Note 20 of the financial statements  for further details of the share options outstanding at balance date.  The details of options, warrants and rights issued to Key Management  Personnel as remuneration are set out in the Remuneration Report.  Proceedings on behalf of the company  No person has applied to the Court under section 237 of the  Corporations Act 2001 for leave to bring proceedings on behalf  of the Group or intervene in any proceedings to which the Group  is a party, for the purpose of taking responsibility on behalf of  the Group for all or any part of those proceedings.  Auditor  KPMG was appointed Auditor on 15 January 2024, following  a vote taken at the Companys Annual General Meeting held  on 16 November 2023 and ASICs consent to the resignation  of BDO Audit Pty Ltd in accordance with section 327 of the  Corporations Act 2001.  Non-audit services  The Group may decide to employ the auditor on assignments  additional to their statutory audit duties where the auditor’s expertise  and experience with the Company and/or Group are important.  The Group has not paid any amounts nor had any amounts  payable to the auditors for non-audit services during FY24.  In the prior year, when BDO Audit Pty Ltd acted as auditor,  the Group paid $29,348 to BDO for tax consulting services.  The Company’s Board would consider the provision of the  non-audit services by the auditor as to whether those services  are compatible with the general standard of independence  for auditors imposed by the Corporations Act 2001. Directors  were satisfied that the provision of non-audit services by the  auditors, as set out above, did not compromise the auditor  independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001  for the following reasons:  All non-audit services had been reviewed by the directors  to ensure they do not impair the impartiality and objectivity  of the audit; and  None of the services undermine the general principles relating  to auditor independence as set out in APES 110 Code of Ethics  for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards).  Auditor independence  A copy of the auditors independence declaration as required under  section 307c of the Corporations Act 2001 is set out on page 44.  Rounding off  The Group is of a kind referred to in ASIC Corporations (Rounding  in Financial/Directors’ Reports) instrument 2016/191 and in  accordance with that instrument, amounts in the consolidated  financial statements and directors’ report have been rounded off  to the nearest thousand dollars unless otherwise stated.  This report is signed in accordance with a resolution of the Board.

Further details on this year’s remuneration  outcomes, including the Companys KPI Dashboard, are provided in  this report.  Proposed new remuneration framework  The Board is committed to ensuring Calix’s remuneration  framework and the associated reward outcomes continue to  align with the Company’s business objectives, performance and  shareholder expectations.  Our approach to developing our remuneration framework is  designed to ensure we remain competitive in the global market,  attracting and retaining top talent despite our relatively smaller  size. By benchmarking our compensation packages against  industry standards, we aim to offer fair and attractive salaries  that reflect the value and expertise our employees bring to the  Company operating with a global footprint.  Accordingly, the People, Culture and Nominations Committee  engaged an external remuneration consultant to assist with the  design of a new framework to be implemented for FY25 and  beyond, but not for the FY24 period. The Board, based on advice  and recommendations provided by the external remuneration  consultant, has determined that a new remuneration framework  be adopted for the FY25 year and future years. The framework is a  more typical structure applied by listed companies. The framework  comprises a short-term and long-term performance component  that can be earned by KMP and senior executives, in addition  to fixed pay.  The following principles are being incorporated into the new framework:  Alignment of employees’ interests with Company strategies and  shareholders’ interests;  Enhanced alignment of the new framework with market practice;  Flexibility to allow adjustments based on market demand and  future growth;  Simplicity and transparency to ensure the new framework can  be easily explained and understood by stakeholders;  Features to attract, retain and motivate executives; and  Features to fairly and adequately reward individual and collective  high performance.  The details of the proposed new remuneration framework will be  outlined in the Notice of Meeting for Calix’s 2024 Annual General  Meeting (AGM).  I invite you to read our FY24 Remuneration Report to understand  how Calix is building alignment of employees’ interests with  shareholders’ interests to deliver long term shareholder value.  On behalf of the Company’s Directors, we look forward to  welcoming you and receiving your feedback at our 2024 AGM.  Peter Dixon  Chair  People, Culture and Nominations Committee  Dear Shareholders  On behalf of the Board of Directors of Calix Limited (the Board),  I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report for the year  ended 30 June 2024 (FY24).  It is a privilege to have been appointed Chair of the People, Culture  and Nominations Committee. I would like to take this opportunity  to recognise and thank Peter Turnbull for his dedication over the  past 15 years as a Non-Executive Director, ten years as Chair of  the Board, and the past ten years as Chair of the People, Culture  and Nominations Committee.  The Remuneration Report sets out the remuneration information  for directors of Calix Limited and its controlled entities, and  other Key Management Personnel (KMP), as well as providing a  summary of performance outcomes for FY24 and their associated  remuneration outcomes.  The key objectives of Calix’s remuneration policies are to align  Calix’s directors and employees, including KMP, with shareholders’  interests, while ensuring remuneration structures are fair and  competitive. The policies seek to balance incentives to achieve  annual short-term goals with incentives to create and execute  opportunities that build long-term shareholder value.  FY24 performance and reward outcomes  The Board is satisfied that the reward outcomes for FY24 reflect  the Company’s performance.  In FY24, Calix maintained a strong balance sheet, as well as  diversifying and growing its revenue. The expansion of Calix’s U.S.  Water business saw an increase in sales revenue and gross margin,  while Leilac and the Sustainable Processing lines of business  brought in new revenue streams.  In FY24, a focus on key projects delivered substantial milestones.  Calix’s sustainable lithium demonstration plant in Unincorporated  Joint Venture (UJV) with Pilbara Minerals (ASX: PLS) commenced  construction. Pilot scale testing and a Front-End Engineering and  Design (FEED) study for ZESTY were completed, delivering the  production of green iron from multiple ores and the first green  iron briquettes.  Leilac entered into a JV agreement with Heidelberg Materials  (FWB: HEI) for Leilac-2, signed global licence and collaboration  agreements with leading U.S. Direct Air Capture (DAC) company,  Heirloom, and announced the development of two DAC projects  with Heirloom in Louisiana, USA.  Further information on Calix’s financial performance and the  progress of key projects can be found in the Calix Limited Annual  Report, as well as the investor centre on the Calix website.  Under the terms of the Employee Incentive Scheme (EIS) applying  to FY24, three Performance Gateways, more details of which can  be found in this Remuneration Report, are used to determine  performance-vesting in each year and are applied sequentially.  When applying the performance criteria to FY24, the Board assessed:  1) Gateway 1: the performance against the Company’s annual  safety and quality action plan was met and achieved in full.  2) Gateway 2: the Total Shareholder Returns (TSR) performance  was not met.  3) Gateway 3: the Group’s Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were  assessed for the business as 7.6 out of 10.

This remuneration report sets out the remuneration information for directors of Calix Limited and its controlled entities (“the Group” or  “Calix”) consisting of Calix Limited (“the Company”) and entities under its control, and other Key Management Personnel (“KMP”). For the  purposes of this report, KMP of the Group is defined as those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and  controlling major activities of the Company and the Group, directly or indirectly, including any director of the Company.  The key objectives of the Group’s remuneration policies are to align Calix’s directors, KMP and employees with shareholders’ interests,  while ensuring remuneration structures are fair and competitive. The policies, including an Employee Incentive Scheme (“EIS”), seek  to balance incentives to achieve annual short-term goals with incentives to create and execute opportunities that build long-term  shareholder value. The EIS, in particular, is designed to balance these goals by providing employees with ‘at risk’ rewards for their  performance. Subject to performance requirements being met, employees receive awards that vest over a period of six years.  The directors’ policies for determining the nature and amount of remuneration for directors and KMP of the Group follow:  Non-executive director remuneration  Non-executive directors’ remuneration is approved by the Board of Directors (“the Board”) and shareholders. Remuneration is reviewed  annually, based on market practice, duties and accountability. Independent external advice is sought when required. The maximum aggregate  of fees that can be paid to non-executive directors is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”).  Non-executive directors  The following people were non-executive directors of the Group during the 2024 financial year (“FY24”) and, unless otherwise indicated,  were classified as non-executive directors for the entire year.  Peter Turnbull, AM, Independent Chair  Alison Deans, Independent Director  Peter Dixon, Independent Director (appointed 1 January 2024)  Helen Fisher, Independent Director  Dr Sarah Ryan, Independent Director (appointed 1 January 2024)  KMP salary and retirement benefits  All KMP, including the CEO, receive a base salary, which is based on factors such as experience, skills and competencies. The Board  reviews KMP base salary levels annually by reference to the Group’s performance, individual performance and comparable information  from industry sectors. All Australian-based KMP employees also receive a superannuation guarantee contribution, which for FY24 was 11%  (10.5% for FY23) up to the concessional contributions cap, and do not receive any other retirement benefits.  Employee incentives  An EIS is applied based upon performance of both the Group and individual Key Performance Indicators (“KPI”). The Board sets yearly  KPIs for the Group to drive performance, appropriately balancing current and future value creation, and reflecting the nature and  strategy of the Group. The actual performance against KPIs is reviewed regularly and assessed at the end of the financial year by the  People, Culture and Nominations Committee to determine EIS outcomes.  The EIS is a hybrid share-based scheme that combines both short-term and long-term incentives. It is designed to retain and motivate  Calix’s employees, building alignment of employees’ interests with shareholders’ interests to deliver shareholder value, consistent with  the nature and strategy of the Group.  Details of the mechanisms by which the EIS operates are further set out in the Remuneration Report.  KMP remuneration  The following executives of the Group were classified as KMP during FY24 and, unless otherwise indicated, were classified as KMP for  the entire year.

Calix’s success  into the future will be based on its ability to commercialise its intellectual property assets and to continue to innovate and find new ways  to apply its capability. To this end, team members need to strike the right balance between achieving annual short-term goals whilst also  working towards new opportunities to build shareholder value by leveraging Calix’s technology. Calix’s ‘at-risk’ EIS was designed to balance  these objectives, providing rewards for performance in the current year that accrue over the medium to longer term.  Background  On 18 April 2018, at an extraordinary general meeting, the shareholders of Calix approved an EIS to operate once the Company was listed.  The Calix Officers & Employees Incentive Scheme (“EIS”) provides for the grant of rights and/or options to eligible officers and employees  (as determined by the Board) and is intended to provide competitive, performance-based remuneration supporting retention, incentive  and reward, and alignment with shareholders. Non-executive and independent directors are not invited to participate in the EIS.  Key terms of the EIS have been published on the ASX and the scheme is summarised below:  Overview of the EIS  The EIS is a hybrid scheme that provides both short-term and long-term incentive to all employees, including KMP – aligning employees’  remuneration and interests with shareholders’ interests. For KMP and senior executives, each round of the scheme operates over a  six-year period (including the re-test period), with a maximum option pool approved by the Board in year zero, the first tranche of  awards vesting at the end of year one, and the final tranche of awards vesting on the sixth anniversary of the initial option award.  The EIS for KMP and senior executives is delivered by granting participants zero priced options. Performance-vesting of the granted  options is subject to a series of three Performance Gateways assessed in each year of the three-year performance period. At the end of  each year of the 3 year performance period, options that did not meet annual performance gates are subjected to re-testing based on  criteria for Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) performance. Any un-vested options that did not vest at their testing date can be re-tested  annually between the testing date and the end of the financial year immediately after this date. Details and worked examples of the  performance criteria and vesting schedules over the six-year period are provided in this report.  37  DIRECTORS' REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL REPORT OTHER FY25 PRIORITIES                                                                                                                           REMUNERATION REPORT  ’  –  –  — —  — —  '  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –  –   ===== PAGE 40 ===== REMUNERATION REPORT (AUDITED)  Overview of the EIS continued  The first round of the EIS was made available to all Calix employees, including KMP (but excluding non-executive directors), at the end  of 2018 with an ability to earn parcels of options over the proceeding five-year period to 30 June 2024. The scheme was extended in  2022 with an additional round made available with the ability to earn parcels of options over the proceeding five-year period (EIS 2). The  Board has determined that the current EIS scheme will be replaced in FY25 with a more traditional short-term and long-term incentive  performance rights plan.  The Board typically limits the number of shares over which options will be issued under the EIS to 2% of the total number of shares on  issue (i.e. undiluted) in any one year. Subject to any limitations that might apply under the Corporations Act 2001 or limits under ASIC class  order relief, there is no limit on the number of options that may be issued under the EIS. The actual percentage of options on issue will  fluctuate as a result of changes in staffing levels.  Individual incentives and performance criteria for KMP and Senior Executives  The maximum potential award under the EIS for each executive is based on a percentage of gross annual salary, with the proportion of  total remuneration ‘at risk’ increasing with executive responsibility. The maximum potential award per year for senior executives is 40% of  their gross salary, 50% for the Chief Science Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and 60% for the Chief Executive Officer.  The actual award each year is determined as a percentage of maximum potential award, based on the three performance gateways  detailed below (performance vesting). The actual award from each year then vests over the subsequent three-year period with one third of  the actual award vesting immediately and one third at the end of each subsequent year (tenure vesting).  In an illustrative example – a senior executive is allocated a maximum possible 90,000 options under the EIS at the start of the three-year  period, reflecting 120% (40% x 3) of the executive’s gross salary. Assuming an annual salary of $225,000 this results in an allocation of  $270,000. Assuming $3 per Calix ordinary share at the commencement of the scheme this results in an allocation of 90,000 zero priced  options at the start of the scheme. At the end of each of the first three years of the scheme, the maximum potential award is 30,000  options, with the actual award being subject to three performance gateways (performance vesting). The actual award for each year, then  vests subject to tenure, with one third able to vest immediately, and the remaining two thirds vesting in equal tranches over the next two  years (tenure vesting).  Performance Gateways  Three Performance Gateways are used to determine performance-vesting in each year and are applied sequentially:  Gateway 1 – SHEQ performance  Gateway 1 is achieving the Company’s Safety, Health, Environment, and Quality Action Plan KPIs as agreed with the Board each year. If  the Safety Health, Environment, and Quality Action Plan KPIs are not met, then options can be awarded for performance that year. This  Performance Gateway is designed to ensure that Safety, Health and Environmental performance of our team members and Quality of  our products and services remain paramount at all times. The Action Plan reflects International Standard ISO45001, against which the  Company is audited annually.  Gateway 2 – Share price performance  Gateway 2 assesses absolute share price performance over the year as measured by Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”), as described  below. TSR is measured as Calix’s share price performance, being the 30-day Volume-Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) over the 15 days  preceding, and the 15 days after, June 30 in the prior financial year (“Baseline TSR”) as compared with the 30-day VWAP over the 15 days  preceding and the 15 days after 30 June in the current financial year (“Measured TSR”). If the Measured TSR for a particular financial year is  not higher than the Baseline TSR for that period of measurement, any options earned under Performance Gateway 3 (as described below)  remain unvested. However, such unvested options may vest if at any time before the end of the financial year immediately after each  testing period, the 30-day VWAP for Calix’s shares exceeds the applicable Baseline TSR for those unvested options. This mechanism is  designed to ensure that shorter-term goals or advances do not dominate over more significant, longer-term value creation opportunities,  so that KMP continue to balance shorter term outcomes with a longer-term view of outcomes for a multi-year, multi-application  value opportunity.  Gateway 3 – Performance against KPIs  Gateway 3 measures company and executive performance against KPIs agreed each year with the Board. These KPIs reflect the corporate  milestone targets set for each line of business, and are communicated to the market at regular times during the year via the Companys  market updates and the scheduled lodgment of its financial reports. Gateway 3 helps to drive achievement of annual performance metrics  that balance both short-term and long-term shareholder value creation.  The EIS options that have passed through all three gateways will be classed as “performance-vested”. These options will then be subject to  tenure-based vesting with one third vesting immediately. The other two thirds will then vest in two equal traches at the end of each of the  two full financial years following the performance year, provided the KMP or senior executive remains a full-time employee of the Company.  To continue the illustrative example above:  1) In year one, a KPI result of 7/10 was achieved, meaning 21,000 options have performance-vested for the senior executive above. Of  these 21,000 options, one third is immediately tenure-vested, while the remaining 14,000 options vest in equal tranches at one year and  two years after the performance year, provided the senior executive is still with the Company.  2) In year two, a KPI result of 6/10 was achieved, meaning 18,000 options have performance-vested. Of these 18,000 options, one third is  immediately tenure-vested, while the remaining 12,000 options vest in equal tranches at one year and two years after the performance  year, provided the senior executive is still with the Company.  3) In year three, a KPI result of 9/10 was achieved, meaning 27,000 options have performance-vested. Of these 27,000 options, one  third is immediately tenure-vested, while the remaining 18,000 options vest in equal tranches at one year and two years after the  performance year, provided the senior executive is still with the Company.

The Board would award those options if the team delivered a TSR performance measured as follows:  EIS 2 Tranche 1 (grant date in 2024) options where the Baseline TSR was $4.22:  50% of the remaining unvested options if the Measured TSR at the end of the performance vesting period has exceeded the 1 July 2023  Baseline TSR by 75%, being $7.38; and  The remaining 50% of the unvested options if the Measured TSR at the end of the performance vesting period has exceeded the  1 July 2023 Baseline TSR by 125%, being $9.50.  For the second and third Tranches of the EIS 2 (granted in 2024), if any options remain unvested (other than due to the timing of the grant  of such options), the Board will be able to perform a further performance review annually between end of FY25 to FY26. The Board will be  able to performance vest those options if the team has delivered a TSR performance, defined as follows:  EIS 2 Tranche 2 and 3 (grant date in 2024) options where the Baseline TSR was $4.22:  50% of the remaining unvested options if the Measured TSR at the end of the performance vesting period has exceeded the 1 July 2023  Baseline TSR by 75%, being $7.38; and  The remaining 50% of the unvested options if the Measured TSR at the end of the last performance vesting period has exceeded the  1 July 2023 Baseline TSR by 125%, being $9.50.  39  DIRECTORS' REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL REPORT OTHER FY25 PRIORITIES                                                  REMUNERATION REPORT  –  –  –  –   ===== PAGE 42 ===== REMUNERATION REPORT (AUDITED)  Performance Gateways continued  If TSR performance vested, these options will then be subject to tenure-based vesting over three years.  These provisions are a key mechanism to ensure that innovations that create long-term value for shareholders are rewarded, and that the  Company and KMP balance their focus on long-term value creation, while also delivering on shorter term KPIs focused on the foundations  of long-term value.  Following on from the illustrative example above, the table below shows how this further performance testing works:  Illustrative example: vesting of options  A maximum total of 90,000 options  are allocated to a senior executive  Vesting of each tranche of options under the initial allocation  of a 90,000 option pool for a senior executive  Beginning  year 1  End of  year 1  End of  year 2  End of  year 3  End of  year 4  End of  year 5  Tranche 1 earned options in year 1: 7/10 KPI result  7,000  7,000  7,000  Tranche 2 earned options in year 2: 6/10 KPI result  6,000  6,000  6,000  Tranche 3 earned options in year 3: 9/10 KPI result  9,000  9,000  9,000  Unearned options (24,000)  3,000 1  7,000 2  8,000 3  5,000 4  1,000 5  Total options earned and vested  7,000  13,000  22,000  15,000  9,000  If share price 75% above 1 July 2023 Baseline  50% of  3,000  = 1,500  50% of  7,000  = 3,500  50% of  8,000   4,000  50% of  5,000  = 2,500 6  If share price 125% above 1 July 2023 Baseline  50% of  3,000  = 1,500  50% of  7,000  = 3,500  50% of  8,000   4,000  50% of  5,000  = 2,500 6  1.

Claw back provision  In the event of fraud, dishonesty, or other material breaches of company policy, the Board reserves the right to reassess and reduce or  immediately lapse all unexercised options, whether vested or not.  The EIS and a takeover or change of control  If the Board recommends that a takeover bid be accepted by the Company’s shareholders or the Board determines that a transaction has  occurred that results in change of control, the Board may at its discretion, determine that any unvested options can vest and be exercised  and included in the equity transaction.  Vesting of options for performance to 30 June 2024  When applying the performance criteria for the period to 30 June 2024, the Board assessed the actual performance against the  performance vesting criteria as follows:  Gateway 1: performance against the Company’s annual safety and quality action plan was met and achieved in full.  Gateway 2: the TSR performance was not met.  Gateway 3: the Group KPIs were assessed for the business as 7.6 out of 10 (the KPI Dashboard for FY24 follows).  As a result of Gateway 2 not being met, the options granted for FY24 have not performance-vested at this point in time.  However, as outlined above, the Board will perform a further performance review in the following manner:  1. At the end of FY25, if the Measured TSR is above Baseline TSR, Gateway 2 will be met and the FY24 options will performance-vest. They  will then be subject to tenure-based vesting; or  2. At the end of FY25, if the team has delivered a superior TSR performance as defined in the further testing criteria, either 50% or 100% of  unearned options from FY24, under the second round of the EIS, will performance vest. They will then be subject to tenure-based vesting.

The Leilac-2 project team, in close collaboration  with Heidelberg Materials, IKN, and other project partners, worked quickly and effectively to assess and select a new site for the facility,  minimising impact to the project. Leilac successfully advanced two paid projects through its pipeline with Heirloom for Direct Air Capture,  as well as expanding the pipeline with several new projects in the scoping phase. Leilac also signed a global, perpetual licence agreement  with Heirloom, with a minimum royalty of US$3 per tonne of CO2 captured. The green methanol project, located in South Australia and in  collaboration with Vast and Mabanaft, was advanced with the Basis-of-Design completed. Following the close of FY24, Calix was awarded  a $15m grant from the Australian Government’s Carbon Capture Technologies Program to support the construction of the project.  In Sustainable Processing, construction commenced on time and budget for the spodumene processing demonstration plant developed  in a an unincorporated joint venture with Pilbara Minerals. An expanded ore testing program and Front-End Engineering Design (FEED)  study for a ZESTY demonstration facility for green iron were both successfully completed, with support from Australian Renewable  Energy Agency (ARENA) and in collaboration with the Heavy Industry Low-carbon Transition Cooperative Research Centre (HILT CRC).  Metallisation rates suitable for downstream use in either a melter or blast furnace were achieved from multiple ores from HILT CRC  member companies and beyond, while several tests reached sufficient metallisation levels for feed directly to an electric arc furnace.  A Final Investment Decision (FID) for the ZESTY demonstration plant has not yet been taken, as financing for the project is still being  progressed. A general pre-FEED study has been completed for an alumina demonstration facility following a successful test program and  a prospective techno-economic assessment conducted in collaboration with the HILT CRC.  In Advanced Batteries, commercial format packs have been produced and were installed in an electric scooter for further testing. An  assessment of the Advanced Batteries value proposition found that it mostly related to a process improvement. As such, the Advanced  Batteries business was incorporated into the Sustainable Processing line of business, with many activities paused and resources  redeployed to other immediate priorities. The Calix technology’s advantages for the manufacture of battery materials remain prospective  and will be pursued under the sustainable processing line of business.  The Water business was judged to have performed outstandingly, with substantial organic growth in revenue and increasing gross  margins, particularly in the USA. Two new magnesium hydroxide plants were successfully commissioned, increasing the total capacity of  the U.S. business by 50%. The business is well positioned for further growth in prospective markets.  In magnesium (Mg) metal – a patent was filed for a new production route for pure magnesium and the basis-of-design for a production  facility postponed while this intellectual property was developed. In Magnesia specialties, applications in health were pursued as part of  the Solving Antimicrobial Resistance in Agribusiness, Food, and Environments Cooperative Research Centre (“SAAFE CRC”) with early work  continuing to provide prospective results. Long-term testing of marine coatings applications in collaboration with a coating supplier and a  major end-customer continued successfully. Additionally, outstanding results were achieved in the agricultural application of BOOSTER- Mag in controlling fungal disease in olive trees.  After assessing the KPI contributions from each line of business, the Board determined a weighted average KPI score for the Group for  FY24 of 7.6 out of 10.  41  DIRECTORS' REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL REPORT OTHER FY25 PRIORITIES                                                                 REMUNERATION REPORT  -  ===== PAGE 44 ===== REMUNERATION REPORT (AUDITED)  The table below details certain measures in respect of the current financial year and previous four financial years that are monitored as  indicators of the performance of the Group.

Summary of material accounting policies  The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial report are set out below. The financial report covers the  consolidated group of Calix Limited (“the Company”) and its controlled entities (“the Group”).  Accounting policies are selected and applied in a manner that ensures that the resulting financial information satisfies the concepts of  relevance and reliability, thereby ensuring that the substance of the underlying transactions or other events is reported. Other material  accounting policies are contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements to which they relate.  The accounting policies have been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.  a) Basis of preparation  The financial report is a general purpose financial report that has been prepared in accordance and compliance with Australian Accounting  Standards (including Australian Accounting Interpretations) of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) and Corporations Act 2001  as appropriate for profit oriented entities; and therefore this financial report also complies with the International Financial Reporting  Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. The financial report was approved by the Calix Limited Board of  Directors on 27 August 2024.  i) Historical cost convention  The financial report has been prepared on an accrual basis and is based on historical costs, modified, where applicable by the  measurement at fair value of selected non-current assets, financial assets and financial liabilities.  ii) Critical accounting estimates  The preparation of financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise  its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity,  or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in Note 1(h).  b) Going concern  The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis which contemplates the continuity of normal business  activities and the realisation of assets and discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Group has incurred a loss after tax  for the year ended 30 June 2024 of $26.2m (30 June 2023 loss $23.4m). The Group has cash balances of $43.0m (30 June 2023 $74.5m),  net assets of $84.0m (30 June 2023 $105.0m) and net current assets of $27.0m (30 June 2023 $68.2m). Current loans and borrowings  are $1.5m (including lease liabilities of $0.8m) compared to 30 June 2023 $0.7m. Operating cash outflow for the year was $11.6m  (30 June 2023 $17.3m).  Management have prepared cashflow forecasts underpinning the basis of preparation as a going concern. These cashflow forecasts for  the Group are dependent on a combination of the following assumptions:  The magnesia business to continue to experience growth in volumes and gross margins in both Australia and the US and to have lower  capital expenditure investment in new plant than over the prior period;  Continued growth in revenues in Leilac associated with paid engineering services and a slowdown in the rate of growth of its  operating expenditures; and  A focus and prioritisation of externally funded projects and a reduced level of pure research and development expenditure.  Based on these forecasts and assumptions,  the directors of Calix consider that the Group will continue to fulfill all obligations as and  when they fall due for the foreseeable future and accordingly consider that the Group’s financial statements should be prepared on  a going concern basis.  c) Rounding of amounts  The Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Legislative Instrument 2016/191, relating to the ‘rounding off’ of amounts in the directors’  report. Amounts in the directors’ report have been rounded off to the nearest thousand dollars, unless otherwise stated, in accordance  with the instrument.  d) Goods and services tax  Revenues, expenses, and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST, except where the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable  from the Australian Tax Office. In these circumstances the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of  an item of the expense. Receivables and payables in the statement of financial position are shown inclusive of GST.  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL REPORT  LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS FY24 HIGHLIGHTS BUSINESS UPDATES SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT CALIX ANNUAL REPORT 2024                                                                                       50  –  –  –   ===== PAGE 53 ===== 1. Summary of material accounting policies continued  e) New or amended accounting standards and interpretations  The group has adopted all of the new or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting  Standards Board (“AASB”) that are mandatory for the current reporting period. Any new or amended Accounting Standards or  Interpretations that are not yet mandatory have not been early adopted.  f) New accounting standards and interpretations not yet mandatory or early adopted  Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have recently been issued or amended but are not yet mandatory, have not  been early adopted by the consolidated entity for the annual reporting period ended 30 June 2024 and effective from 30 June 2027.  The following new and amended accounting standards are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s consolidated  financial statements:  Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-Current and Non-Current Liabilities with Covenants (Amendments to AASB 101)  Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture (AASB 2014-10).  Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements (AASB 18), issued June 2024 and effective from 30 June 2027, may have a significant  impact on the financial statement disclosures, their effect though has not been assessed.  g) Foreign currency transactions and balances  Functional and presentation currency  The functional currency of each of the Group’s entities is measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which  that entity operates. The consolidated financial statements are presented in Australian Dollars which is the Company’s functional and the  Group’s presentation currency.  Transactions and balances  Foreign currency transactions are translated into functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of transaction.  Foreign currency monetary items are translated at the year-end exchange rate. Non-monetary items measured at historical cost continue  to be carried at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair value are reported at the  exchange rate at the date when fair values were determined.  Exchange differences arising on the translation of monetary items are recognised in the profit or loss, except where deferred in equity as a  qualifying cash flow or net investment hedge.  Group companies  The financial results and position of foreign operations whose functional currency is different from the Group’s presentation currency  are translated as follows:  assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates prevailing at that reporting date; and  income and expense are translated at average exchange rates for the year.  Exchange differences arising on translation of foreign operations are transferred directly to the Group’s foreign currency translation  reserve in the statement of financial position. These differences are also recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as other  comprehensive income. The foreign currency reserve is recognised in profit or loss when the foreign operation is disposed of.  h) Critical accounting estimates and judgments  The directors evaluate estimates and judgements incorporated into the financial report based on historical knowledge and best available  current information. Estimates assume a reasonable expectation of future events and are based on current trends and economic data,  obtained both externally and within the Group. Information on material estimates and judgements used in applying the accounting policies  can be found in the following notes:  Note  Income tax  6  Goodwill impairment test  11  Share-based payment transactions  20  i) Comparatives  Certain comparative balances have been changed to align with the current year classification. The main items adjusted were:  Interest income  Historically the Group classified 'Interest income' as 'Other income. In the current period the Group has reclassified 'Interest income separately. As a result, $1.1m was reclassified from 'Other income' to 'Interest income' in the comparative period.  Loans to directors  Historically, the Group has classified 'Receipts of repayment of loans to directors' as a financing activity in the Statement of Cash Flows.  In the current period, the Group has reclassified these to investing activities. As a result, $1.1m was reclassified in the comparative period.  Other comparative balance changes are disclosed in Notes 6, 16, 22, 28.

Revenue and other income continued  Recognition and Measurement  The Group primarily generates revenue from the sale of magnesium hydroxide liquid (MHL) to customers. Additionally, the Group sells  and rents MHL dosing units and equipment for dispersing MHL into customers’ applications. Revenue from contracts with customers is  recognised when control of the goods or services is transferred to the customer, reflecting the consideration to which the Group expects  to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  Revenue is recognised and disclosed net of trade allowances, duties, and taxes paid. The Group follows the five-step approach to revenue  recognition, which requires: (i) identifying contracts, (ii) identifying separate performance obligations, (iii) determining the transaction price,  (iv) allocating the transaction price to each performance obligation, and (v) recognising revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied.  Product Sales (MHL, Dosing Unit, and Equipment Sales)  Revenue is recognised when control of the product has passed to the customer and the product is ready for its intended use. Virtually  all product sales constitute a single performance obligation at this point of intended use.  Payment terms are typically 30 days after receipt of the goods.  Rentals  Revenue from rental activities is recognised as customers obtain the benefit of the service over time. Rental income is recognised on a  straight-line basis over the corresponding rental period. If payments are received in advance, the income is deferred to the period when  the service is delivered.  Engineering Services  The Group provides engineering services to clients in the lime, cement, and sustainable processing industries, related to the application of the  Calix Groups calcination technology to their specific requirements. The terms of individual contracts determine when the revenue is recognised.  For contracts where the engagement is for delivery of a bespoke report or technical specifications as the main performance obligation,  revenues are recognised at a point in time when the report is provided at the completion of the project or term for the deliverable as set  out in the client purchase order or contract.  For contracts where a service is being delivered over a period of time, the time and materials are recharged to the customer as they are  performed, and the associated revenue is recognised during the period of service. Payment terms depend on contract specifics and  usually range from 30 to 60 days.  Grant income  Government grants are recognised when received or when the right to receive payment is established. Government grants related to costs are  deferred and recognised in the profit or loss over the period necessary to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate.  R&D incentive income  R&D incentive income relates to eligible research expenditure incurred for current projects. The claimed amounts were reviewed externally  to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Australian Taxation Office and AusIndustry.  Other Income  Other income includes gains on disposal of items of property, plant and equipment and other receipts. The amount of income is  determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item.

Recognition and Measurement  Current tax  The income tax benefit for the year comprises current income tax benefit and deferred tax benefit. Current income tax expense charged  to the profit or loss is the tax payable on taxable income calculated using applicable income tax rates enacted, or substantially enacted,  as at the end of the reporting period together with the research and development claim submitted for the reporting period. Current tax  liabilities/assets are therefore measured at the amounts expected to be paid to/recovered from the relevant taxation authority.  Deferred tax  Deferred income tax expense reflects movements in deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability balances during the year as well as  unused tax losses. Current and deferred income tax expense/(benefit) is charged or credited directly to equity instead of the profit or loss  when the tax relates to items that are credited or charged directly to equity.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are ascertained based on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their  carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets also result where amounts have been fully expensed but future tax deductions  are available. No deferred income tax will be recognised from the initial recognition of an asset or liability, excluding a business combination,  where there is no effect on accounting or taxable profit or loss or does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the  liability is settled, based on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period. Their measurement also reflects  the manner in which management expects to recover or settle the carrying amount of the related asset or liability. Deferred tax assets  relating to temporary differences and unused tax losses are recognised only to the extent that is it probable that future taxable profit will  be available against which the benefits of the deferred tax asset can be utilised.  Where the temporary difference exists in relation to investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and joint ventures, deferred tax  assets and liabilities are not recognised where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is not  probable that the reversal will occur in the foreseeable future.  Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right of set-off exists and it is intended that net settlement or  simultaneous realisation and settlement of the respective asset and liability will occur. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where  a legally enforceable right of set-off exists, the deferred tax assets and liabilities related to income taxes levied by the same taxation  authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where it is intended that the net settlement or simultaneous  realisation and settlement of the respective asset and liability will occur in future periods in which significant amounts of deferred assets  or liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled.

They are presented as current assets unless collection is not expected for more than 12 months after  the reporting date. Trade receivables are generally due for settlement within 30 days.  Recoverability of trade receivables  Credit risk management processes  Credit risk is managed through the maintenance of procedures ensuring to the extent possible, that customers and counterparties  to transactions are of sound credit worthiness. Such monitoring is used in assessing receivables for impairments. Where the Group is  unable to ascertain a satisfactory credit risk profile in relation to a customer or counterparty, the risk may be further managed through  obtaining security by way of personal or commercial guarantees over assets of sufficient value which can be claimed against in the event  of any default. Where a debtor is more than 60 days overdue, and there is no agreed payment plan in place, the debt shall be considered  impaired and a bad debt provision shall be raised in accordance with the Group’s policy on recoverability of trade receivables, see Note 22.  Where a debtor is more than 90 days overdue, and there is no agreed payment plan in place, the debt shall be defined to be in default on  the basis that there is a low expectation of recoverability of the amount.  Recognition and measurement of expected credit losses  The Group applies the AASB 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance  for all trade receivables and contract assets. Trade receivables and contract assets have shared credit risk characteristics and, as such,  the expected loss rates for trade receivables are a reasonable approximation of loss rates for contract assets. Losses incurred in the last  3 years represent less than 1% of receivables and are immaterial. Therefore, no provision for expected credit losses has been recorded.  Other receivables are recognised at amortised cost, less any provision for expected credit losses.  Due to the short-term nature of the receivables, their carrying amount is assumed to approximate fair value. The maximum exposure to  credit risk at the end of the reporting period is the carrying amount of each class of receivables mentioned above. Refer to Note 22 for  more information on the risk management policy of the Group and credit quality of the receivables.  R&D incentive receivable  The Company was eligible, in the prior year, for an R&D grant which was receivable after the Australia Tax Office processes the Company’s  tax return. The amount of R&D grant receivable is accrued based on eligible expenses incurred during the prior financial year. The  company exceeded the $20m group turnover threshold to be eligible for the R&D incentive rebate in the current year and therefore is not  eligible for the cash rebate from the ATO.  Deposit paid  The balance of deposits paid comprise prepayment associated with supply of utilities for Bacchus Marsh; a guarantee on the office sites at  Pymble; deposits for an overseas employer of record; and a bond paid to the Department of Energy & Mining in South Australia for future  mine rehabilitation work.

Non-current assets – intangibles continued  Capitalised development costs  The capitalised development costs intangible asset relates to expenditure incurred on the development, design and construction of cement  and lime manufacturing; development, design and construction of lithium processing (see note 12); and BOOSTER-Mag technologies.  The costs were recognised on the basis that they were incurred in the development phase, in accordance with AASB 138, through the  demonstration of technical feasibility of completion, the intention to complete and use or sell the assets, as well as the clear path to  economic benefits, the availability of technical and financial resources, and reliable measurement of expenditure. The capitalised development  costs are not amortised until the associated product and service are demonstrated to be available for commercial use and an appropriate  amortisation period set. A $0.2m impairment expense was recognized in relation to capitalised development costs associated with a  refractory project that has discontinued and costs associated with the decision to move the Leilac 2 facility from Hanover to Ennigeloh.  Patent and trademarks  Patents and trademarks are recognised at cost of acquisition. Patents and trademarks have a finite life and are carried at cost less any  accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses. Amortisation is systematically allocated over the useful life of each patent and trademark.  In calculating amortisation costs, patents are taken to have a useful life of 20 years, trademarks are taken to have a useful life of 10 years.  11. Goodwill  June 2024  June 2023  $’000  $’000  Goodwill  3,638  3,638  Total goodwill  3,638  3,638  Accounting for goodwill  Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business where the fair value of the consideration exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired.  Goodwill is not amortised, instead it is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate  that it might be impaired and is carried as cost less accumulated impairment losses. The cash generating unit (CGU) to which the goodwill  relates is the US Water business.  Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount to the carrying value of the asset. For the current period, the  recoverable amount was determined based on fair value less costs of disposal calculations which required the use of assumptions. In order  to calculate the recoverable amount, cash flows associated with the US operations, which is the cash generating unit to which the goodwill  was assigned, was forecasted for the next 5 years. The current budget is the primary source of assumed values. The growth rate used in  the cash flow forecast for the terminal value was 3%, being the current years US inflation rate. The revenue forecast assumes a compound  annual growth rate of 9.22% over the 5-year forecast period. The discount rate used in the cash flow forecast was 10%, being an externally  sourced rate based on an analysis of the Group. The growth rate of 3% and the discount rate were also used to determine the terminal value.  A sensitivity analysis was performed on the key assumptions of the cash flow forecast to determine how much each of the assumptions  would have to move in order for the recoverable amount to drop below the carrying amount of the goodwill. In the case of the revenue  growth, it would need to drop to compound annual growth rate of 8.68% before an impairment would need to be recognised. In the case of  the discount factor, this would need to rise above 11.6% before an impairment would need to be recognised. Impairment losses on goodwill  are taken to the profit or loss and not subsequently reversed.  12.

Recognition and Measurement  Each class of plant and equipment is carried at cost, any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Plant and equipment are  measured on the cost basis less depreciation and impairment losses. The cost of plant and equipment constructed includes the cost of  materials, direct labour, borrowing costs and an appropriate proportion of fixed and variable overheads. Subsequent costs are included  in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits  associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measure reliably. All other repairs and maintenance  expenses are charged to the income statements during the financial period in which they are incurred.  Property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land, is depreciated or amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life  for the asset. Estimated useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed at the end of the reporting period. The depreciation rates  used for each class for depreciable assets are shown in the list below. Land is not subject to depreciation.  Office, furniture, fittings and equipment: 10%-25%  Baccus Marsh calciner and R&D facilities: 5%-25%  Slurry manufacturing and application assets: 2%-20%  LEILAC plants: 20-50%  Mining tenements: extraction rate of ore  Midstream UJV Project: work in progress – not depreciating yet  The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date. An asset’s carrying amount  is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.  Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount. These gains or losses are included in the  statement of comprehensive income.  Mining tenements and associated mineral resources  The costs of acquiring mining tenements and associated mineral resources are capitalised as part of property plant and equipment  and amortised over the estimated productive life of each applicable resource. Amortisation commences when extraction of the mineral  resource commences. The tenement is expected to be retired in 2044.  Impairment  In the year ended 30 June 2024, no assets were found to require impairment under the Group’s accounting policy (2023: $NIL).

The balance is recognised as a current liability with the amount being normally  paid within 30 days of recognition of the liability.  The carrying amounts of the Group’s trade and other payables are denominated in Australian dollars. Due to the short-term nature of  the payables, their carrying amount is assumed to approximate fair value. For an analysis of the financial risks associated with trade and  other payables refer to Note 22.  14.

Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised  cost. Any difference between the proceeds and the redemption amount is recognised as profit or loss over the period of the borrowings  using the effective interest rate method.  Where there is an unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date, the loans or  borrowings are classified as non-current.

The right-of-use asset is measured at cost, which comprises the  initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for, as applicable, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date net of any  lease incentives received, any initial direct costs incurred, and an estimate of costs expected to be incurred for dismantling and removing  the underlying asset, and restoring the site or asset. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the unexpired period  of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset, whichever is the shorter. Where the Group expects to obtain ownership of the leased  asset at the end of the lease term, the depreciation is over its estimated useful life. Right-of use assets are subject to impairment or  adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.  The Group has elected not to recognise a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability for short-term leases with terms of 12  months or less and leases of assets whose fair value is less than $10,000. Lease payments on these assets are expensed to profit or loss  as incurred.  Lease liabilities  A lease liability is recognised at the commencement date of a lease. The lease liability is initially recognised at the present value  of the lease payments to be made over the term of the lease, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate  cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments comprise of fixed payments less any lease  incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, amounts expected to be paid under residual value  guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option when the exercise of the option is reasonably certain to occur, and any anticipated  termination penalties.  The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Lease  liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The carrying amounts are remeasured if there is a change  in the following: future lease payments arising from a change in an index, or a rate used; residual guarantee; lease term; certainty of a  purchase option and termination penalties. When a lease liability is remeasured, an adjustment is made to the corresponding right-of use  asset, or to profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is fully written down.

Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation  at the reporting date. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future  cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific  to the liability. The increase in the provision resulting from the passage of time is recognised in finance costs.  Employee benefits  Provision is made for the Group’s liability for employee benefits arising from services rendered by employees to balance date. Employee  benefits that are expected to be settled within one year have been measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liability is  settled, plus related on-costs.  Employee benefits payable later than one year have been measured at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made  for those benefits. In determining the liability, consideration is given to employee wage increases and the probability that the employee  may satisfy vesting requirements. Those cash flows are discounted using market yields on high quality corporate bonds with terms to  maturity that match the expected timing of cash outflows.  Rehabilitation provision  The Group recognises a mine rehabilitation provision on the basis that it has an obligation to restore the site of the mine in Myrtle Springs  to its original condition and the cost to do so is uncertain. The measurement of the provision is the present value of the best estimate of  the expenditure required to settle the obligation as at the end of the reporting period. It should also be noted that a bond of $274,000  was lodged on 9 October 2014 with the South Australia Department of State Development to be applied to rehabilitation of the area at  cessation of mining activity, on the basis of a Program for Environmental Protection and Rehabilitation (PEPR) which was approved by the  South Australia Department of State Development. This bond appears in Note 8 under deposits paid.

Issued capital continued  Ordinary Shares  Ordinary shares entitle the holder to participate in dividends and the proceeds on winding up of the Company in proportion to the number  of and amounts paid on the shares held. On a show of hands, every holder of ordinary shares present at a meeting in person or by proxy, is  entitled to one vote, and upon a poll each share is entitled to one vote. Ordinary shares have no par value and the Company does not have  a limited amount of authorised capital.  Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Any transaction costs arising on the issue of ordinary shares are recognised directly in equity as a  reduction of the share proceeds received.  ESS withdrawals  Employee Share Scheme (“ESS”) withdrawals are facilitated by transferring pre-allocated shares from the ESS trust to ordinary capital. In  this way, the share-based payment reserve is reversed for the amount of the shares and the shares are transferred to the recipient. During  the year ended 30 June 2024, $nil in shares were issued from the ESS trust (2023: $nil).  EIS withdrawals  Calix Officers & Employee Incentive Scheme (EIS) withdrawals are vested rights that have been exercised by the employee into ordinary  capital.

The cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss when the net  investment is disposed of.  Share-based payment reserve  The share-based payment reserve is used to recognise shares and rights earned by employees and officers as part of the ESS plan and  the EIS. Shares issued through the ESS are valued at the grant date fair value of shares issued and vested to employees and directors.  These reserves are reversed against share capital held by ESS plan when the shares vest. The rights which are as part of the EIS are  valued using options valuation models which take into account vesting criteria, market price and the exercise windows. See Note 20 for  more information on share-based payments.

Share based payments  Calix Officers & Employees Incentive Scheme  On 18 April 2018, at an extraordinary general meeting, the shareholders of Calix approved an EIS to operate once the Company was listed.  The Calix Officers & Employees Incentive Scheme (“EIS”) provides for the grant of rights and/or options to eligible officers and employees  (as determined by the Board) and is intended to provide competitive, performance-based remuneration supporting retention, incentive  and reward, and alignment with shareholders. Non-executive and independent directors are not invited to participate in the EIS.  Overview of the EIS  The first round of the EIS was made available to all Calix employees, including KMP (but excluding non-executive directors), at the end of  2018 with an ability to earn parcels of options over the proceeding five-year period to 30 June 2024. The scheme was extended in 2022  with an additional round made available with the ability to earn parcels of options over the proceeding five-year. The Board has determined  that the current EIS scheme will be replaced in FY25 with a more traditional short-term and long-term incentive performance rights plan.  The Board typically limits the number of shares over which options will be issued under the EIS to 2% of the total number of shares on  issue (i.e. undiluted) in any one year. Subject to any limitations that might apply under the Corporations Act 2001 or limits under ASIC class  order relief, there is no limit on the number of options that may be issued under the EIS. The actual percentage of options on issue will  fluctuate as a result of changes in staffing levels.  Performance Gateways  Three Performance Gateways are used to determine performance-vesting in each year and are applied sequentially:  Gateway 1 – SHEQ performance  Gateway 1 is achieving the Company’s Safety, Health, Environment, and Quality Action Plan KPIs as agreed with the Board each year. If  the Safety Health, Environment, and Quality Action Plan KPIs are not met, then options can be awarded for performance that year. This  Performance Gateway is designed to ensure that Safety, Health and Environmental performance of our team members and Quality of  our products and services remain paramount at all times. The Action Plan reflects International Standard ISO45001, against which the  Company is audited annually.  Gateway 2 – Share price performance  Gateway 2 assesses absolute share price performance over the year as measured by Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”), as described  below. TSR is measured as Calix’s share price performance, being the 30-day Volume-Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”) over the 15 days  preceding, and the 15 days after, June 30 in the prior financial year (“Baseline TSR”) as compared with the 30-day VWAP over the 15 days  preceding and the 15 days after 30 June in the current financial year (“Measured TSR”). If the Measured TSR for a particular financial year is  not higher than the Baseline TSR for that period of measurement, any options earned under Performance Gateway 3 (as described below)  remain unvested. However, such unvested options may vest if at any time before the end of the financial year immediately after each  testing period, the 30-day VWAP for Calix’s shares exceeds the applicable Baseline TSR for those unvested options.  Gateway 3 – Performance against KPIs  Gateway 3 measures company and executive performance against KPIs agreed each year with the Board. These KPIs reflect the corporate  milestone targets set for each line of business, and are communicated to the market at regular times during the year via the Companys  market updates and the scheduled lodgment of its financial reports. Gateway 3 helps to drive achievement of annual performance metrics  that balance both short-term and long-term shareholder value creation.  The EIS options that have passed through all three gateways will be classed as “performance-vested”. These options will then be subject  to tenure-based vesting with one third vesting immediately. The other two thirds will then vest in two equal traches at the end of each  of the two full financial years following the performance year, provided the KMP or senior executive remains a full-time employee of  the Company.  During the years ended 30 June 2024, the Group recognised a share based payment expense related to the number of options vesting and  to be vested in connection with the fulfilment of the vesting conditions related to these financial periods as well as the forecasted value  of those options at their expected exercise date.

Diluted EPS is not  presented as potential ordinary shares shall be treated as dilutive, only when their conversion to ordinary shares would decrease EPS or increase the loss per share.  22. Financial risk management  The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk (including foreign currency risk and interest rate risk),  credit risk and liquidity risk. The Groups Treasury function is responsible for managing the liquidity requirements of the Group and  mitigating these financial risks through continuous monitoring and evaluation.  The Group adheres to a set of policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on liquidity risk, foreign  exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and the use of derivative financial instruments, as required, for hedging purposes. The Group  does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes. There have been no  changes to the Group’s exposure to financial risks or the manner in which it manages and measures these risks from the prior year.  The Group holds the following financial instruments, all of which are measured at amortised cost:  June 2024  June 2023  $’000  $’000  Financial assets  Cash and cash equivalents  42,958  74,466  Current trade and other receivables  3,921  1,839  Non-current trade and other receivables  301  293  Total financial assets  47,180  76,598  Financial liabilities  Trade and other payables  5,422  3,432  Current borrowings  760  318  Current lease liabilities  783  355  Non-current borrowings  7  Non-current lease liabilities  1,715  637  Total financial liabilities  8,680  4,749  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL REPORT  67  DIRECTORS' REPORT GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT OTHER FY25 PRIORITIES                                                                                                                                                                                                                 FINANCIAL REPORT  —  —  ’  —   ===== PAGE 70 ===== 22. Financial risk management continued  a) Credit risk  Exposure to credit risk relating to financial assets arises from the potential non-performance by counterparties of contract obligations  that could lead to a financial loss to the Group.  Credit risk is managed through the maintenance of procedures ensuring to the extent possible, that customers and counterparties to  transactions are of sound credit worthiness. Such monitoring is used in assessing receivables for impairments. Risk is also minimised  through investing surplus funds in financial institutions that maintain a high credit rating, or in entities that the Audit and Risk  Management Committee (“ARMC”) has otherwise cleared as being financially sound.  Where the Group is unable to ascertain a satisfactory credit risk profile in relation to a customer or counterparty, the risk may be further  managed through obtaining security by way of personal or commercial guarantees over assets of sufficient value which can be claimed  against in the event of any default.  Credit risk exposure  The maximum exposure to credit risk by class of recognised financial assets at balance date, excluding the value of any collateral or other  security held, is equivalent to the carrying value of the trade and other receivables (net of any provisions).  There is no significant concentration of credit risk with any single counter party or group of counter parties.  Past due but not impaired  As at 30 June 2024, trade receivables of $20,466 were past due but not impaired (2023: $28,958). These relate to a number of  independent customers for whom there is not recent history of default.  The aging analysis of trade receivables is as below:  June 2024  June 2023  $’000  $’000  Current  2,346  1,443  Less than 30 days  351  55  Less than 60 days  19  More than 60 days  20  25  Total trade receivables  2,736  1,523  The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets and are not past due. Based on the credit history of  these other classes, it is expected that these amounts will be received when due. The Group does not hold any collateral in relation to  theses receivables.  b) Liquidity risk  Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that the Group might encounter difficulty in settling its debts or otherwise meetings its obligations  related to financial liabilities.  Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents and the availability of funding through  adequate amount of credit facilities to meet obligations when due.  Management monitors the Groups liquidity levels (comprising undrawn borrowing facilities (Note 14) and cash and cash equivalents  (Note 7) on the basis of expected cash flows.  The following table details the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial assets and liabilities. The table has  been drawn up based on the cash flows expected to continue to be received/paid by the Group.

Refer to Note 1 (i).  c) Interest rate risk  Exposure to interest rate risk relates to cash and cash equivalents and borrowings, details of which are set out in Notes 7 and 14.  Profit or loss is sensitive to higher/lower interest income from cash and cash equivalents and interest expenses on borrowings as a result  of changes in interest rates. The following analysis shows the impact on post tax profit as a result of a movement in interest income and  expense from variable interest rate deposit and borrowing facilities.

With instruments being held by overseas entities, fluctuations in US Dollars (USD), UK Pound Sterling (GBP) and  Euro (EUR) may impact on the Group’s financial results unless those exposures are appropriately hedged.

Consolidation accounting policies  Business combinations occur where an acquirer obtains control over one or more businesses and results in the consolidation of assets  and liabilities. A business combination is accounted for by applying the acquisition method, unless it is a combination involving entities  or businesses under common control. The acquisition method requires that for each business combination one of the combining entities  must be identified as the acquirer (i.e. parent entity).  The business combination will be accounted for as at the acquisition date, which is the date that control over the acquiree is obtained by  the parent entity. At this date, the parent shall recognise, in the consolidated accounts, and subject to certain limited exceptions, the fair  value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In addition, contingent liabilities of the acquiree will be recognised where  a present obligation has been incurred and its fair value can be reliably measured.  The acquisition may result in the recognition of goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase. The method adopted for the measurement of  goodwill will impact on the measurement of any non-controlling interest to be recognised in the acquiree where less than 100% ownership  interest is held in the acquiree.  The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred for a business combination plus the acquisition date fair value of any  previously held equity interest shall form the cost of the investment in the separate financial statements.  Consideration may comprise the sum of the assets transferred by the acquirer, liabilities incurred by the acquirer to the former owners  of the acquiree and the equity interest issued by the acquirer. Included in the measurement of consideration transferred is any asset or  liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Any obligation incurred relating to contingent consideration is classified  as either a financial liability or equity instrument, depending upon the nature of the arrangement. All transaction costs incurred in relation  to the business combination are expensed to the consolidated income statement.

Joint arrangements  The Company holds a 45% interest in the “Midstream UJV”. The unincorporated joint venture agreement requires a supermajority vote,  being 75% of the total participating interest, for all major joint arrangement decisions. These include setting budgets, work programs,  manager or auditor appointment and other significant actions. The two joint venturers own the assets of the partnership as tenants  in common and are jointly and severally liable for the liabilities incurred by the partnership. The entity is therefore classified as a joint  operation and the consolidated entity recognises its share of all jointly held assets and liabilities, and their associated revenues and  expenses. The $12.2m gain on contribution to the Midstream UJV (2023: $NIL) represents the difference between Calix individual $7.7m  contribution to the UJV and Calix $19.9m overall 45% proportionally consolidated share of the UJV.

Parent Company Investment in Subsidiary Companies  Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost in the individual financial statements of Calix Limited. An impairment loss is recognised  whenever the carrying amount of the investment exceeds its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is the higher of value in use and fair  value less costs of disposal. The carrying value of the parent’s investment in subsidiaries as at 30 June 2024 was $12.2m (2023: $12.2m).  27.

After balance date events  On 23 July 2024, Calix announced it had been awarded a $15 million grant from the Australian Government’s Carbon Capture Technologies  Program. The grant will support the construction of a world-first renewably powered carbon capture and use demonstration plant in  South Australia to produce near zero emissions lime and supply captured industrial CO2 emissions to the HyGATE funded Solar Methanol 1  project (“SM1”). Further information is available on Calix’s website in its investor centre and the ASX market announcements platform.  No other matters or circumstances have arisen since the end of the year which significantly affected, or may significantly affect, the  operations of the Group, the results of those operations, or the state of affairs of the Group in future years.

Determination of Tax Residency  Section 295 (3A) of the Corporations Acts 2001 requires that the tax residency of each entity which is included in the Consolidated Entity  Disclosure Statement (CEDS) be disclosed. In the context of an entity which was an Australian resident, “Australian resident” has the  meaning provided in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. The determination of tax residency involves judgment as the determination of  tax residency is highly fact dependent and there are currently several different interpretations that could be adopted, and which could  give rise to a different conclusion on residency.

In our opinion, the accompanying Financial  Report of the Company gives a true and  fair view, including of the Group’s  financial position as at 30 June 2024 and  of its financial performance for the year  then ended, in accordance with the  Corporations Act 2001, in compliance with  Australian Accounting Standards and the  Corporations Regulations 2001.  The Financial Report comprises:     • Consolidated statement of financial position as at 30  June 2024  • Consolidated statement of profit or loss and other  comprehensive income, Consolidated statement of  changes in equity, and Consolidated statement of  cash flows for the year then ended  • Notes, including material accounting policies  • Consolidated entity disclosure statement and  accompanying basis of preparation as at 30 June  2024  • Directors’ Declaration.  The Group consists of the Company and the entities it  controlled at the year end or from time to time during  the financial year.    Basis for opinion  We conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. We believe that the audit  evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.  Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for  the audit of the Financial Report section of our report.   We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical  requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board’s APES 110 Code of Ethics  for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) that are relevant to our  audit of the Financial Report in Australia.

These matters were addressed in the context of  our audit of the Financial Report as a whole, and  in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not  provide a separate opinion on these matters.    Going Concern   Refer to Note 1b to the Financial Report  The key audit matter  How the matter was addressed in our audit  The Group’s use of the going concern basis of  accounting and the associated extent of  uncertainty is a key audit matter due to the high  level of judgement required by us in evaluating  the Group’s assessment of going concern and  the events or conditions that may cast  significant doubt on their ability to continue as a  going concern. These are outlined in Note 1b.    The Directors have determined that the use of  the going concern basis of accounting is  appropriate in preparing the financial report.   Their assessment of going concern was based  on cash flow projections. The preparation of  these projections incorporated a number of  assumptions and significant judgements, and  the  Directors have concluded that the range of  possible outcomes considered in arriving at this  judgement does not give rise to a material  uncertainty casting significant doubt on the  Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.   We critically assessed the levels of uncertainty,  as it related to the Group’s ability to continue as  a going concern, within these assumptions and  judgements, focusing on the following:  •  The Group’s significant cash inflow  assumptions particularly, revenue growth  and gross margin;  •  The Group’s planned levels of operational  and capital expenditures, and the ability of  the Group to manage cash outflows within  Our procedures included:  • We analysed the cash flow projections by:  •  Evaluating the underlying data used to  generate the projections.  We specifically  looked for their consistency with the  Group’s intentions, as outlined in  Directors minutes and strategy  documents, and their comparability to  past practices.  •  Analysing the impact of reasonably  possible changes in projected cash flows  and their timing, to the projected periodic  cash positions.  Assessing the resultant  impact to the ability of the Group to pay  debts as and when they fall due and  continue as a going concern.  The specific  areas we focused on were informed from  our test results of the accuracy of  previous Group cash flow projections and  sensitivity analysis on key cash flow  projection assumptions.   •  Assessing the Group’s significant cash  inflow assumptions and judgements for  feasibility and timing.  We used our  knowledge of the Group, its industry, and  customers trends and conditions to  assess the level of associated uncertainty.  •  Assessing the planned levels of operating  and capital expenditures for consistency  of relationships and trends to the Group’s  LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS FY24 HIGHLIGHTS BUSINESS UPDATES SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT CALIX ANNUAL REPORT 2024   76   ===== PAGE 79 ===== INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT  77  available funding; and  • The Group’s plans to reduce level of planned research and development expenditure to address going concern. This included the feasibility, projected timing, quantum of potential savings and status of the proposed plans. In assessing this key audit matter, we involved  senior audit team members who understand  the Group’s business, industry, and the  economic environment it operates in.  historical results ,our understanding of the  business, industry and economic  conditions of the Group.  • We assessed significant non-routine forecast cash inflows and outflows, including the impact of reducing the level of planned research and development expenditure for feasibility, quantum and timing, and their impact to going concern. We used our knowledge of the Group, its industry and status to assess the level of associated uncertainty. • We read Directors minutes and relevant correspondence with the Group’s advisors to understand and the Group’s ability to access additional shareholder funds. • We evaluated the Group’s going concern disclosures in the financial report by comparing them to our understanding of the matter, the events or conditions incorporated into the cash flow projection assessment, the Group’s plans to address those events or conditions, and accounting standard requirements. Share Based Payments ($5,125,000)  Refer to Note 20 to the Financial Report  The key audit matter  How the matter was addressed in our audit  Valuation of share based payments is a key  audit matter due to the size of the balance  relative to the Group's results (being 19.5% of  loss before tax) and the significant effort  required by us to audit the Group’s Employee  Incentive Scheme plan.  The most significant areas of judgement we  focused on was assessing the Group’s:    • Valuation methodology and inputs used by the Group’s external expert in the Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model, such as the grant date, share price at grant date, risk-free interest rate and volatility rate for share options containing market conditions; Our procedures included:  • We considered the appropriateness of the Group's accounting for share based  payment arrangements against the  requirements of the accounting standards. • Read underlying documentation to obtain an  understanding of the contractual nature and  terms and conditions of the share based  payment arrangements. • Tested the inputs used by the Group’s  external expert in the Monte Carlo simulation  option pricing model, such as vesting period,  grant date, share price at grant date and  number of options issued to underlying offer  letters and contracts. • Checked the share price at grant date to the 77  DIRECTORS' REPORT GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT OTHER FY25 PRIORITIES   FINANCIAL REPORT   ===== PAGE 80 ===== INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT              78    •  The probability of achieving the market  conditions that is factored into the grant  date fair value; and   •  The estimated achievement date of  meeting performance against Key  Performance Indicator’s (Gateway 3) and  service conditions for non-market  conditions.    We involved valuation specialists to supplement  our senior audit team members in assessing  this key audit matter.  issue price of the Group’s shares on the  Group’s quotation on the ASX.   •  Worked with our valuation specialist to:   •  use our knowledge of the Group and our  industry experience, and develop an  independent expected volatility  assumption from publicly available  market data of comparable entities.  We  compared this to the expected volatility  assumption used by the Group.  •  independently assess and calculate the  fair value of the options at grant date  using a  Monte Carlo simulation option  pricing model for the options that  contain market conditions, with the  publicly available risk-free interest rate,  and the share price and expected  volatility rate from the procedures noted  above. We compared our valuation of  the share options to the fair value  determined by the Group.  •  Recalculated the share based payment  expense over the vesting periods based on the  independently determined fair value as  outlined from the procedures noted above.   We compared this to the share based  payment expense recorded by the Group.  •  Assessed the scope, competence and  objectivity of the external expert engaged by  the Group to assist with the valuation of the  employee incentive scheme options that  contained market conditions granted during  the year.  •  Assessed the probabilities determined by the  Group in achieving market conditions by  retrospectively assessing the share price at  testing date.  •  Assessed the achievement of non-market  vesting conditions against those estimated by  the Group at grant date.     •  Assessed the appropriateness of disclosures  against the requirements of the accounting  standards.

The Directors are responsible for  the Other Information.   Our opinion on the Financial Report does not cover the Other Information and, accordingly, we do not  express an audit opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon, with the exception of the  Remuneration Report and our related assurance opinion.  In connection with our audit of the Financial Report, our responsibility is to read the Other  Information. In doing so, we consider whether the Other Information is materially inconsistent with  the Financial Report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially  misstated.  We are required to report if we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this Other  Information, and based on the work we have performed on the Other Information that we obtained  prior to the date of this Auditor’s Report we have nothing to report.    Responsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Report  The Directors are responsible for:  • preparing the Financial Report in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, including giving  a true and fair view of the financial position and performance of the Group, and in compliance  with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001  • implementing necessary internal control to enable the preparation of a Financial Report in  accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, including giving a true and fair view of the  financial position and performance of the Group, and that is free from material misstatement,  whether due to fraud or error  • assessing the Group and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern and whether the  use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate. This includes disclosing, as  applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting  unless they either intend to liquidate the Group and Company or to cease operations, or have  no realistic alternative but to do so.     Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Report  Our objective is:  • to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Report as a whole is free from  material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and   • to issue an Auditor’s Report that includes our opinion.   Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in  accordance with Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it  exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in the  aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on  the basis of the Financial Report.  79  DIRECTORS' REPORT GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT OTHER FY25 PRIORITIES   FINANCIAL REPORT   ===== PAGE 82 ===== INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT  LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS FY24 HIGHLIGHTS BUSINESS UPDATES SUSTAINABILITY ABOUT CALIX ANNUAL REPORT 2024   80   ===== PAGE 83 ===== Additional information required by Australian Securities Exchange Listing Rules and not disclosed elsewhere in this report.

Our vision is for Calix to be a leading global innovator of industrial  solutions for the environment.  We are urgently applying our technology to address some of  humanity's greatest challenges in decarbonisation and sustainability.  Sustainability is core to our purpose, and as such, Calix is deeply  committed to furthering our own environmental and social efforts.  Over the past year, Calix has made progress against our  sustainability objectives as we continue to accelerate our impact.  In FY24, we built on our previous greenhouse gas assessment by  strengthening our data collection to complete a more robust and  accurate assessment of our footprint. This has provided improved  insight into where emission hotspots exist within our operations,  enabling us to better target our efforts to minimise emissions.  We also continued to innovate through our technology, making  significant inroads towards providing viable pathways for efficient  processing of low-carbon energy-intensive mineral products and the  capture of unavoidable process emissions across multiple industries.  Our people are vital to our success. Their health and safety is  paramount, and we are continuously improving and identifying  new ways to further support our employees. I am pleased that in  FY24 Calix had no significant injuries, demonstrating our strong  safety culture and performance. We are focused on supporting  the wellbeing of our people, and in the past six months held  psychosocial workshops to gain a deeper understanding of the ways  we can increase support for their mental health. These initiatives  reflect the broader culture we’re building at Calix. I would like to  thank every member of our team for their contribution to creating a  safer, and more inclusive, innovative and sustainable company.  At Calix, we aim to benefit the communities in which we live and  work. In FY24, we continued to partner with organisations enabling  clean water access and reaffirmed our commitment to the United  Nations Global Compact, upholding our commitment to engage in  practices consistent with our values and principles.  The Calix Board of Directors (the Board) maintains a proactive  and careful process of board renewal to ensure the appropriate  composition to support the delivery of Calix’s strategic goals. The  ongoing renewal has resulted in the Board being comprised of seven  directors, including five independent non-executive directors, who  together bring a strong mix of skills, experience, knowledge and  diversity, including gender diversity.  As we near 20 years since our founding as a company in 2005, the  applications and potential impact of our core platform technology  continue to advance. Our technology and purpose-driven approach  will play an increasingly important role as governments, investors,  and customers demand cost-effective and environmentally sound  solutions for the materials of our future economy.  The sustainability outcomes delivered by our technology and,  increasingly our operations, present an opportunity for shared  value creation and better environmental outcomes for all. We are  pleased to share our progress against our internal sustainability  ambitions from the past twelve months. Calix remains steadfast  in our commitment to accelerating action against climate change,  fostering diversity and inclusion, and embedding more sustainable  and responsible business practices throughout our organisation.  Because there is only one Earth.  Phil Hodgson  Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer  03  Introduction — Message from our CEO   ===== PAGE 6 ===== Calix exists to solve global environmental challenges.  In the same spirit, the Company is stepping up its own efforts to  further embed sustainability into its strategic decision-making  in compliance with reporting standards. As Chair of the Board’s  Sustainability Committee, I have the distinct pleasure of working with  fellow members, Calix’s leadership and the broader team to advance  Calix in its own sustainability journey.  In the past year, we have seen the global movement towards  alignment of sustainability reporting standards strengthen.  Sparked by the release of the International Financial Reporting  Standards (IFRS) S1 and S2, Calix is working to enhance our  sustainability strategy, governance, and risk management in line  with the Australian Accounting Standards Board’s (AASB) proposed  Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards (ASRS).  The Company has taken early steps to ensure key elements of the  ASRS are provided in this year’s Sustainability Report. This includes  key metrics such as Calix’s greenhouse gas footprint, covering all  three segmented scopes. The Company is laying the groundwork  for full compliance ahead of the Group 3 FY28 reporting deadline  recommended by the Australian Government’s Treasury.  To this end, Calix commenced an ASRS gap analysis to identify areas  where the Company could improve by incorporating climate and  other material sustainability-related risks and opportunities in its  assessments and governance processes. Further, Calix is currently  evaluating the necessary technology and tools to independently  assure its climate-related disclosures. The culmination of this  work will enable Calix to consider the most impactful topics  to its long-term resilience – informed by science, data and  stakeholder feedback.  We look forward to keeping you informed of our progress towards  our sustainability ambitions.  Helen Fisher  Non-Executive Director and Chair, Sustainability Committee  MESSAGE FROM SUSTAINABILITY  COMMITTEE CHAIR  Calix is stepping up its  own efforts to further  embed sustainability across  company practices.  04  COMMUNITY  SUSTAINABILITY AMBITIONS  APPENDIX  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2024  RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS  INTRODUCTION   ===== PAGE 7 ===== CLIMATE  STATEMENT  Calix recognises the impact climate change will have  on our business, operations and value proposition,  including potential opportunities and risks.  For more information about Calix’s:  – Sustainability strategy and targets, please see ‘Our sustainability ambitions’  – Governance and risk management, please see ‘Responsible business' and our FY24 Corporate Governance Statement  Calix is committed to high standards of corporate governance and transparency.  The Board, with support from the Sustainability Committee, oversees the Company’s  sustainability strategies, policies and initiatives. In tandem, the Audit and Risk  Management, People, Culture and Nominations, and Technology Committees play  an important role in assisting the Board to fulfil its other corporate governance and  oversight responsibilities, including climate and regulatory-related risk management  systems, and embedding Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations  across the Company. Within Calix, we have a dedicated resource to manage our ESG  activities, as well as a group of volunteers from across regions, functions and business  lines drive the implementation of our internal sustainability initiatives (Volunteer  Sustainability Team).  Calix is on a mission to help solve some of the greatest global environmental challenges  of our time, including through the decarbonisation of cement, steel and alumina,  sustainable processing of critical minerals, direct air capture of atmospheric carbon  dioxide (CO2), and sustainable environmental products. Accelerating a just transition to  a carbon-neutral world is both a business and operational priority.  In FY24, Calix completed a more comprehensive greenhouse gas (GHG) assessment,  providing a detailed footprint of the Company’s FY23 emissions. As a result, Calix is  able to report Scope 3 emissions – a key milestone in our commitment to reduce the  Company’s emissions in line with the 1.5 °C degree pathway. The assessment identified  the hotspots in our operations and supply chain, which will inform our emissions  reduction roadmap and activities.  Ahead of the reporting deadline recommended by the Australian Government’s Treasury,  Calix will conduct a materiality assessment and climate scenario analysis to help inform  our strategic areas of focus and feed into our investment decisions and planning. We  expect these exercises will provide the Company with additional, robust insights into  the relevant material climate-related risks and opportunities over the short, medium  and long term, pursuant to the proposed ASRS. We will share the outcomes of these  exercises in forthcoming reports.

Because Mars is for quitters.  06  COMMUNITY  SUSTAINABILITY AMBITIONS  APPENDIX  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2024  RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS  INTRODUCTION   ===== PAGE 9 ===== Our foundations  In 2005, Calix's founders Connor Horley and Mark Sceats first  embarked on the development of a revolutionary idea for a new  type of kiln. It quickly became apparent the technology had the  potential to be applied across a multitude of industries to help solve  some of the world’s greatest challenges. Through a combination of  rigorous research and development, targeted investment decisions  and funding, and the ingenuity and passion of a dedicated team, the  potential of the Company’s core platform technology is beginning to  be realised. From a single application in wastewater treatment, Calix  now has 28 patent families covering its core platform technology  and applications across a range of industrial decarbonisation,  mineral processing and environmental solutions.  As an environmental technology company, we aim to embed  sustainability considerations into our decision-making. Participating  in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) – the world’s largest  corporate sustainability initiative driving action to support the  achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – means  aligning our practices with the Ten Principles of the UNGC and  working towards the SDGs.  Alignment with the United Nations Global Compact  The SDGs are at the heart of the United Nation’s 2030 Agenda  for Sustainable Development, a shared blueprint for peace and  prosperity for people and the planet, now and into the future.  Seventeen integrated goals represent a call to action in critically  important areas for humanity and the planet, such as ending  poverty, improving health and education, reducing inequality, and  preserving nature. Positively impacting one area will benefit another,  spurring further progress needed within the window of opportunity  to prevent the worst impacts of the climate crisis and secure  climate justice.  To reach the SDGs, industries must have a sustainable and  economical pathway towards carbon neutrality and effective  management of our land and water. Just like the UNGC, Calix  recognises the need to balance social, economic and environmental  sustainability. Across the applications of the Company’s core  platform technology, we are providing solutions aligned with  ten SDGs.  Calix’s operations are grounded in the UNGC’s Ten Principles. These  Ten Principles outline the foundation of a principles-based approach  to conducting business: upholding basic responsibilities to people  and the planet while setting the stage for long-term success. By  implementing the Ten Principles, companies avoid undermining the  achievements of the SDGs and contribute to their realisation.  As a signatory of the UNGC, Calix is committed to making the Ten  Principles part of our strategy, culture and operations and taking  action in support of the SDGs. Calix supports and respects the  rights of all humans, upholds ethical and fair labour practices,  aims to operate in an environmentally responsible manner and is  committed to conducting our business and related activities with the  utmost integrity. Calix has been a proud member of the UNGC since  2020 and has recommitted annually through our Communication on  Progress, including in 2024.  29  PATENT FAMILIES  COVERING CORE  TECHNOLOGY &  APPLICATIONS  10  UNGC PRINCIPLES  EMBEDDED  IN CALIX'S  OPERATIONS  07  Introduction — Our purpose-led approach   ===== PAGE 10 ===== CREATING VALUE  AND IMPACT  Our technology  Every application of Calix's core platform technology is designed to address a specific global challenge consistent with our purpose, values,  and company ethos, present opportunities for shared value creation and economic growth, and deliver sustainable competitive advantage.  Calix is applying its core platform technology to:  – The decarbonisation of cement, iron and steel, and alumina;  – Sustainable processing of critical minerals;  – Direct air capture of atmospheric CO2; and  – Sustainable environmental products for water and agriculture.  As government regulations, climate commitments, and investor pressure create demand for net zero solutions, Calix is developing affordable  and scalable solutions that balance social, economic and environmental sustainability.  08  COMMUNITY  SUSTAINABILITY AMBITIONS  APPENDIX  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2024  RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS  C O  R  E  P  L  A  T  F  O  R  M  T E C H N O  L  O  G  Y  en vi ro n m e nt al pr o d uc ts  mi n er al  pr o ce ss in g  El ec tr ifi ca ti on of  Su st ai na bl e  Ca pt ur e  of  u na vo id a bl e  e mi ss io ns  Sense of urgency  Positive impact  Innovation  Resolute  Inclusive  Teamwork  MARS  IS FOR  QUITTERS  Net -ze ro c om  mit men ts  |  Dec arb onis atio n le gisl atio n, p olic y & fun ding  |  Pub lic dem and s  RAW  MATERIALS  RENEWABLE  ENERGY  PEOPLE  & IP  FINANCIAL  PARTNERSHIPS  GLOBAL LICENCE  AGREEMENTS  CREATING VALUE FOR  Planet  Targeting local & global environmental  benefits including:  – Climate change mitigation  – Sustainable mineral production  – Effective water & wastewater  treatment  – Non-toxic crop protection  – Prevention of antimicrobial  resistance  – Sustainable development  Partners  Developing cost-effective low-carbon  mineral processing for:  – Cement & lime  – Iron & steel  – Critical minerals  – Alumina  – Direct Air Capture  – Water  – Agriculture  People  Communities  Helping balance economic, social &  environmental sustainability in support  of a just transition to net zero  Shareholders  Targeting shareholder returns through  delivery to large addressable markets  Our people  Enabling impactful work & personal  development in a diverse &  equitable environment  REDUCED TOXINS  & POLLUTANTS  REDUCED  WASTE  ENERGY EFFICIENT  OPERATIONS  SAFE & SUSTAINABLE  PRODUCTS  VALUE-ADDED  MINERAL PRODUCTS  GREENHOUSE GAS  EMISSIONS  CAPTURED & AVOIDED  INTRODUCTION  HOW WE CREATE VALUE   ===== PAGE 11 ===== Renewable  energy-ready  Unavoidable CO2  emissions captured  Calciner tube  Radiative heat  transferred to raw  material  Externally heated  Pre-ground  minerals  Particle gas  separation  Low-carbon / value- added materials  Our reach  Calix’s strong global partnerships and collaborations with industry,  academia and governments are helping to enable the rapid development  and commercialisation of Calix’s core platform technology.

Ground minerals float down through externally heated tubes where they  are quickly heated by heat radiated from the tube walls. The indirect  heating process enables clean, efficient and precise electric heating to  replace inefficient combustion and carbon-intensive fossil fuels.  By separating what we heat from how we’re heating it, any carbon  dioxide released directly from the raw material, which is unavoidable  in the making of cement and lime, is kept pure and can be efficiently  captured for use or storage.  For green iron and steel, hydrogen is used to remove oxygen from the  mineral. Hydrogen, however, is not combusted or used as a fuel, and is  easily recycled. This unique feature of the technology aims to enable the  lowest-cost solution for the production of green iron and steel.  Calix’s flash calcination technology can also create high surface area  materials with enhanced chemical and/or bioactivity.  09  Introduction — Creating value and impact   ===== PAGE 12 ===== 2024 ACHIEVEMENTS  WHAT'S NEXT  Science-based emission  reduction in line with the  1.5 °C pathway.  – We built on our previous  greenhouse gas emissions  assessment by strengthening  our data collection to  complete a more robust and  accurate footprint.  – We launched our first Diversity,  Equality and Inclusion (DE&I) series,  facilitating conversations with Calix  and Leilac team members on how to  further representation and equality in  our workplace and our world.  – Achieved gender balance at the  Board level following the Board  renewal process.  – Taking learnings from the  past two assessments, Calix  will complete a full baseline  in the coming year. The FY24  greenhouse gas footprint will  serve as the starting point  for our future progress.  – Calix will develop a reduction  roadmap and begin  addressing some of the  largest sources of emissions  within our operations and  supply chain.  – Following positive feedback from Calix  employees and external stakeholders  on the valuable insights shared  during our DE&I panels, the series  will continue to explore DE&I themes  related to our Company.  – In FY25, Calix will conduct a  remuneration assessment to identify  any internal sources of financial  inequity. The analysis will follow the  implementation of a Human Resource  Management system in early 2025.  – Recognising the sustainability and  commercial benefits that come from  greater diversity, Calix will engage  with female and diverse university  students to foster interest and  attract talent in Science, Technology,  Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).  Gender balance at all levels of  the organisation.  OUR PROGRESS & WHAT’S NEXT  At Calix, sustainability means meeting our  own needs without compromising the ability  of future generations to meet theirs. It is  deeply embedded in our purpose – solving  global challenges.  Together, we are working towards three  ambitious goals by 2030. These goals,  selected by the Volunteer Sustainability  Team, and ratified by the Board, represent  how Calix is addressing some of the most  material risks and opportunities: carbon  emissions, diversity and inclusion, and  environmental impacts.  Address the sustainability of the  materials and resources we use in  our business.  Gender balance at all levels of  the organisation.  Science-based emission reduction in  line with the 1.5°C pathway.  In addition to the Company’s three 2030  sustainability ambitions, the health and  safety of our people continues as always  to be our primary operational focus. Health  and safety is so paramount that it serves as  a gateway to Calix's bonus structure. The  bonus can be awarded only when safety  KPIs are fully met each year.  The following section of the FY24  Sustainability Report outlines the headway  we’ve made over the past year against these  goals and provides a view of the future.  We are pleased to share our progress as  we remain steadfast in our commitment to  building a more sustainable planet.  OUR SUSTAINABILITY  AMBITIONS  AMBITION  10  INTRODUCTION  COMMUNITY  APPENDIX SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2024  RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS SUSTAINABILITY AMBITIONS   ===== PAGE 13 ===== – Following the identification of Calix’s top sources  of emissions – which include the processing and  transportation of our magnesium-based product –  we held internal discussions around how to improve  the way we procure, process, and transport materials  through our value chain.  – The Company also continued to explore ways  to minimise waste from our Intermediate Bulk  Containers (IBCs), which are used to transport  our Magnesium Hydroxide Liquid (MHL) products,  including distributing 38 IBCs for reuse and trialling  cardboard IBCs for recycling.  – Calix commenced the development of an  Environmental Management System (EMS) to help  further identify and manage operational risks related  to the environment.  – In FY25, Calix will explore Lifecycle Assessment  frameworks and tools to support the evaluation  of applications of our core platform technology,  ensuring we optimise the use of material inputs.  – Calix intends to evolve the sustainability strategy and  set clear qualifications for our environmental impact  reduction efforts. In FY25, Calix will analyse site  operations to identify opportunities to further reduce  waste and increase resource efficiencies.  – Building on the framework of the EMS, Calix plans to  introduce a monitoring mechanism of environmental  impact issues and incidents, enhancing the way we  control material environmental risks.  – The Company will begin to incorporate sustainable  procurement practices as new demonstration plants  and facilities are built.  Address the sustainability of the materials and  resources we use in our business.  – Calix introduced monthly company-wide safety updates to foster  communication between the safety team and the wider group.  – To further increase awareness around relevant safety topics, the  Company established noticeboards at each plant site.  – The Company started a safety alert program, issuing safety  alerts with information, including key response actions, following  certain incidents.  – Calix continued to adopt industry best practices by transitioning  from Job Safety Analyses to Safe Work Method Statements – a  key component of Australia’s Work Health and Safety mandate.  – The Company made strong progress enhancing overall safety  reporting, broadening the focus from Calix’s technology centre,  Bacchus Marsh, to the rest of the organisation.  – Calix invested efforts into safety culture, whereby the  executive leadership team conducted walk and talks, incident  investigations and audits with staff with the purpose of  communicating ultimate intent of the activity.  – Calix will roll out an updated Health & Safety management  system, enhancing usability and effectiveness.  Zero harm in the business through a safe  working environment.  11 Sustainability Ambitions — Our progress & what’s next   ===== PAGE 14 ===== MINIMISING IMPACTS ON  THE ENVIRONMENT  DECARBONISATION  Emissions  In FY22, Calix committed to reducing  our GHG emissions in line with the 1.5 °C  pathway set by the 2015 Paris Agreement.  This target follows science-based guidance  of limiting global temperature warming  to a level that avoids the most severe  impact of climate change. As a company  helping hard-to-abate industrial sectors to  decarbonise, Calix is strongly aligned with  this goal. Over the past two years, our team  has worked in earnest under the guidance of  carbon management consultants to gather  the information needed to understand our  GHG footprint. The Company’s FY23 GHG  inventory serves as a starting indicator  of emissions hotspots and persistent  data gaps. We will continue to implement  improvements to both reduce emissions  and aid in data gathering in the months and  years ahead.  As a result of improving the accuracy of  Calix’s Scope 3 data, and the additional  inclusion of the MHL products developed  by our business in the US, the Company’s  estimated GHG footprint for FY23 increased  from FY22. The increase is not a result of  any significant changes in Calix’s operations  or business strategy. We continue to  improve data collection and expect to have  a comprehensive baseline of our FY24  footprint in next year’s report. To ensure our  efforts are at the pace and scale in line with  the Paris Agreement, we intend to pursue  a third-party validated decarbonisation  target following the establishment of our  FY24 baseline.  With oversight from the Board, supported  by the Sustainability Committee, our  Volunteer Sustainability Team is working  across Calix to explore, prioritise and  execute initiatives to drive the reduction of  our GHG footprint.  1. Note: Due to rounding, percentages may not total exactly 100%.  Scope 1 emissions  In FY23, Calix’s Scope 1 emissions were  estimated to be 2,791 tCO2-e, representing  approximately 15.6% of the Company’s total  carbon footprint. These encompass the  direct emissions from Calix’s operations,  such as the burning of natural gas in  magnesite calcination to produce our MHL  products, fuel consumed by Company- owned vehicles and equipment, including  those used at our Myrtle Springs mine site,  as well as the use and leakage of refrigerant  gases at Calix offices and plants.  Scope 2 emissions  In FY23, Calix’s Scope 2 emissions were  estimated to be 587.5 tCO2-e, representing  3.3% of the Company’s total carbon  footprint. These encompass indirect  emissions resulting from Calix’s operations,  such as energy from electricity purchased  for consumption at the Company’s offices  and plants.  Scope 3 emissions  In FY23, Calix’s Scope 3 emissions  were estimated to be 14,558.4 tCO2-e,  representing 81.2% of the Company’s  total carbon footprint. These encompass  indirect emissions resulting from all other  upstream and downstream emissions across  our value chain, such as purchased goods  and services, business travel, and fuel  consumption related to the transport and  operation of stationary equipment.  Scope 3 emissions provide an indication of  the emission sources outside the Company’s  direct control. Calix is not immune to the  data gaps commonly encountered for  these indirect emissions. As part of the  Company’s next GHG footprint assessment,  we will complete another boundary-setting  exercise to expand the scope as well as  work with suppliers to improve our overall  reporting. We also recognise the outsized  impact Calix’s Scope 3 emissions have on  the Company’s emissions footprint and the  particular complexities of reducing these  emissions. Opportunities to improve the  Company’s supplier selection process and  increase supplier engagement are some of  the strategies currently being developed  to reduce Scope 3 emissions in addition to  resolving key data gaps.

Each year, the Board approves Key  Performance Indicators (KPIs) as part of the  Company’s Safety, Health, Environment, and  Quality Action Plan. This acts as the first  performance gateway for the Company’s  Employee Incentive Scheme (EIS), in which  rights or options can only be awarded if  the safety KPIs are achieved for that year.  This mechanism aims to demonstrate Calix’s  commitment to safety at the highest level.  In addition, safety is the first agenda item at  all Board and leadership team meetings. To  further encourage safe work practices and  engagement, actions that contribute to a  positive safety culture are now recognised  at monthly all-staff and site meetings.  The Company’s dedicated Health & Safety  team meets monthly to review incidents,  share findings, and identify actions and  preventative measures, with a targeted  attendance KPI of 80%.  Calix’s commitment to safety and wellbeing  extends to anyone on-site, including people  who conduct contract work. To this end,  Calix is developing a contractor management  procedure that defines the activities required  to successfully and safely engage the  Company’s contractor workforce.  Safety management system  The Calix safety management system, which  covers all Calix-managed work, is grounded  in Calix’s Health, Safety and Environment  (HSE) Manual. The HSE manual links to  all critical and core procedures and their  associated templates, providing simple  access to all documents referenced within  the management system.  Training is an important component of the  broader safety approach to preventing  injury. All employees are required to  complete a safety training induction as part  of the Company’s onboarding process for  new employees. Any operations personnel  must also complete additional training  around manual handling, finger and hand  safety, how to use the safety management  system and report safety incidents.  Calix is dedicated to continuously improving,  with several significant safety system  advancements implemented in FY24 to  enhance suitability and effectiveness.  This redevelopment included a three- month review of all procedures, engaging  stakeholders at every level of the business.  The HSE Manual was updated to divide  processes into two main categories: critical  risk procedures and core procedures.  Critical Risk Procedures  The Critical Risk procedures describe  mandatory processes and controls to  protect people from the high-risk activities  - as defined in regulations - associated with  the work undertaken by Calix employees  and contractors. The procedures have  expanded to include additional high-risk  activities, reflecting Calix’s growth and new  undertakings. Each procedure includes  clearly defined activities and associated  accountabilities, ensuring that individuals  have a clear understanding of their roles and  responsibilities. This resource, along with  custom permit-to-work templates tailored to  each respective high-risk activity, creates the  foundation for effectively managing risks.  Core Procedures  The Core Procedures establish processes  to support the achievement of HSE- related objectives, drive continuous  improvement, and ensure the engagement  and participation of employees and other  stakeholders. Within the Core Procedure  set, Calix’s Creating Safe Work model has  been further developed to define the roles  and responsibilities of the job supervisor  and people doing the work. The model is  a cornerstone of the safety management  system and our operations.  In FY25, Calix will roll out the updated Health  & Safety management system across the  company through robust communications  and training to our workforce.

Physical safety  Safety continues to be Calix’s primary  operational focus. All incidents are reviewed,  and depending on their significance, are  investigated and reported to the Board.  Corrective actions are developed and  monitored to prevent recurrence and ensure  continuous improvement in Calix’s safety  management system.  The frequency of near-miss incidents is  regarded by Calix as a positive leading  indicator of safety culture, whereby all  employees are required to, and feel  empowered to, report all safety incidents,  including near misses. The Company  does not have a minimum criterion for  incident reporting. All material reports  undergo detailed investigations, analysing  root causes, sharing learnings across the  business, and where possible, preventative  actions are implemented.  Calix’s dedicated focus on improvement,  using industry best practice, meant that no  lost time injuries occurred in FY24, despite  significant operational activity.

An  internal Psychosocial Health Committee  was consequently formed to develop a  psychosocial health strategy. In FY24, the  Health & Safety Team, in consultation with  the Psychosocial Health Committee, hosted  workshops to gather input from team  members across our functions and regions  to identify opportunities for improvement.  Looking forward, the team will develop  strategies to best address the key risk  areas identified and institute monitoring of  psychosocial health risks to understand how  these risks evolve.  We understand our people are more than  employees, so in FY25, we will develop a  Digital Disconnection Policy to assist our  people in finding balance in their time  management. This is particularly important  for roles that are performed remotely.  A flexible and inclusive work environment  extends to all Calix employees, and  where possible we support our team with  arrangements to be their best at work  and home. This includes flexible working  arrangements, as well as wellbeing and  parental leave in some locations. Parental  leave is offered to primary and secondary  carers, and in FY24, 9 employees took  parental leave with everyone returning to  work following the completion of their leave.  100%  OF EMPLOYEES WHO TOOK PARENTAL  LEAVE RETURNED TO WORK  Employee Assistance Program  To foster continued wellbeing and support  mental health, all employees and their  families can access an independent  Employee Assistance Program (EAP). The  EAP provides confidential support and  counselling in response to the diverse  needs of Calix’s employees, including  personal, family or work-related concerns  affecting an employee or their family’s health  and wellbeing.  1. Per 200,000 hours.  2. Per 200,000 hours. Calix defines a ‘near-miss’ incident as any unsafe act, with no reporting threshold.  3. Per million hours.  HUMAN RIGHTS  Human rights, modern slavery and  child labour  Calix respects human rights as defined  by the United Nations Guiding Principles  on Business and Human Rights and has  implemented the Principles in our operational  policies and procedures. We support the  elimination of all forms of forced and  compulsory labour and the effective abolition  of child labour, modern slavery, and human  trafficking. Calix endeavours to ensure  human rights are strictly upheld throughout  our supply chain and operations. We  intend to continue building on our policies  and engage suppliers to further protect  fundamental human and labour rights.  Part of keeping our people safe  includes managing our plants in a way  that ensures ongoing protection while  working in and around the facility. Some  examples of initiatives implemented in  FY24 at our key technology centre in  Bacchus Marsh, include:  – Updating the Emergency Response  Plan to provide specificity around  appropriate response actions and  the people accountable.  – Adding traffic management  instructions to reduce the potential  for vehicular accidents as well  as revamping the Equipment  Location Map for improved clarity  and accuracy.  – Utilising more tools to convey  potential hazards, such as a site map  displaying active exclusion zones.  FACILITY SAFETY  & MANAGEMENT  19 Sustainability Ambitions — Protecting and investing in people   ===== PAGE 22 ===== An inherent value of Calix  is innovation:  We use first principles  thinking to challenge each  other and adapt quickly to  new opportunities.  CONTINUALLY  INNOVATING  In 2022, we set a goal for ourselves to have 100% sustainable  material inputs that are reusable, renewable and/or recyclable  by 2030. In the coming months, we will refine our broader  sustainability strategy, including our resource consumption  target to improve clarity around how we qualify our waste  reduction ambitions. Addressing our MHL product in Australia  was our starting point. Taking the learnings from the IBCs  pilot, we will continue investigating ways to best minimise the  negative outputs of our operations and amplify the positives.  Beyond MHL, we see opportunities for influence to minimise  waste and emissions, as well as support better socio-economic  outcomes via an innovative delivery model in our other  business lines.  As we move from the pilot phase to demonstration plants  to full-scale commercialisation, Calix recognises the need  to progress our procurement practices. We plan to map  our highest-spend suppliers in order to engage them in  efforts to reduce resource use and ensure human rights are  upheld throughout the supply chain. We will also introduce  sustainability as an evaluation criterion for new product and  supplier assessments. We believe embedding sustainability  throughout our supply chain will be mutually beneficial for Calix  and our stakeholders, helping to support continual innovation  in how our products are made and improving environmental  and socio-economic outcomes from our operations.  INNOVATING WITHIN OUR OPERATIONS  20  INTRODUCTION  COMMUNITY  APPENDIX  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2024  RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS  SUSTAINABILITY AMBITIONS   ===== PAGE 23 ===== Accelerating the transition to net zero  by providing the most compelling  decarbonisation solution for global cement  and lime.  Cement is the key ingredient in concrete, the most consumed  substance on Earth after water 1 . Cement provides the  foundations of modern life. Its production, however, is also  inherently carbon-intensive, accounting for ~8% of global  CO2 emissions 2.  Calix’s subsidiary, Leilac, aims to deliver a low-cost capture  solution for emissions released unavoidably in the production of  cement, without the use of additional chemicals or processes.  The Leilac technology is retrofittable, scalable, and compatible  with low-carbon alternative fuels, electrification and renewable  energy to provide viable solutions for near-zero emissions  cement and lime.  In FY24, Leilac-2 – an EU-funded demonstration project to  capture up to 100,000 tonnes of process CO2 per year – was  relocated to Heidelberg Materials’ cement plant in Ennigerloh,  Germany, following the closure of the Heidelberg Materials  Hannover cement plant. Construction of Leilac-2 is expected to  commence in 2025, following the conclusion of permitting.  Affordable and scalable decarbonisation solutions for cement  can accelerate a just transition to net zero by balancing social,  economic and environmental sustainability.  1.

DECARBONISING CEMENT & LIME  Applying the Leilac technology to atmospheric  carbon dioxide removal by Direct Air Capture  in partnership with Heirloom.  To achieve global climate goals, decarbonising alone will not be  enough. Centuries of industrialisation has released excess CO2  into our planet’s atmosphere, and these legacy emissions must  also be mitigated if we are to avoid the worst effects of climate  change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  projects 1-10 billion tonnes of atmospheric CO2 removal per  year is required to limit global warming to 1.5 °C.  Leilac and Heirloom, a Direct Air Capture (DAC) company,  have signed a global and perpetual licence agreement and  collaboration agreement to bring together two complementary  technologies designed to capture and remove CO2 from  the atmosphere. In FY24, extensive testing of the combined  technologies continued, and the development of two DAC  facilities in Shreveport, Louisiana was announced. The facilities  are designed to be capable of jointly removing up to 317,000  tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year – a  significant development in the global effort to address  climate change.  DIRECT AIR CAPTURE  21  Sustainability Ambitions — Continually innovating   ===== PAGE 24 ===== Enabling low carbon, low waste and  value-added mineral products with electric  mineral processing at the mine site.  With increasing demand for the critical minerals needed in a  decarbonising global economy, mineral processing must solve  sustainability challenges across the supply chain.  Calcination is one of the most energy-intensive steps in the  lithium battery materials supply chain. In a Joint Venture (JV)  with Pilbara Minerals (ASX: PLS), Calix is applying its electric  calcination technology to produce a concentrated low- carbon intensity lithium phosphate salt at Pilbara Minerals’  Pilgangoora operation.  The innovative ‘mid-stream’ process is designed to reduce the  carbon-energy intensity of spodumene calcination by more  than 90% when compared with using coal as the primary  source of thermal energy in rotary kiln calcination, and by more  than 80% when compared with the use of natural gas 1 .  Processing critical minerals at the mine site can also enable  enhanced ore recovery and avoid the transport of waste  through the conversion of ores to refined mineral products.  In FY24, the demonstration plant being developed in a JV  with Pilbara Minerals commenced construction, following a  successful Final Investment Decision.  Sustainable processing solutions, such as the production of  low-carbon lithium, have the potential to deliver a significant  reduction in the cost and environmental impact of critical  minerals, adding value to mineral exports and enabling a more  sustainable transition towards net zero.  Producing low-carbon and value-added green  metals through the decarbonisation of iron,  steel and alumina.  The production of iron, steel and aluminium together  account for approximately 11% of direct global greenhouse  gas emissions 1, 2. The processing of iron ore and bauxite to  form steel and aluminium is highly-energy intensive and  conventionally reliant on fossil fuels to power the process. The  iron and steel sector is particularly hard-to-abate, as coal is  also used as a reducing agent to convert iron ore to metallic  iron, as well as an energy source to heat the reaction.  Calix’s Zero Emissions Steel TechnologY (ZESTY) and Zero  Emissions ALumina (ZEAL) technology use renewably powered  electric heating to deliver clean and efficient mineral processing  – decoupling energy intensity from carbon intensity. ZESTY  is also designed to enable the most efficient use possible  of green hydrogen as a reductant, replacing the use of coal  in steelmaking.  In FY24, Calix completed its pilot scale testing of ZESTY and  a Front-End Engineering Design study for a ZESTY green  iron demonstration plant, whilst also progressing engineering  studies for ZEAL calciners.

CONTINUALLY INNOVATING  Calix’s ZESTY was listed among the top 17 Innovators in the  World Economic Forum’s First Movers Coalition Enabling  Technologies Steel Challenge in FY24.  This recognition is part of First Movers’ broader objective  to catalyse near-zero emission steel innovators –  demonstrating demand signal, triggering commercial  investment, promoting collaboration and identifying  obstacles to decarbonisation in the steel sector.  As essential materials within engineering and construction,  steel and aluminium play crucial roles in supporting  a number of the Sustainable Development Goals.  Decarbonising some of the world’s largest sources of  industrial emissions could add value to local iron ore and  alumina exports, future-proof local production and underpin  sustainable global development.  22  INTRODUCTION  COMMUNITY  APPENDIX  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2024  RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS  SUSTAINABILITY AMBITIONS   ===== PAGE 25 ===== 1. Calix ASX Announcement. FINAL INVESTMENT DECISION FOR MID-STREAM DEMONSTRATION PLANT. 2 Aug 2023.  Reducing waste by enabling the processing of  fine and ultrafine material.  A further advantage of processing minerals at the mine site is  the potential to increase the utilisation of the mineral resource  and reduce waste.  Fines and ultra-fines are the spectrum of the mined material  with a small particle size. Fines are often incompatible with  conventional thermal processing, where flue gases can simply  blow the fine material out of the calciner. Alternatively, fines can  be pelletised or agglomerated, however, this adds a potentially  cost-prohibitive processing step. As a result, fines are often  considered too difficult or expensive to handle and consigned  as waste.  Electric calcination and Calix’s flash calcination technology is  ideally suited to processing small particle sizes, enabling the  use of fines that would otherwise be discarded as waste. As  such, electric calcination at the mine site offers significant  potential to provide greater recovery and utilisation of the  mineral resource.  INCREASED UTILISATION OF MINERAL RESOURCES  Enabling renewably powered industrial  processes and grid-load balancing.  Electric calcination is compatible with intermittent renewable  energy sources, flexible operations and power generation  response to improve energy security and deliver more cost- effective operations.  Calix’s electric calcination technology is designed to enable fast  start-up and shut down, and highly flexible production rates  through a high turndown ratio. By leveraging this capability,  mineral producers can improve the cost-effectiveness of  renewably powered mineral processing by matching output to  demand and renewable energy costs.  For grid-connected facilities, electric mineral processing has  the potential to ramp down production and associated energy  requirements at times of high demand, thereby providing a  valuable load-balancing service to the energy grid. Given the  large energy requirements of industrial alumina or green iron  production, the electrification of such facilities and the use of  demand-side controls have the potential to deliver a valuable  stabilising service to renewably powered grids, complementing  supply-side measures such as battery storage. In turn, this  could support a reduction in grid infrastructure costs and  the inclusion of increased levels of renewable generation into  energy grids.  ELECTRIFICATION OF MINERAL PROCESSING  23  Sustainability Ambitions — Continually innovating   ===== PAGE 26 ===== Unique, bioactive materials to improve crop  protection and fight anti-microbial resistance.  Following many years of antibiotic overuse, antimicrobial  resistance is now a rapidly emerging global crisis. Reducing  reliance on conventional pesticides, biocides and antibiotics  is urgently needed. Calix’s unique non-toxic bioactive  materials show promising potential to suppress pathogenic  microorganisms, insect pests, and marine biofoulants through  a generally non-lethal mode of action with very low resistance  development potential.  In collaboration with Australia’s Cooperative Research Centre  for Solving Antimicrobial Resistance (CRC SAAFE), an ongoing  livestock health project confirmed Calix’s bioactive materials  provide quantifiable control of pathogenic and drug-resistant  animal and human bacteria.  Alternatives to products with lethal modes-of-action in  agriculture can help maintain biodiversity and reduce the risk of  future outbreaks of infectious diseases.  Magnesium-based products for safe,  effective and more sustainable water and  wastewater treatment.  Clean water and sanitation are central to achieving the SDGs.  Currently, 80% of wastewater flows back into the ecosystem  without being treated or reused, while existing water treatment  products, such as caustic soda, can have significant detrimental  environmental impacts 1.  Calix’s magnesium-based products are designed to minimise  the release of hazardous chemicals and materials into our  water systems. In FY24, Calix’s subsidiary, IER, opened two new  hydration facilities in the US to expand the reach of our more  sustainable water and wastewater treatment solutions.  Effective water and wastewater management prevents  pathogens, nutrients and other types of pollution from entering  the environment, protecting freshwater systems, oceans and  human health.  In 2024, Calix’s Australian-based MHL business retained  its ISO 9001 certification, demonstrating the Company’s  continued dedication to the highest standard of product  quality for our customers and the environment. While the  certification applies to our MHL business - representing  21% of our operations - the learnings and best-in-industry  approaches are integrated into our wider approach.

We are pleased to share our experience and  ideas in removing barriers and implementing sector-specific  and cross-cutting strategies for industrial decarbonisation  solutions. We also welcome the opportunity to contribute  towards collaborative efforts to achieve national and global  climate goals.  In FY24, Calix and its subsidiary, Leilac, were pleased to  contribute to government efforts to decarbonise industry  through submissions to the:  – Australian Government’s Carbon Leakage Review  – U.S. Department of Energy’s Request for Information on  Transforming Industry – Strategies for Decarbonization  – U.S. Department of Energy’s Request for Information  Regarding Launching a Responsible Carbon  Management Initiative  – Californian Air Resources Board’s Community Air Protection  Program Draft Blueprint 2.0  – Californian Air Resources Board’s Workshop for Net-Zero  Emissions Strategy for the Cement Sector  In July 2024, Calix was also pleased to respond to the Australian  Government’s Green Metals consultation and Critical Minerals  Production Tax Incentive consultation.  Calix acknowledges the support of government funding,  including from the European Union Horizon 2020 programme,  the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, the Australian  Government’s Modern Manufacturing Initiative, and the  Australian Government Modernisation Fund. Calix’s project  partners were also the beneficiaries of funding from the US  Department of Energy, the State of Louisiana, and the German- Australian HyGate Initiative.  PUBLIC POLICY ENGAGEMENT  25  Sustainability Ambitions — Continually innovating   ===== PAGE 28 ===== COMMUNITY  BENEFITING COMMUNITIES  Beyond the primary goal of GHG emission reduction, decarbonisation projects also have the  potential to deliver local community benefits. Calix’s delivery model for its decarbonisation  technology is designed to augment its projects’ primary objectives and create environmental,  health and socio-economic benefits for local communities.  By providing viable pathways to reach net zero, effective decarbonisation solutions can help  to create economically sustainable local industries in a decarbonising global economy. This  can support the retention of jobs and existing economic activity in a low-carbon economy. At  commercial scale, Calix will deliver its industrial decarbonisation solutions through a blueprint  model that aims to use local firms and local resources. This model is designed to maximise  the scale and speed of our impact, and share the value created by such projects with the  communities in which we operate.  Decarbonisation projects can also support improved environmental and health outcomes  beyond reducing GHG emissions. Switching industrial heat sources from coal and the  combustion of other fossil fuels to renewably generated electricity can deliver improved  air quality to the surrounding communities. Electrification can also reduce fugitive dust  emissions. Unlike other carbon capture solutions, the Leilac technology captures unavoidable  CO2 emissions without the use of additional chemicals or solvents that may otherwise enter  the local environment.  Embedding local community benefits into decarbonisation projects can help unify efforts to  address climate change and climate justice to deliver a just transition to net zero.  In FY24, Calix developed Community Benefit Plans for multiple projects. These plans embed  the delivery of community benefits in the objectives and budget of projects. They include  plans to establish community advisory panels to promote engagement with and feedback  from the local community; suggested local procurement, training and hiring targets that  include diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility considerations; and public outreach that  aims to raise awareness and foster acceptance of decarbonisation technologies.  UNITED STATES  Shreveport, Louisiana  In June 2024, Heirloom and Leilac  announced the construction of two major  DAC facilities in Northwest Louisiana.  With support from the U.S. Department  of Energy and the State of Louisiana, the  facilities will contribute to local economic  benefits and job creation – expecting to  create at least 1,000 construction jobs and  over 80 permanent jobs. The local benefits  that Heirloom’s facilities can deliver is  enhanced by Calix’s delivery model – using  industry partners and local resources – in  support of a just transition to sustainable  local industries.  Solutions that decarbonise industrial facilities and remove excess CO2 from the  atmosphere have the potential to deliver significant local community benefits in  addition to effective decarbonisation, including:  – Regional and permanent job creation  – Protection of economies historically reliant on local industrial activity  – Improved environmental and health benefits from reduced or even eliminated  emissions and pollutants released to the surrounding area  – Reduced global CO2 emissions and increased supply chain resilience through  sustainable local manufacturing  – Load balancing support for the local electricity grid, enabling increased  incorporation of renewable energy generation and lower costs.  26  INTRODUCTION  SUSTAINABILITY AMBITIONS  APPENDIX  SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2024  RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS  COMMUNITY   ===== PAGE 29 ===== OUR PARTNERSHIPS  Calix aims to closely align our philanthropic support with our business objectives,  benefiting the communities and environments in which we operate.

These include the  Company’s facilities in Australia (Bacchus Marsh, Nerang,  Myrtle Springs Mine Site, and the Pymble head office),  the United States (Pasco Plant, Muscatine Plant, Big Soo  Plant, Centralia Plant, and the Spokane Office), and Europe  (Leilac-1 Plant*).  *For the Leilac-1 plant, only the employee-related activities  and expenditures are covered in the boundary, not the  operation of the plant.  Temporal boundary  The emissions footprint included in this year’s report  represents FY23 (1 July 2022 – 30 June 2023.) Calix will  establish a full baseline year using its FY24 inventory  following a resetting of organisational boundaries. This is  part of an ongoing effort within the Company to build its  emissions reporting capabilities, especially as it relates to the  collection of Scope 3 emissions data.  Methodology  Scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions were calculated by Pangolin  Associates utilising industry standard methodology. The  global methodology is derived from the latest NGERS  methodology and associated emissions factors for Scopes  1 and 2 and aligned with the GHG Protocol Corporate and  Value Chain Standards for the Scope 3 methodology and  emissions factors. Emission factors were derived from the  National Greenhouse Accounts, SimaPro Software, IELab  Australia and Exiobase, the US EPA, and the UK Government.  They were calculated in conjunction with the IPCC 2021  GWP100 method. Where possible, data was sourced from  primary sources to represent real, full-year data, however, in  some instances, assumptions, extrapolations, and exclusions  were factored in due to limited access to complete data.

Carbon intensive conventional  production methods, however, mean iron and steel are  responsible for ~7% of global CO2 emissions3.  Calix’s Zero Emissions Steel TechnologY (ZESTY) is renewably  powered and is targeting the most efficient use of green  hydrogen as a reducing agent in the production of green iron  and steel. Decarbonising one of the world’s largest sources of industrial  emissions could add value to local iron ore exports,  future-proof local iron and steel production and underpin  sustainable global development. 3Climate change and the production of iron and steel. World Steel Association. 2021 12  ===== PAGE 13 ===== Global Challenge: With increasing demand for the critical minerals needed in a  decarbonising global economy, mineral processing must solve  sustainability challenges across the supply chain.  Calix’s at-mine electric mineral processing technology is being  designed to be renewably powered, enhance ore recovery, and  enable near zero-waste products.  Sustainable processing solutions, such as the production of  low-carbon lithium, have the potential to deliver a significant  reduction in the cost and environmental impact of critical  minerals, adding value to mineral exports and enabling a more  sustainable transition towards net zero.  SUSTAINABLE PROCESSING Sustainable  critical  minerals 13  ===== PAGE 14 ===== Global Challenge: The ongoing, rapid growth of the global battery market makes  finding more economical and sustainable production methods  increasingly important to meeting the Sustainable  Development Goals. Calix is pioneering a renewably powered, energy efficient and  low-cost chemistry agnostic platform technology designed to  produce sustainable high-performance nanostructured battery  materials. Better, more sustainable batteries are an essential enabling  technology for our clean energy future, helping to decarbonise  transport and stabilise renewably powered energy grids. Making  better  batteries ADVANCED BATTERIES 14  ===== PAGE 15 ===== Global Challenge: Clean water and sanitation are central to achieving the  Sustainable Development Goals. Currently, 80% of wastewater  flows back into the ecosystem without being treated or reused,  while existing water treatment products, such as caustic soda,  can have significant environmental impacts4.  Calix’s magnesium-based products are designed to minimise  the release of hazardous chemicals and materials into our  water systems, to provide a safe and sustainable solution for  water and wastewater treatment. Effective water and wastewater management prevents  pathogens, nutrients and other types of pollution from  entering the environment, protecting freshwater systems,  oceans and human health. WATER Sustainable  water  treatment 4http://www.unwater.org/water-facts/quality-and-wastewater  15  ===== PAGE 16 ===== Global Challenge: Following many years of antibiotic overuse, antimicrobial resistance is now a rapidly emerging global crisis. Reducing reliance on conventional pesticides, biocides and antibiotics is  urgently needed.  Calix’s unique non-toxic bioactive materials show promising  potential to suppress pathogenic microorganisms, insect pests,  and marine bio-foulants through a generally non-lethal mode of  action with very low resistance development potential.   Novel bioactive materials could provide sustainable replacements  to polluting or damaging products in agriculture and marine  coatings and help address the rise of antimicrobial resistance.  Antimicrobial  resistance BIOTECH 16  ===== PAGE 17 ===== At Calix, sustainability is not simply a                     box-checking exercise; it is deeply embedded in  our DNA. It is the fundamental reason we exist:  to solve global challenges. Sustainability steers   our decision-making, shapes our strategies and  inspires our innovation.  This year, we proudly reaffirm our dedication  to sustainability by recommitting to the United  Nations Global Compact (UNGC), the world’s  largest sustainability initiative, of which we  have been a participant since 2020.  We are guided by the Ten Principles of the  UNGC to align our operations with global  sustainability targets. In embracing these  principles, we strive to make a positive impact,  be a catalyst for change and contribute to a  sustainable future for all.   Why? Because Mars is for quitters. SUSTAINABILITY IS IN OUR DNA 17  ===== PAGE 18 ===== LETTERS TO SHAREHOLDERS 18  ===== PAGE 19 ===== Peter Turnbull AM Non-Executive Chair A message from the Chair I am pleased to present the Calix Limited Annual Report for the 2023 Financial Year (FY23). Calix has continued to gather momentum, propelled by Environmental, Social and Governance  (ESG) tailwinds, as the world focuses its attention on escalating climate change realities and  the urgent need for widespread global decarbonisation. Despite the slowdown in global growth  driven by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, war in Ukraine, significant inflationary pressures  and supply chain disruptions, the interest, commitment and capital available for solutions that  align with ESG goals (particularly those that will assist governments, industry and investors to  meet their net zero commitments) continue to grow very substantially.  Groundbreaking policies to drive decarbonisation were announced across the planet in FY23,  including: • a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism and Net-Zero Industry Act in Europe; • the Inflation Reduction Act and Regional Direct Air Capture hubs in the USA; and • Safeguard Mechanism, Powering the Regions Fund, National Reconstruction Fund, and Critical      Minerals Strategy in Australia.   These policies recognise the need for urgent, affordable and scalable solutions that balance  social, economic and environmental sustainability to solve some of the greatest global  challenges of our time.  Calix is urgently developing great businesses with the potential to enable: the electrification of  industries; efficient capture of unavoidable emissions; and new sustainable industrial processes.  Despite an otherwise uncertain global economic outlook, I firmly believe that Calix is well placed  to thrive as the Group works towards progressing its core purpose.  ''Groundbreaking policies to drive decarbonisation were  announced across the planet in FY23'' 19  ===== PAGE 20 ===== Strong balance sheet propels investment in growth and  commercialisation In FY23, Calix achieved a gross profit of $6.2m, up from $5.2m in the 2022 Financial  Year (FY22). An increase in sales revenue to $29.6m, compared with $20.8m in FY22,  was supported by new sales within existing regions of Calix’s Water business, as well  as new sales regions across the USA.  Throughout FY23, Calix continued its planned investment in people, plant and  equipment to enhance and accelerate technology development, including a new  laboratory at Bacchus Marsh in Victoria, and professional services to advance  commercialisation. Some of this investment has been supplemented by grants and  tax rebates from governments in the various countries in which we operate. A $60.0m  private placement in October 2022 and a $21.6m Share Purchase Plan, which was  completed in November 2022 with strong support from our existing shareholders,  will provide ongoing capital and balance sheet strength to pursue our strategic  objectives.  Leilac  Calix’s CO2 mitigation line of business, Leilac, exists to accelerate the transition to  net zero by developing the most efficient and effective solution for the abatement  of industrial and atmospheric CO2. It has continued a significant transformation in  FY23 as it continued to commercialise and scale its technology for cement and lime  decarbonisation. This follows an investment in Leilac from one of the world’s leading  decarbonisation investors, Carbon Direct, of €15m in September 2021 for a 6.98%  stake to accelerate the deployment of the Leilac technology. Key commercialisation milestones during the financial period include: • Leilac signed a global licence agreement with Heidelberg Materials (FWB: HEI); • three projects with CEMEX S.A.B. de C.V. (NYSE: CX) were announced in Germany,  Poland and the USA; and • a zero-emissions lime project with Tarmac, a CRH company (LON: CRH, NYSE: CRH)  passed the due diligence phase of the UK Government’s Industrial Carbon Capture  funding scheme. In FY23, Leilac also announced the application of the Leilac technology for Direct Air  Capture (DAC) in a partnership with DAC company, Heirloom. The partnership aims  to integrate Leilac’s electric kiln technology into Heirloom’s DAC process for removal  of atmospheric CO2. Leilac’s pipeline of projects continues to grow, accelerated by  the decarbonisation commitments made by industry and governments, and societies’  ongoing reliance on cement and lime which will be a long-term need.    Sustainable Processing Calix’s patented core technology platform is designed to help mineral and chemical  processing enter the electric age. The Australian Government’s Australian Renewable  Energy Agency (ARENA) announced a $947,000 grant in November 2022 to  support the design of a renewably powered direct hydrogen reduced iron (H-DRI)  demonstration plant. Testing and design work for the 30,000 tonne per annum zero  CO2 emissions ZESTY iron plant continues, with a Front-End Engineering and Design  study expected to be completed by the end of calendar year 2023.  Initial pilot-scale  testing showed excellent metallisation of a range of iron ore types with ZESTY. In November 2022, Calix executed a joint venture with Pilbara Minerals (ASX: PLS)  to develop a novel mid-stream lithium processing technology to produce low carbon,  low waste, and high value lithium salt. The joint venture made significant progress  during FY23 on the detailed engineering and design of a demonstration plant that  aims to utilise Calix’s electric calcination technology at Pilbara Minerals’ Pilgangoora  Project with support from an Australian Government grant of $20m. We were pleased  to announce in August 2023 the Financial Investment Decision to proceed with the  project. In response to significant market demand, Calix is continuing to explore  multiple further applications of its electric calcination technology, including for other  critical minerals and alumina. 20  ===== PAGE 21 ===== Advanced Batteries Calix is pioneering a renewably powered, energy efficient and low-cost chemistry  agnostic platform technology to produce high-performance nanostructured battery  materials. In FY23, the team produced commercial-prototype Lithium Manganese  Oxide (LMO) battery cells in collaboration with UK production partner, AMTE (LON:  AMTE), demonstrating Calix LMO’s high-power capabilities. Calix also expanded its battery production capability to new chemistries favoured  by the electric vehicle segment of the battery market. As the global transition to  electric vehicles and energy grids powered by renewables and storage accelerates,  demand for affordable, more sustainable lithium-ion battery materials with superior  performance and safety is growing. By 2030, global battery capacity is expected  to grow more than fivefold with an estimated total addressable market of over  US$400b. Biotech Calix’s Biotech business is developing high surface area magnesium oxide materials  with high bioactivity for target applications in agriculture, marine and antimicrobial  resistance (AMR). In agriculture, additional field trials are underway to extend the  registration label of Calix’s crop protection product, BOOSTER-Mag. In the marine sector, Calix successfully completed tests with leading global  coatings firms, with further tests and coatings formulation work underway in  at sites across North America, Australia, NZ and Asia. In FY23, Calix became a  Tier 1 partner in Australia’s Cooperative Research Centre Solving Antimicrobial  Resistance in Agribusiness, Food, and Environments (CRC SAAFE), with the first  project underway, studying the application of Calix bioactive materials in intensive  livestock. AMR is internationally recognised as a global crisis, projected to cost the  global economy US$100 trillion and cause 10 million deaths per year by 2050, thus  requiring urgent solutions. Water Water and wastewater management is a challenge that can threaten vital  waterways, impacting health and the environment. Calix’s magnesium oxide  materials provide safe, more effective, economical and sustainable solutions for the  treatment of water and wastewater.  New product development has helped to secure new business within existing  hydration plant regions in the Pacific Northwest and Upper Midwest of the United  States. Revenue growth of 14.2% coupled with strong margins led to a gross profit  increase of 28.6%. Revenue growth accelerated during the year, with growth in the  second half of FY23 up 28% compared with the same period in FY22. Regulatory tailwinds in North America continue to drive growth in the magnesium  hydroxide market.  In FY23, significant progress was made in building two new hydration plants in  Ripon, Wisconsin and Lufkin, Texas, with both new plants expected to commence  operations by the end of 2023.  21  ===== PAGE 22 ===== Continuous improvement in ESG practices As Calix endeavours to solve critical environmental global challenges, we are also  making progress towards greater sustainability in our own operations, delivering  continuous improvement in our internal ESG practices. In November 2022, Calix  reaffirmed its commitment to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) – the  world’s largest sustainability initiative – of which Calix has been a participant since  2020. The UNGC and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) continue as guiding  beacons for Calix’s sustainability journey. In FY23, the board established a new Sustainability Committee. In addition  to updating the Board Charter and Code of Conduct Policy, we replaced the  Remuneration and Nomination Committee with a new People and Culture Committee  and charter, and updated charters for the Audit and Risk Committee, and Technology  Committee. Also, during the financial period, we completed our inaugural greenhouse  gas assessment, which is providing an accurate and transparent foundation on which  Calix will develop an emission reduction roadmap for its operations and supply chain  in FY24.    Complemented by various initiatives to foster health, wellbeing, diversity and  inclusion, the safety of Calix’s employees continues to be our primary operational  focus. All injuries, incidents, investigation outcomes and near-misses are reported  to the board, demonstrating a strong reporting culture, as we, of course, work to  prevent reoccurrence and improve safety in general. We continue to foster a forward- looking preventive culture and seek to learn from all relevant incidents and safety  related events. People development and culture Calix has a dynamic workforce spread across many countries. We understand that our  people drive our performance. Calix fosters a culture of providing on-going personal  and career development opportunities to our workforce, as well as a framework  of close communication and listening with our workforce. As we grow rapidly, we  continue to focus on building a collaborative, diverse and supportive culture across  the whole team around the world. Proactive board succession and renewal Over the last few years, the board has continued to maintain a proactive approach  to board succession and renewal, with the goal of ensuring the size and composition  of the board is appropriate to support the continued delivery of Calix’s growth  strategies, as well as being positioned to meet prevailing best practice governance  standards.   As part of this process, in February 2023, Calix announced the appointment of Alison  Deans as a Non-Executive Director and the retirement of Non-Executive Director, Dr.  Jack Hamilton from the Calix board of directors. Representing the next stage of the  board renewal process, Alison Deans’ appointment, in addition to further renewal  being planned, will strengthen the collective skills and experience of the Calix board.  On behalf of the board of directors and the whole Calix team, I would like to express  my sincere gratitude to Jack Hamilton for his substantial and valuable contribution to  Calix over many years. His commitment and wise counsel have provided considerable  benefit to the Group. We all wish him well in the future.  We expect to make further announcements in relation to board renewal and  expansion in the near future.     On behalf of the board of directors, I would like to thank Calix’s customers and  partners for their continued commitment and collaboration as we work together  to solve global challenges. The board also sincerely thanks all Calix’s employees  and contractors for their tireless efforts, talent and unwavering commitment to our  purpose and goals. We enter FY24 with significant ambitions to continue to progress  our key projects and develop and commercialise the next applications of Calix’s  remarkable core technology platform. It is thanks to the depth and breadth of our  growing team and our network of collaborative partners that we can hope to realise  the potential we see.   Finally, we would like to thank our Calix shareholders for their vital and ongoing  support, and we look forward to keeping you informed of Calix’s progress across  FY24. Peter Turnbull AM Non-Executive Chair 22  ===== PAGE 23 ===== Phil Hodgson    Managing Director  and CEO A message from the CEO As outlined in the Chair’s message, against a background of some financial turbulence,  the strength of the global thematic of decarbonisation of industry continues to grow. We  successfully raised capital in November 2022 to invest in the opportunities this presents for  Calix, and we have done so. Our biggest investment in the 2023 financial year (FY23) has been in our team, which has  grown by 61 full-time positions to 129, including 37 new engineers and scientists, to support  research, development, and the delivery of a growing number of projects and opportunities.  Our people, from our newest recruits to those who have been on the journey from the start,  are consistent in their determination to make a positive difference for the longer-term,  coupled with a sense of urgency. It’s a mindset that aligns with our values, is the core of our  success to date, and will continue to drive our success into the future. ''Our biggest investment in the 2023 financial year (FY23)  has been in our team, which has grown by 61 full-time  positions to 129.'' 23  ===== PAGE 24 ===== Accelerating commercialisation to address global challenges The 2022 financial year marked the first realisation of our strategy to seek equity  directly into our subsidiary businesses to focus on rapid commercialisation, with  the partial spin out of our cement and lime decarbonisation business, Leilac. In  FY23, we have started to realise the benefits we anticipated from such a strategy,  with the investment enabling significant growth in a specialist cement and lime  decarbonisation focused team. This has resulted in a rapid project pipeline build.  Leilac’s licence agreement with Heidelberg Materials (FWB: HEI), three projects with  Cemex S.A.B. de C.V. (NYSE: CX) and another with Tarmac (LON: CRH, NYSE: CRH),  plus a new partnership with Direct Air Capture company, Heirloom are all examples of  our strategy in action.   Our joint venture with Pilbara Minerals (ASX: PLS) passed another significant  milestone in August 2023, with a positive Financial Investment Decision from the  boards of both companies. The decision follows the official formation of the joint  venture in November 2022. A demonstration plant, using Calix’s patented electric  calcination technology, aims to significantly reduce carbon emissions and waste, while  producing small but commercial quantities of a concentrated sustainable lithium salt  product. We believe it’s a compelling proposition for the lithium industry, creating  environmental and economic value, and rationalising supply chains for key battery  markets in Europe and the US.  Our water business continued a very positive growth trend that started after the  impact of the COVID-19 pandemic subsided. Despite the delays in deployment of new  manufacturing facilities, largely resulting from the pandemic, they are now nearly  ready to launch into two significant markets in Texas and Wisconsin, where we have  already started seeding sales. We remain excited by the organic growth potential in  the US, especially as regulations tighten on wastewater discharge. We will remain  focused on this in the 2024 financial year (FY24). The next big opportunities While we progress direct sales in water, and licensing, joint ventures and spin-out  strategies to expedite the commercialisation of cement, lime and lithium, Calix’s next  big opportunities are developing rapidly. Driven by our talented team of scientists  and engineers, and supported by collaborations and partnerships with academia and  industry, we are developing our Zero Emissions Steel TechnologY or “ZESTY”, and  more recently accelerating new applications such as alumina, in response to policy  change and market demand. They represent significant opportunities. We also commissioned our new laboratory at our Bacchus Marsh facility in Victoria,  Australia to significantly increase our capability and capacity to assess new  opportunities for the core technology. To date, this area has been a bottleneck in  our growth, as inbound interest has far exceeded our assessment capacity. We will  continue to invest in increasing our assessment capacity in FY24 in response to this  demand.  Fuelling delivery Calix’s strong balance sheet continues to provide the capacity to pursue  commercialisation opportunities across the breadth of the Company’s business.  It is the result of solid revenue and margin growth in our water business in the US,  grants and tax rebates from government, and ongoing fiscal prudence. It was further  bolstered by the capital raised through a private placement and share purchase plan  in late 2022. By design, we retain flexibility to pursue the right capital strategy for  each investment opportunity across the business.  Looking ahead In FY23 an unprecedented array of government policies and programs were  announced across the planet to support governments, industries and communities  to decarbonise and meet net-zero commitments. For Calix, these policies and  programs were complemented by demand from industry and investors, despite the  turbulent global economic environment. The favourable tailwinds generated by the  pursuit of environment, social and governance goals, combined with Calix’s business  strategy, talented people and solid balance sheet see Calix well positioned for another  landmark year in FY24.   In FY24, our primary focus will continue to be developing and applying our core  platform technology to multiple industrial decarbonisation challenges. We will  progress various key projects through important engineering milestones, including  the commencement of civil works for Leilac-2 and construction of the demonstration  plant at Pilbara Minerals’ Pilgangoora project. We will also urgently develop emerging  opportunities, such as electrification of alumina refining, and aim to demonstrate the  potential for a more sustainable and cost-effective production process for cathode  active materials used in lithium-ion batteries. In FY24, Calix will combine its water and biotech businesses into a consolidated  “Magnesia” line of business. This change is designed to increase the focus, scale and  reach of Calix’s magnesium-based products to help drive new revenues and support  future growth opportunities.   I would like to thank the Calix board for its strategic guidance throughout FY23. I  would also like to thank our customers and partners for their ongoing collaboration,  and the dedication and support they continue to provide to help us achieve our  vision. I would especially like to recognise and thank our people for their unrelenting  commitment and drive towards realising our purpose. It is a remarkably talented and  determined team. Finally, I would like to thank our shareholders for their continued  support and belief in the Company. We look forward to significantly progressing our businesses in FY24.

The innovative ‘mid-stream’ refining process is being developed in a joint venture between Calix and  Pilbara Minerals (ASX: PLS) and is supported by $20m in Australian Government funding. A step closer   to sustainable lithium  31  ===== PAGE 32 ===== Calix’s electric processing  technology  The proposed mid-stream refining  plant is designed to show the potential  for renewably powered processing of  spodumene at the mine site. With a  full production capacity of more than  3,000 tonnes per year of concentrated  lithium-phosphate salt product, from a  feedstock of around 27,000 tonnes per  year of spodumene – including lower  grade fine spodumene concentrate                     – the project aims to demonstrate: · Reduced carbon intensity                                   – electrification of the mid-stream  process, including spodumene calcining,  can enable the use of up to 100%  renewably sourced power and deliver  a vast reduction in carbon emission  intensity of the lithium product. · Reduced waste – a concentrated  and near zero-waste lithium product  would allow waste material to be left  at the mine site, providing further  cost and emissions savings through  reduced and simplified transport  and logistics.  · Reduced cost – lower capital and  operating costs with Calix’s electric  calciner compared with conventional  calcining processes. · Value add – a lithium rich product  produced at the mine site may  enable more value to be captured  onshore at the mineral resource. 32  ===== PAGE 33 ===== Enabling low-carbon lithium  Life Cycle Assessment studies commissioned by Pilbara  Minerals analysed the carbon footprint of the proposed  mid-stream lithium phosphate salt product, in addition to  comparing β-spodumene produced via electric calcination  and conventional rotary kiln calcination5.   The study found that electric calcination powered entirely  by renewable electricity would reduce the carbon emissions  intensity of spodumene calcination by more than 90%  compared with a conventional coal-fired rotary kiln, and by  more than 80% when compared with natural gas.  Significant emissions reductions are also anticipated from  the mid-stream product by avoiding the transport of waste  associated with spodumene concentrate. Current practices  involve shipping spodumene that is approximately 6% lithium  and 94% waste from the mine site to be processed overseas.  Production of a zero waste, concentrated lithium phosphate  product would further reduce aggregate emissions across  the lithium supply chain.  5Based on cradle-to-gate Life Cycle Assessment studies completed by Minviro Ltd.:  evaluating production of Lithium Hydroxide Monohydrate (LHM) from Pilgangoora  spodumene concentrate using conventional calcination; and evaluating the production  of lithium phosphate from Pilgangoora spodumene concentrate using Calix’s electric  calcination technology.  The assessments calculated the carbon footprint for the  production of each chemical from the mine to the factory gate. A further study  evaluated the product carbon footprint of β-spodumene production via conventional  and electric calcination.  Mid-Stream Demonstration Plant location and layout. Depiction of a 3.1MW Calix electric calciner for a mid-stream lithium  processing demonstration plant. 33  ===== PAGE 34 ===== Rationalising international supply chains  Demand for lithium to support the rapidly growing  global battery market continues to intensify. With the  battery market now expected to grow five-fold by 20306,  governments around the world are seeking to develop  sovereign capabilities and reliable supply chains.  Electrification of mineral processing and the use of  locally sourced renewable energy offers significant  opportunities for Australian producers to develop highly  competitive and future-proof downstream processing  solutions. By doing so, producers could add value to  minerals by converting low-value ores into high-value  products, reducing emissions and rationalising supply  chains.    Commercialisation to the global spodumene  industry  Calix and Pilbara Minerals aim to develop an innovative  pathway for Australia to become a reliable supplier of  sustainably refined lithium to the world. Successful  demonstration of the mid-stream process may lead to its  commercialisation, with the joint venture able to license  the technology to Pilbara Minerals’ commercial scale  plants and the global spodumene processing industry.   “Calix is delighted to have successfully passed  the Financial Investment Decision milestone for a  sustainable lithium demonstration plant developed  in our joint venture with Pilbara Minerals. Together,  we look forward to demonstrating the potential of  our electric calcination technology to dramatically  reduce the carbon footprint of Australian lithium.”   Andrew Okely General Manager – Commercial Carbon footprint impact             -carbon emissions intensity of spodumene                            calcination by renewably powered electric                        calcination vs a coal-fired rotary kiln.            -carbon emissions intensity of spodumene                                     calcination by renewably powered electric                       calcination vs a natural gas-fired rotary kiln. 80% 90% 6Global lithium-ion battery capacity to rise five-fold by 2030 34  ===== PAGE 35 ===== Leilac’s technology:  from demonstration  to full scale Leilac is the exclusive licensee of Calix’s Low Emissions  Intensity Lime and Cement (Leilac) CO2 capture technology.  It is the collaborative technology partner aiming to accelerate  a just transition to net zero by providing the most compelling  decarbonisation solution for global cement and lime.  35  ===== PAGE 36 ===== Scaling up – the next milestone Leilac’s demonstration plant – Leilac-2 – aims to develop a  retrofittable, integrated module for capture of process CO2  emissions released unavoidably in the production of cement  and lime. Leilac-2 follows the Leilac-1 pilot, which successfully  demonstrated separation of unavoidable process emissions,      with no additional chemicals or processes. Leilac-2 is an  important de-risking step for the full-scale commercialisation of  the Leilac technology as a retrofit to an existing cement plant.                                It is designed to pave the way for the Leilac technology to be  optimised, replicated and applied at any scale.  Leilac-2 aims to provide:  •	Separation capacity of ~100,000 tonnes per year of CO2 at  >95% purity; •	A retrofittable, modular design that can be replicated and  applied at any scale; •	Minimal disruption to the host plant;  •	Future-proof fuel options, including alternative fuels; and  •	Progress on the electrification of the Leilac technology.  Leilac-2 is designed to deliver a lighter, cheaper and simplified  multi-tube furnace module. Importantly, the design accelerates  the vision of a low-cost, scalable and accessible capture solution.  Leilac-2 commissioning and testing was planned to commence in  late 2024. A longer than expected permitting process is likely to  push commissioning and testing into 2025.

The industry accounts for ~7-9%  of global CO2 emissions, with the  majority resulting from the use of  metallurgical coal in the reduction       of iron ore to metallic iron7.   ZESTY is designed to enable direct  hydrogen reduction of iron ore  (H-DRI) in a renewably powered  reactor to produce green iron and  ultimately, green steel. It provides  the potential for a zero-carbon  route to iron and steel that can help  add value to local iron ore exports,                            future-proof local iron and steel  production, and support sustainable  global development. 7Climate change and the production of iron and steel.                 World Steel Association. 2021 38  ===== PAGE 39 ===== Process flow diagram for ZESTY green steel production. Electrification-ready ZESTY’s indirect heating approach is  well suited for electrification, including  with renewable and intermittent energy  sources. Electrification also means no  combustion. With ZESTY, hydrogen is  consumed only as a reductant, not as  a fuel, and can be simply recycled in  the process. This key feature enables  ZESTY to target the most efficient and  economical use possible of hydrogen. 39  ===== PAGE 40 ===== Pilot results Pilot-scale testing shows that Calix’s ZESTY  technology can produce a H-DRI product approaching  commercial grade. Excellent metallisation was achieved for Siderite and  Goethite / Hematite ores. ZESTY’s compatibility with  small particle sizes was found to facilitate fast rates  of metallisation, allowing for significantly shorter  residence times and lower temperature operation than  a conventional blast furnace. Hematite makes up 96%  of Australia’s exported iron ore8 and is not otherwise  suited to most electric arc furnace (EAF) methods. Reduction and metallisation extents for the                       non-porous and dense magnetite sample were lower,  reaching a maximum metallisation degree of 54%  at 1050°C. An increase in residence time and/or  temperature for the processing of dense, non-porous  magnetite samples is expected to lead to improved  reduction and metallisation of magnetite by ZESTY.

It presents an enormous and important  environmental and economic opportunity. We look  forward to continuing to work closely with ARENA  and our partners in industry and academia as we  develop and commercialise ZESTY.” Tom Dufty Technology Innovation Manager 41  ===== PAGE 42 ===== New lab facilities    accelerating  technology  development A new multi-purpose laboratory opened at Calix’s Bacchus  Marsh facility in Victoria, Australia. It provides a significant  increase to Calix’s research and development capabilities  and capacity, helping to speed up project development and  drive new innovative applications of Calix's core platform  technology.  Supported by grant funding from the Australian Government,  the new facilities are helping to transform Calix’s manufacturing  capability for agriculture, marine and antimicrobial resistance  applications, as well as freeing up existing resources for other  applications across the Company, including developing Calix’s  Advanced Batteries and Zero Emissions Steel TechnologY.  Further new equipment will add significant additional testing  capacity to assess materials from prospective partners and  customers for all lines of business. The ability to test and  analyse materials on site supports rapid learning and feedback  cycles across Calix’s research programs, propelling the  development of the technology and its applications. 42  ===== PAGE 43 ===== ''The new laboratory has provided a  significant boost to the productivity of our  R&D teams. Coupled with best practice  procedures and a passionate and talented  team, the new facility is enabling us to  accelerate innovation within the company  and with our network of collaborators in  industry and academia.” Shammi Ferdousi  Materials Engineer In addition to its in-house facilities, Calix continues to  collaborate with world-class research teams across the  world, including through our partners at the Future Battery  Industries Cooperative Research Centre (CRC), Solving  Antimicrobial Resistance in Agribusiness, Food, and  Environments CRC, Heavy Industry Low-carbon Transition  CRC, the Deakin University Battery Research and Innovation  Hub, and the Deakin University Recycling and Clean Energy  Commercialisation Hub. 43  ===== PAGE 44 ===== OUR BUSINESSES 44  ===== PAGE 45 ===== Leilac exists to accelerate a just transition to net zero by providing the most compelling decarbonisation solution for global cement and lime.  Business overview Cement and lime provide the foundations of our societies and economies.  They are also amongst the largest industrial contributors to climate change,  accounting for approximately 8% of global CO2 emissions9. Leilac’s technology is purpose built to efficiently capture unavoidable process  CO2 emissions from cement and lime production, without additional chemicals  or processes. It is designed to be scalable, retrofittable, energy agnostic and  electrification ready to provide flexible and economical pathways to sustainable  industry.  Leilac’s technology is also being developed to deliver zero emissions lime for  capture of emissions from other hard-to-abate sectors, as well as Direct Air  Capture of CO2 from the atmosphere. Market trends Government policies and industry commitments continue to drive industrial  decarbonisation across the globe.  In Europe, the emissions trading scheme reached over €100 per tonne of CO2,  up from less than €20 only three years ago. A Carbon Border Adjustment  Mechanism was introduced, placing a carbon tariff on imported  carbon-intensive products, such as cement. As part of the Green Deal  Industrial Plan, the EU also introduced the Net-Zero Industry Act. The Act identifies carbon capture and storage as one of eight strategic net-zero  technologies and includes a target to develop 50 million tonnes of annual CO2  storage capacity in the EU by 2030.  In the United States, the landmark Inflation Reduction Act was passed,  representing the largest climate investment in US history. It included an increased incentive of US$85 per tonne to capture and permanently store  industrial CO2.  FY23 achievements Leilac signed its first global licence agreement in October 2022 with  Heidelberg Materials, one of the world’s largest cement companies. In an  industry first, Leilac will earn a royalty fee based on a percentage of the value  of CO2 captured by its technology. The perpetual agreement applies to any  Heidelberg Materials facility where the Leilac technology is installed.   Leilac’s growing pipeline of projects include three projects announced by  Cemex and a zero-emissions lime project with Tarmac, which passed the due  diligence phase of the UK Government’s Industrial Carbon Capture funding  scheme. In FY23, Leilac also announced a partnership with Direct Air Capture (DAC)  company, Heirloom. The partnership aims to integrate Leilac’s electric kiln  technology into Heirloom’s DAC process for removal of atmospheric CO2.  A signed Memorandum of Understanding outlines the key terms for a global  licence and collaboration agreement.  FY24 priorities  1. Complete permitting and civil works for Leilac-2. 2. Progress projects through the Leilac project pipeline. 3. Complete the Basis of Design for the green methanol  consortia project. 9Trends in global CO2 emissions; 2016 Report, The Hague: PBL Netherlands Environmental   Assessment Agency 45  ===== PAGE 46 ===== “Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) plays a major role in  decarbonizing the industry sector in the context of 1.5°C  and 2°C pathways, especially in industries with higher  process emissions, such as cement.”          SR1.5.

Like the Sustainable Development Goals (Global Goals),  Calix recognises the need to balance social, economic  and environmental sustainability. Leilac’s innovation, development and partnerships are  aligned with the Global Goals, helping to accelerate its  work to create sustainable industries and a sustainable  planet. SDG Impact 46  ===== PAGE 47 ===== Sustainable Processing Business overview Calix’s patented core platform technology aims to help mineral and chemical  processing enter the electric age. An indirect radiative heating approach separates the heat source from the chemical reaction and removes the need for combustion. Compatible with renewable sources of energy and grid-load  balancing applications, Calix’s technology is also designed to enable efficient  use of green hydrogen in place of conventional, carbon-intensive reductants. Calix’s innovative mineral processing solutions are designed to enhance  recovery of ore and create near zero-waste products. At-mine processing has  the potential to rationalise supply chains, reduce the total CO2 footprint of  minerals, and add value to mineral exports. Market trends Critical minerals essential to a decarbonising global economy were the source  of significant geopolitical interest in FY23, as governments sought to develop  sovereign capabilities and reliable supply chains. The US-Australia Climate, Critical Minerals and Clean Energy Transformation  Compact was announced. It aims to fast-track critical mineral supply chains  and provide access to US capital for Australian companies. In Europe, the  Critical Raw Materials Act also aims to diversify and enhance the resilience of  EU critical raw material supply chains. In Australia, the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund includes up to  $3 billion for renewables and low emission technologies and $1 billion for  value-adding in resources. An additional $400m was announced for Critical  Inputs for Clean Energy Industries, such as steel, cement and lime, and alumina. FY23 achievements FY23 saw considerable focus on the development of Calix’s Zero Emissions  Steel TechnologY (ZESTY). A $947,035 grant from the Australian Government’s  Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) is supporting the design of a  renewably powered direct hydrogen reduced iron (H-DRI) demonstration plant.  Initial pilot-scale testing showed excellent metallisation of a range of iron ore  types with ZESTY. The ongoing R&D program is informing a Front-End  Engineering Design (FEED) study for the 30,000 tonne per annum, zero CO2  emissions ZESTY-iron demonstration plant. In November 2022, Calix executed a joint venture with Pilbara Minerals to develop a novel mid-stream lithium processing technology to produce low carbon, low waste, and high value lithium salt. The joint venture made significant progress during FY23 on the detailed engineering and design of a  demonstration plant that aims to utilise Calix’s electric calcination technology  at Pilbara Minerals’ Pilgangoora Project. The proposed demonstration plant is  supported by a $20m grant under the Australian Government’s Modern  Manufacturing Initiative. In response to significant market demand, Calix continued to explore and develop further applications of its sustainable processing technology, including  to other critical minerals and alumina. FY24 priorities  1.	 Commence the construction of the demonstration plant at  Pilbara Minerals’ Pilgangoora project. 2.	Expand ZESTY’s ore testing program. 3.	Complete a FEED study for the ZESTY demonstration plant. 4.	Complete a pre-FEED study for Alumina.   47  ===== PAGE 48 ===== To reach the Sustainable Development Goals on climate  change and clean energy, hard-to-abate sectors of  our industry that traditionally rely on carbon intensive  heating sources and feedstocks must become compatible  with clean alternatives. Calix’s technology is energy agnostic and  electrification-ready, providing sustainable and  economical pathways for industrial processes to  transition to clean energy sources, including renewable  electricity. From electrification, to enabling green steel through  hydrogen reduction, to reducing the waste and CO2  footprint of mineral processing with innovative refining  solutions, Calix is enabling sustainable industrial  processing. SDG Impact 48  ===== PAGE 49 ===== Advanced Batteries Business overview As the global transition to electric vehicles and energy grids powered by  renewables and storage gathers pace, demand for lithium-ion battery materials  is growing. In a decarbonising global economy, advanced battery materials will  need to deliver superior performance and safety, while reducing costs and environmental impact. Calix is pioneering a renewably powered, energy efficient and low-cost  chemistry agnostic platform technology designed to produce sustainable  high-performance nanostructured battery materials. Market trends Growth in the global battery market is outpacing previous projections.  By 2030, global battery capacity is now expected to grow more than five fold to 5,500 GWh, reaching a market value of over US$400b10.  Government policies, such as the US Government’s US$369b Inflation  Reduction Act and the European Critical Minerals Act, are driving efforts to  build sovereign capabilities and supply chains. This has increased demand  for localised, high quality and sustainable battery material production.  FY23 achievements In FY23, the Advanced Batteries business successfully produced 4Ah  commercial-prototype battery cells using Calix Lithium Manganese                            Oxide (LMO) cathode powder, in collaboration with UK production partner,  AMTE Power. Additionally, Prototype Single Layer Pouch (SLP) cell testing                 demonstrated Calix LMO’s impressive high-power capabilities.  Improvements to Calix’s high-power LMO cathode materials continued,  including enhanced long-term cycling stability. Calix also continued its  productive collaboration with Deakin University, including material testing with their BatTRI-Hub pilot-scale production line and an agreement for further  testing with the Deakin Recycling and Clean Energy Commercialisation Hub  (REACH).  Informed by continuous engagement with key players in the battery market,  the high-power battery segment (for applications such as power-tools,  industrial electric vehicles, and electric 2-wheelers) was identified as a target  beachhead market.  In FY23, the Advanced Batteries business expanded its cathode production  portfolio to include additional battery chemistries. Early lab-scale results show  successful production of Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) and Lithium Nickel  Manganese Oxide (LNMO) cathode materials. The production of new battery  chemistries may open opportunities in larger segments of the battery market  and demonstrate the potential of Calix’s production methods as a more  sustainable and low-cost chemistry agnostic platform technology.   FY24 priorities  1. Include Calix’s battery module in a consumer product format. 2.	Complete the FEED for a demonstration facility for cathode  production. 3.	Develop a commercial format cell with a new Calix electrode  chemistry. 10Global lithium-ion battery capacity to rise five-fold by 2030 49  ===== PAGE 50 ===== Batteries are an essential enabling technology for our  clean energy future, decarbonising transport and  stabilising renewably powered energy grids. The ongoing, rapid growth of the global battery market  makes finding more economical and sustainable  production methods increasingly important to meeting  the Sustainable Development Goals. Calix’s low-cost, simple and safe battery chemistry  shows significant promise, potentially enabling improved  efficiencies, and a reduction in cost and environmental  footprint of energy storage options. SDG Impact 50  ===== PAGE 51 ===== Biotech Business overview Calix’s Biotech business is developing high surface area magnesium oxide  materials with unique bioactive properties for three target applications: Agriculture Reducing dependence on lethal chemical pesticides is an important  challenge for the agriculture industry. Calix BOOSTER-Mag is a safe, low-cost  and environmentally sustainable alternative to conventional insecticides.  Now registered in Australia, BOOSTER-Mag provides non-lethal pest  suppression, designed to enable reduced use of conventional insecticide               without compromising yield or yield quality. Marine Marine biofouling increases hull surface roughness, fuel consumption and  greenhouse gas emissions. Conventional anti-foul paints and coatings are  toxic and have well documented negative effects on the marine environment.  To deliver more sustainable marine-fouling and corrosion control, Calix is  developing non-toxic bioactive additives that aim to enable a material reduction  in the use of toxic biocides. Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Following many years of overuse and the development of resistance, reducing reliance on conventional pesticides, biocides and antibiotics is urgently needed. The antimicrobial properties of Calix’s unique bioactive  materials, with low resistance development potential, offer a promising  sustainable alternative to conventional actives.   Market trends Agriculture: non-conventional pesticides, that is, biologicals, are predicted to  grow at 15% p.a. for the next 10 years,11 largely driven by the ongoing  prohibition of many conventional pesticides.   Marine: with increasing focus on emissions from shipping, the International  Maritime Organisation has adopted a new emissions reduction strategy12 and is strengthening biofouling measures13.  Antimicrobial Resistance: AMR is internationally recognised as a global  crisis, projected to cost the global economy US$100 trillion and cause 10 million  deaths per year by 205014.   FY23 achievements Agriculture: Calix continued to develop a non-lethal insecticide                             alternative product for potential introduction to the Australian market.                Additional field trials are underway that aim to extend the label of Calix’s                current BOOSTER-Mag registration. A second season of field trials is underway  in Europe.  Marine: Calix successfully completed phase 2 static tests with leading global  coatings firms. Following this success, ongoing dynamic tests and coatings  formulation work is underway in different marine antifouling sites across North  America, Australia / NZ and Asia.  Antimicrobial Resistance: in FY23, Calix became a Tier 1 partner in Australia’s  Cooperative Research Centre Solving Antimicrobial Resistance in Agribusiness,  Food, and Environments (CRC SAAFE). Calix’s novel materials will be used for  investigating new AMR solutions in agriculture, including health and food  applications. The first project is underway and will study the application of  Calix bioactive materials in intensive livestock.  FY24 priorities  Continue to develop and commercialise Calix’s core technology  for applications in agriculture, marine and antimicrobial  resistance. 51  ===== PAGE 52 ===== The current use of particular products in agriculture,  shipping and pharmaceutical industries damages  ecosystems on land and below water, threatening  biological diversity and risking future outbreaks of  infectious diseases. To reach the Sustainable  Development Goals, solutions that enable the  sustainable use of our land and oceans are needed. Calix’s magnesium oxide based materials are non-toxic  and exhibit unique bioactive properties. Their continued  development offers multiple potential applications that  can replace polluting or damaging products in  agriculture and marine coatings, and help address  the rise of antimicrobial resistance.

Calix’s ALKA-Mag+, AQUA-Cal+ and ACTI-Mag provide safe, effective,                economical and sustainable solutions for the treatment of water and  wastewater.  Market trends In North America, regulatory tailwinds continue to drive growth in the  magnesium hydroxide market. For wastewater, increased regulation regarding nitrogen removal is creating  demand for solutions that boost alkalinity and maintain effective  microorganism activity.  For the potable water market, strengthened regulation on residual lead and  copper requires alternative pH control solutions to minimise the corrosivity  of water within the distribution system. FY23 achievements In FY23, the development of ALKA-Mag+ has helped to secure new business  within existing hydration plant regions in the Pacific Northwest and Upper Midwest of the US.     Revenue growth of 14.2% coupled with strong margins led to a gross profit  increase of 28.6%. Revenue growth accelerated during the year, with growth in  the second half of FY23 up 28% compared with the same period in FY22.   Throughout the financial period, efforts were made to progress the building of  two new hydration plants in Ripon, Wisconsin and Lufkin, Texas. Both plants are  planning to commence operations by the end of the 2023 calendar year.  The new plants will support sales in new regions, including Wisconsin, Illinois  and Texas.   Finally, the Water business has solidified relationships with two new distributors  in the wastewater treatment market, and another in the potable water  treatment market. The three distributors share a philosophy of providing world  class products, service and technical credibility. FY24 priorities  Deliver continued growth in the US and Asia. 53  ===== PAGE 54 ===== Water sits at the heart of sustainable development.

Collectively, they will help to create value for  industry, our shareholders and the planet, as we strive to solve some of  humanity’s greatest global challenges.  66  ===== PAGE 67 ===== The directors present their report on Calix Limited and its controlled entities (“the Group” or “Calix”) consisting of  Calix Limited (“the Company”) and entities under its control as of, or during the year ended, 30 June 2023.  DIRECTORS  The following persons were directors of the Company during the whole of the year ended 30 June 2023 and up to  the date of the report, unless otherwise stated:  •  Peter Turnbull, AM  •  Alison Deans (appointed 1 March 2023)  •  Helen Fisher  •  Dr Jack Hamilton (retired 8 March 2023)  •  Dr Phil Hodgson  •  Dr Mark Sceats  PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES   Calix is an environmental technology company solving global challenges in industrial decarbonisation and  sustainability, including CO2 mitigation, sustainable minerals processing, advanced batteries, biotechnology and  water treatment. Calix’s patented core platform technology delivers efficient indirect heating of raw materials to  enable electrification of industries, capture of unavoidable emissions, and green industrial processing solutions. Its  flash heating approach can also produce nano-porous materials with enhanced chemical and/or  bioactivity. Leveraging its core platform technology and a global network of research and development  collaborations, Calix is developing multiple environmental businesses that deliver positive global impact.  The core platform technology– the Calix Flash Calciner (“CFC”) – is a reinvention of the kiln process that has three  core benefits:  1.  Enabling electrification and green industrial processing  Calix’s patented core platform technology is designed to help mineral and chemical processing enter the  electric age. Its indirect heating approach is compatible with renewable sources of energy and alternative fuels.  Separating the heat source from the chemical reaction may also enable the most efficient use of green  hydrogen in place of conventional, carbon intensive reducing agents.  Additionally, Calix is developing refining solutions that enhance recovery of ore and create near zero-waste  products. Renewably powered at-mine processing has the potential to enable value creation and capture  through refined, low-carbon mineral products.  2.  Enabling efficient capture of unavoidable emissions  For industries such as cement and lime, a majority of their CO2 emissions are process emissions, produced  as a direct and unavoidable result of the decomposition of limestone to lime. With no additional chemicals or  processes, Calix’s technology is being developed to efficiently separate process CO2 for use or storage to  deliver low-cost abatement of unavoidable emissions.  3.  Production of highly active materials  Calix's flash heating approach can produce nano-porous materials with enhanced chemical and/or bioactivity.  These highly active materials can be made into safe, sustainable and effective products for water and  wastewater treatment, agriculture, marine and antimicrobial resistance, and are also being developed for  advanced lithium-ion batteries.  The Group has operations, customers and distribution partners across Australia, New Zealand, Asia, Europe and  the United States of America (“US”). Its activities in the 2023 Financial Year (“FY23”) were focused across five  business segments, being: Leilac (a CO2 mitigation business), Sustainable Processing, Advanced Batteries,  Biotech and Water. These “lines of business” are supported by Research & Development (“R&D”), engineering,  operations, marketing, and finance and administration teams.

The key current development areas are:   •  demonstration and commercialisation of the technology for the cement and lime industries;   •  application of the technology in sustainable processing, including green iron and steel, and for critical  minerals, such as lithium; and   •  application of the technology for advanced battery and bioactive materials.   These activities are supported by the Group’s R&D facilities in Australia, as well as engineering groups in Australia  and Europe.            CALIX’S CORE PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY 68  ===== PAGE 69 ===== Our business activities are underpinned by:   •  a commercial-scale operations facility at Bacchus Marsh in Victoria, with a name-plate capacity of 25,000  tonnes per year of raw (magnesium oxide) product;   •  a raw material (magnesium carbonate) mine near Leigh Creek in South Australia;   •  a pilot demonstration facility for CO2 capture from lime and cement (“Leilac-1” facility) in Lixhe, Belgium;   •  an electric calciner for sustainable processing development and the production of advanced materials,  including battery materials (“BATMn” facility) at Bacchus Marsh; and   •  four manufacturing facilities in the US to produce water treatment products to serve North American  customers, with a fifth undergoing commissioning and a sixth under construction.  OPERATING RESULTS  In FY23, total revenue and other income increased by 42% to $29.6m (FY22: $20.8m), including a sales gross  margin of 33% (FY22: 28%), with continued revenue and margin contribution in the US and Asia Pacific from the  Water line of business. A strong balance sheet and cash position of $74.5m (FY22: $25.0m) is underpinned by a  $60.0m institutional placement in October 2022 and a $21.6m Share Purchase Plan completed in November 2022.   The Company undertook investment of $31.7m (FY22: $19.7m) in capability and capacity building to commercialise  Calix’s platform technology, particularly in the CO2 Mitigation and Sustainable Processing lines of business. This  includes investment in additional research, development and engineering, which accounted for 77% of the total  increase in operational expenditure. Calix concluded FY23 with 129 full-time employees (FY22: 72 full-time  employees), which includes 37 new engineers and scientists to support R&D, as well as new employees to support  customer projects.  FINANCIAL POSITION  The Group held $74.5m in cash and cash equivalents at 30 June 2023 (30 June 2022: $25.0m) and had a surplus  of $68.2m of total current assets over total current liabilities (30 June 2022: $16.5m). Calix’s strong balance sheet,  including its cash position and minimal debt, provides the capacity to simultaneously pursue commercialisation  opportunities in large addressable markets across the Company’s multiple lines of business.    MARKET CONDITIONS  Despite a challenging global economic environment – with volatile markets continuing to deal with the persistent  effects of inflation, supply chain constraints and the war in Ukraine – Environmental, Social and Governance  (“ESG”) tailwinds continue to gather strength. Commitment to and investment in solutions that align with ESG  goals continues to grow year-on-year as governments, industries and investors look to achieve their  decarbonisation goals and meet their net-zero commitments.   In FY23, various policies to drive decarbonisation were announced around the world, including:   •  a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism and Net-Zero Industry Act in Europe;   •  the Inflation Reduction Act and Regional Direct Air Capture hubs in the USA; and   •  Safeguard Mechanism, Powering the Regions Fund, National Reconstruction Fund, and Critical  Minerals Strategy in Australia.   These policies recognise the need for urgent, affordable and scalable solutions that balance social, economic  and environmental sustainability to solve some of the greatest global challenges of our time.   REVIEW OF OPERATIONS  As planned, the Group invested in people, capital and services in FY23, helping to fuel activity in R&D and  commercialisation. The investment costs in people and technology development – specifically R&D and  engineering capability – were partly offset with $10.7m in FY23 in grants and tax rebates from governments in the  various jurisdictions in which Calix operates.       69  ===== PAGE 70 ===== Operational highlights since 1 July 2022, include:   Leilac  •  First licence agreement signed for cement: Leilac, Calix’s 93% owned subsidiary focused on the  decarbonisation of cement and lime, signed a first-of-a-kind perpetual global licence agreement with  Heidelberg Materials (FWB: HEI).   •  The Leilac-2 project progressed: the Leilac-2 project located at Heidelberg Materials’ Hanover site  commenced procurement of long-lead items and site works (demolition of old existing infrastructure) following  some permitting delays. This will likely push commissioning into 2025. Leilac-2 is targeting 100,000 tonnes  per annum of CO2 separation and aims to establish a modular, retrofittable format of the Leilac technology for  cement applications.  •  Leilac executed non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) outlining the key terms for a  global licence agreement with Heirloom for Direct Air Capture: Leilac announced a new application of its  core kiln technology for Direct Air Capture (“DAC”) of atmospheric CO2, and a non-binding MOU for a global  licence and collaboration agreement with Heirloom.  •  Leilac and CEMEX announced new projects: Three full-scale decarbonisation projects were announced by  Leilac and CEMEX S.A.B. de C.V. (NYSE: CX) in Germany, Poland and the US. Progress was also made  towards a global licence agreement with CEMEX.   •  Calix was announced as a partner in methanol project for sustainable fuels from CO2: With funding from  the German-Australian Hydrogen Innovation and Technology Incubator (“HyGATE”) initiative, the Solar  Methanol Project aims to use renewable energy, green hydrogen and CO2 captured by the Leilac technology  to produce sustainable fuels.     Sustainable Processing  •  Joint venture executed with Pilbara Minerals (ASX: PLS): Supported by a grant of $20m under the  Australian Government’s Modern Manufacturing Initiative (“MMI”), Calix’s joint venture with Pilbara Minerals  aims to develop novel mid-stream lithium processing to produce low carbon, low waste, and high value  concentrated lithium salt.   •  Sustainable lithium demonstration plant progressed towards construction: Detailed Front-End  Engineering and Design (“FEED”) of a mid-stream spodumene processing demonstration plant, developed in  a joint venture with Pilbara Minerals, progressed towards a Financial Investment Decision (“FID”).  •  Calix awarded funding for Zero Emissions Steel Technology (“ZESTY”): A $0.947m Australian  Renewable Energy Agency (“ARENA”) grant was awarded to Calix to help fund a Basis of Design (“BOD”) and  FEED study for a renewably powered 30,000 tonnes per annum (“tpa”) demonstration plant.   •  First stage ZESTY pilot-scale tests: Pilot-scale metallisation results show ZESTY can produce H-DRI  products from multiple ore samples. The results will inform and progress design of a ZESTY demonstration  plant.   Advanced Batteries  •  Commercial-prototype LMO battery cells produced: Calix produced 4Ah commercial-prototype battery  cells using Calix Lithium Manganese Oxide (“LMO”) cathode powder, in collaboration with UK production  partner, AMTE Power.  •  Expanded to new battery chemistries: Calix expanded its battery materials capability to new chemistries,  including those favoured by the electric vehicle segment of the battery market.

A first project  focused on AMR in intensive livestock commenced.         70  ===== PAGE 71 ===== Water  •  Continued product development and revenue growth: the development of a new product, ALKA-Mag+  helped to secure new business and grow revenue within existing hydration plant regions in the Pacific  Northwest and Upper Midwest of the USA.    •  New hydration plants progressed: New hydration plants in Ripon, Wisconsin, and Lufkin, Texas, were  advanced. The Lufkin plant is undergoing commissioning, and the Ripon plant is under construction.        CO2 Mitigation   Leilac’s purpose is to accelerate the transition to net zero by providing a compelling decarbonisation solution for  global cement and lime.   Cement and lime provide the foundations of our societies and economies. They are also amongst the largest  industrial contributors to climate change, accounting for approximately 8% of global CO2 emissions. Leilac’s  technology enables the capture of unavoidable process CO2 emissions from cement and lime production, without  additional chemicals or processes. It is being designed to be scalable, retrofittable, energy agnostic and  electrification ready to provide flexible and economical pathways to carbon neutral cement and lime. Leilac’s  technology is also being developed to deliver zero emissions lime for capture of emissions from other hard-to-abate  sectors, as well as Direct Air Capture of CO2 from the atmosphere.   Government policies and industry commitments continue to drive industrial decarbonisation across the globe. In  Europe, the emissions trading scheme reached over €100 per tonne of CO2, up from less than €20 only three years  ago. A Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism was introduced, placing a carbon tariff on imported carbon-intensive  products, such as cement. As part of the Green Deal Industrial Plan, the EU also introduced the Net-Zero Industry  Act. This Act identifies carbon capture and storage as one of eight strategic net-zero technologies and includes a  target to develop 50 million tonnes of annual CO2 storage capacity in the EU by 2030. In the United States, the  Inflation Reduction Act was passed. It included an increased incentive of US$85 per tonne to capture and  permanently store industrial CO2.    Leilac signed its first global licence agreement in October 2022. In an industry first, Leilac’s royalty fee will be based  on a percentage of the value of CO2 captured by its technology. The perpetual agreement applies to any Heidelberg  Materials facility where the Leilac technology is installed. The Leilac-2 Project at Heidelberg Materials’ Hanover  site commenced procurement of long-lead items and site works (demolition of old existing infrastructure) following  some permitting delays. This will likely push commissioning into 2025. Leilac-2 is targeting 100,000 tonnes per  annum of CO2 separation and aims to establish a modular, retrofittable format of the Leilac technology for cement  applications. Leilac’s pipeline of projects continued to grow, including the announced three projects with Cemex,  and a zero-emissions lime project with Tarmac which passed the due diligence phase of the UK Government’s  Industrial Carbon Capture funding scheme. In FY23, Leilac also announced a partnership with a DAC company,  Heirloom. The partnership aims to integrate Leilac’s electric kiln technology into Heirloom’s DAC process for  removal of atmospheric CO2. A signed MoU outlines the key terms for a global licence and collaboration agreement.                     71  ===== PAGE 72 =====     Sustainable Processing  Calix’s patented core platform technology aims to help mineral and chemical processing enter the electric age. An  indirect radiative heating approach separates the heat source from the chemical reaction and removes the need  for combustion. Compatible with renewable sources of energy and grid-load balancing applications, Calix’s  technology is also being designed to enable efficient use of green hydrogen in place of conventional, carbon- intensive reductants, enhance recovery of ore, and create near zero-waste products. At-mine processing has the  potential to rationalise supply chains, reduce the total CO2 footprint of minerals, and add value to mineral exports.   Critical minerals were the source of significant geopolitical interest in FY23, as governments sought to develop  reliable supply chains for minerals of strategic importance in a decarbonising global economy. The US-Australia  Climate, Critical Minerals and Clean Energy Transformation Compact was announced. It aims to fast-track critical  mineral supply chains and provide access to US capital for Australian companies. In Europe, the Critical Raw  Materials Act also aims to diversify and enhance the resilience of EU critical raw material supply chains. In Australia,  the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund includes up to $3 billion for renewables and low emission technologies  and $1 billion for value-adding in resources. An additional $400m was announced for Critical Inputs for Clean  Energy Industries, such as steel, cement and lime, and alumina.   FY23 saw considerable focus on the development of Calix’s ZESTY. A $947,035 grant from the Australian  Government’s ARENA is supporting the design of a renewably powered direct hydrogen reduced iron (“H-DRI”)  demonstration plant. Initial pilot-scale testing showed metallisation of a range of iron ore types with ZESTY.   In November 2022, Calix executed a joint venture agreement with Pilbara Minerals to develop a novel mid-stream  lithium processing technology to produce low carbon, low waste, and high value lithium salt. In FY23, the joint  venture progressed detailed engineering and design of a demonstration plant that aims to utilise Calix’s electric  calcination technology at Pilbara Minerals’ Pilgangoora Project. The proposed demonstration plant is supported by  a $20m grant under the Australian Government’s MMI. A FID for the demonstration plant was approved by the  boards of Calix and Pilbara Minerals on 2 August 2023.   In FY23, Calix also continued to explore and develop further applications of its sustainable processing technology,  including to alumina and other critical minerals.           Advanced Batteries  Calix is developing a renewably powered, energy efficient and low-cost chemistry-agnostic platform technology  targeting production of high-performance nanostructured battery materials.   Demand for lithium-ion battery materials is growing, driven by a transition towards electric vehicles and renewably  powered energy grids supported by battery storage. By 2030, global battery capacity is expected to grow more  than five-fold to 5,500 GWh, reaching an estimated total addressable market of over US$400b.1 Government  policies, such as the US Government’s US$369b Inflation Reduction Act and the European Critical Minerals Act,  are driving efforts to build sovereign capabilities and supply chains. This has increased demand for localised, high  quality and sustainable battery material production.   In FY23, the Advanced Batteries business progressed the development of commercial-prototype battery cells, in  collaboration with UK production partner, AMTE Power, and prototype single layer pouch cells. Calix also continued  its collaboration with Deakin University and expanded its cathode production portfolio to include additional battery  chemistries. Early lab-scale results showed successful production of Lithium Iron Phosphate (“LFP”) and Lithium  Nickel Manganese Oxide (“LNMO”) cathode materials. The production of new battery chemistries aims to  demonstrate the potential of Calix’s production methods as a chemistry-agnostic platform technology.       1 Global lithium-ion battery capacity to rise five-fold by 2030  72  ===== PAGE 73 =====     Biotech  Calix’s Biotech business continued to develop magnesium oxide materials with high bioactivity for three target  applications:   Agriculture   Reducing dependence on lethal chemical pesticides is an important challenge for the agriculture industry. Calix  BOOSTER-Mag is a safe, low-cost, and environmentally sustainable alternative insecticide now registered in  Australia. BOOSTER-Mag provides non-lethal pest suppression that aims to enable reduced use of conventional  insecticide without compromising yield or yield quality. Non-conventional pesticides are predicted to grow at 15%  per annum for the next 10 years2, driven in part by the prohibition of many conventional pesticides. In FY23, in  collaboration with an EU agricultural cooperative, a second season of extended field trials commenced in the  Netherlands, following the banning of the fungicide Mancozeb in the EU. Additional field trials also commenced to  extend the label of Calix’s current BOOSTER-Mag registration.   Marine   Marine biofouling increases hull surface roughness, fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.  Conventional anti-foul paints and coatings are toxic and have well documented negative effects on the marine  environment. In FY23, the International Maritime Organisation adopted a new emissions reduction strategy3 and  indicated it will strengthen biofouling measures4. Calix is developing non-toxic bioactive additives that aim to deliver  more sustainable marine-fouling and corrosion control through a material reduction in the use of toxic biocides. In  FY23, Calix completed phase two static tests with leading global coatings firms. Dynamic tests and coatings  formulation work commenced in different marine antifouling sites across North America, Australia, New Zealand  and Asia.    Antimicrobial Resistance   Following many years of overuse of conventional pesticides, biocides and antibiotics, AMR is projected to cost the  global economy US$100 trillion and cause 10 million deaths per year by 2050.5 The antimicrobial properties of  Calix’s bioactive materials, with low resistance development potential, may offer a sustainable alternative to  conventional actives. In FY23, Calix became a Tier 1 partner in Australia’s CRC SAAFE. A first project with CRC  SAAFE has commenced, studying the application of Calix bioactive materials in improving health in intensive  livestock.          Water  Water and wastewater management is a challenge that can threaten vital waterways, impacting health and the  environment. Effective management of water and wastewater helps to protect freshwater systems, oceans and  human health by preventing detrimental pathogens, nutrients and other types of pollution from entering the  environment. Calix’s products aim to provide safe, effective, economical and sustainable solutions for the treatment  of water and wastewater.   In North America, regulatory tailwinds continued to drive growth in the magnesium hydroxide market. For  wastewater, increased regulation regarding nitrogen removal created demand for solutions that boost alkalinity and  maintain effective microorganism activity. For the potable water market, strengthened regulation on residual lead    2 Insightace analytic  3 2023 IMO Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships  4 Draft revised Biofouling Guidelines approved at PPR 10th session  5 United Nations Environment Programme (2022).

In FY23, Calix’s Water business identified and secured new sales within its existing hydration plant regions in the  Pacific Northwest and Upper Midwest of the United States. The US Water business recorded revenue growth for  the full year of 14.2%, while strong margins led to a gross profit increase of 28.6%. Revenue growth accelerated  during the year, with growth in the second half of FY23 up 28% compared with the same period in FY22. Throughout  the financial year, the construction of two new hydration plants in Ripon, Wisconsin, and Lufkin, Texas, progressed.  The Lufkin plant is undergoing commissioning, and the Ripon plant is under construction.    FUTURE DEVELOPMENT, PROSPECTS AND BUSINESS STRATEGIES  The Group will continue to pursue the following strategies and activities as it works towards achieving its 2024  Financial Year (“FY24”) priorities.   In FY24, Calix will continue to focus on accelerating the development and commercialisation of its technologies for  industrial decarbonisation, including electrification of industrial processing and capture of process CO2 emissions.  Priorities include the progression of projects through engineering milestones, including the commencement of civil  works for Leilac-2 and construction of the mid-stream lithium-phosphate demonstration plant at Pilbara Minerals’  Pilgangoora project. Calix will also continue to develop its core platform technology for application to alumina  refining and the production of cathode active materials for lithium-ion batteries.  In FY24, Calix plans to combine its Water and Biotech businesses into a new Magnesia line of business. This  change is designed to increase the scale and reach of Calix’s magnesium-based products. The Magnesia business  will focus on delivering revenue growth for the Group through increased sales of water treatment products in the  US and Asia. In addition, it will focus on the development and commercialisation of applications for agriculture,  marine and antimicrobial resistance, and sustainable processing of magnesium metal.     Calix continues its strategy to leverage the Group’s core platform technology for applications it believes can create  shared value and economic growth, and can support sustainable competitive advantages. Calix will pursue low  touch business models, including the conversion of existing relationships to licence agreements to assist the  Company achieve its objectives.      GOING CONCERN  The financial report has been prepared on a going concern basis.  SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE STATE OF AFFAIRS  Other than the milestones set out in the review of operations and the capital raise noted above, there were no  significant changes in the state of affairs of the Group during the year.  DIVIDENDS   No dividends were paid or were payable during the year (2023: $NIL).  AFTER BALANCE DATE EVENTS  On 2 August, 2023, the Group announced that the joint venture project with Pilbara Minerals Limited (ASX:PLS)  to construct a ~3000 tonne per annum lithium phosphate production facility had passed its FID.

P J Turnbull AM   Chair  Calix Limited  Sydney, Australia    24 August 2023  79  ===== PAGE 80 ===== Remuneration report (Audited)   Introduction    This remuneration report sets out the remuneration information for directors of Calix Limited and its controlled  entities (“the Group” or “Calix”) consisting of Calix Limited (“the Company”) and entities under its control, and other  Key Management Personnel (“KMP”). For the purposes of this report, KMP of the Group is defined as those persons  having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling major activities of the Company and the  Group, directly or indirectly, including any director of the Company.    The key objectives of the Group’s remuneration policies are to align Calix’s directors, KMP and employees,  including KMP, with shareholders’ interests, while ensuring remuneration structures are fair and competitive. The  policies, including an Employee Incentive Scheme (“EIS”), seek to balance incentives to achieve annual short-term  goals with incentives to create and execute opportunities that build long-term shareholder value. The employee  incentive scheme, in particular, is designed to balance these goals by providing employees with ‘at risk’ rewards  for their performance. Subject to performance requirements being met, employees receive awards that vest over  a period of six years. Since the inception of the employee incentive scheme in 2018 when the Company was listed  on the Australian Securities Exchange (“ASX”), the Company’s value has grown significantly.     The directors believe the current remuneration policies are appropriate and effective to attract, retain and motivate  the KMP needed to run and manage the Group. The directors’ policies for determining the nature and amount of  remuneration for directors and KMP of the Group follow:    Non-executive director remuneration  •  Non-executive directors’ remuneration is approved by the Board of Directors (“the Board”) and shareholders.  Remuneration is reviewed annually, based on market practice, duties and accountability. Independent  external advice is sought when required. The maximum aggregate of fees that can be paid to non-executive  directors is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”).  •  At the AGM of shareholders in 2022, a resolution to increase the non-executive director fee pool was carried.  The increase is helping to ensure:  o  Board composition – the Board maintains a proactive and careful process of board renewal to  ensure the size and composition of the Board is appropriate to support the continued delivery of  the Group’s growth strategies.  o  Board size – given Calix’s growth trajectory, and the breadth of commercial options and  pathways available in the future, it is anticipated that additional directors with the requisite skills  and experience to further support the Group’s growth strategies will be required.  o  Board fee competitiveness – the increase in the fee pool provides the Board with the ability to  appoint and remunerate non-executive directors at a level commensurate with current market  rates and, as necessary, enable Calix to attract and retain new directors of the highest calibre.  o  Alignment with peers – the level of non-executive directors’ remuneration is reviewed annually  to ensure alignment with the market. Benchmarking of ASX companies of a similar size,  profitability, and growth and risk profile confirmed that the increased fee pool is in line with similar  companies within Calix’s broad market sector. The previous fee pool increase was in 2011.    Non-executive directors   The following people were non-executive directors of the Group during the 2023 financial year (“FY23”) and,  unless otherwise indicated, were classified as non-executive directors for the entire year.  •  Peter Turnbull, AM, Independent Chair  •  Helen Fisher, Independent Director  •  Dr Jack Hamilton, Independent Director (retired 8 March 2023)  •  Alison Deans, Independent Director (appointed 1 March 2023)      80  ===== PAGE 81 ===== KMP salary and retirement benefits  •  All KMP, including the CEO, receive a base salary, which is based on factors such as experience, skills and  competencies. The Board reviews KMP base salary levels annually by reference to the Group’s performance,  individual performance and comparable information from industry sectors.  •  All Australian-based KMP employees also receive a superannuation guarantee contribution, which for FY23  was 10.5% (10.0% for FY22) up to the concessional contributions cap, and do not receive any other retirement  benefits.    Employee incentives  •  An EIS is applied based upon performance of both the Group and individual Key Performance Indicators  (“KPI”). The Board sets yearly KPIs for the Group to drive performance, appropriately balancing current and  future value creation, and reflecting the nature and strategy of the Group. The actual performance against  KPIs is reviewed regularly and assessed at the end of the financial year by the People and Culture Committee,  for the purpose of determining EIS outcomes.  •  The EIS is a hybrid share-based scheme that combines both short-term and long-term incentives. It is  designed to retain and motivate Calix’s employees, building alignment of employees’ interests with  shareholders’ interests to deliver shareholder value, consistent with the nature and strategy of the Group.   •  Typically, no cash-based bonuses are provided to management and staff. Cash-based bonuses are only  available if there is significant outperformance achieved in Group KPIs, as well as positive earnings before  interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”), that is, if the Group generates significant cash  earnings.

Minimum shareholding requirements   The Company’s Minimum Shareholding Policy for Directors stipulates that all directors of Calix should have and  maintain a shareholding in Calix (directly or indirectly) that meets or exceeds the following minimum values, which  are calculated using the share price at the time of purchase:  •  25% of the director’s year 1 base director fee (after tax) – 1 year after their initial appointment; and  •  50% of the director’s year 1 base director fee (after tax) – within 2 years after their initial appointment.   The Minimum Shareholding Policy for Directors is available on the Company’s website.     As outlined in the table above, the current shareholding of directors exceeds the minimum requirements stipulated  in the minimum shareholding policy.

Calix’s success into the future will be based on its ability to commercialise its intellectual  property assets and to continue to innovate and find new ways to apply its capability. To this end, team members  need to strike the right balance between achieving annual short-term goals whilst also working towards new  opportunities to build shareholder value by leveraging the Calix’s technology. Calix’s ‘at-risk’ EIS is designed to  balance these objectives, providing rewards for performance in the current year that accrue over the medium to  longer term.      Background  On 18 April 2018, at an extraordinary general meeting, the shareholders of Calix approved a new EIS to operate  once the Company was listed. The Calix Officers & Employees Incentive Scheme (“EIS”) provides for the grant of  rights and/or options to eligible officers and employees (as determined by the Board) and is intended to provide  competitive, performance-based remuneration supporting retention, incentive and reward, and alignment with  shareholders. Non-executive and independent directors are not invited to participate in the EIS.    Key terms of the EIS are published on the ASX and the scheme is summarised below:    Overview of the EIS   The EIS is a hybrid scheme that provides both short-term and long-term incentive to all employees, including KMP  – aligning employees’ remuneration and interests with shareholders’ interests. For KMP and senior executives,  each round of the scheme operates over a six-year period, with a maximum option pool approved by the Board in  year zero, the first tranche of awards vesting at the end of year one, and the final tranche of awards vesting on the  sixth anniversary of the initial option award.     The EIS for KMP and senior executives is delivered by zero priced options. Performance-vesting of the allocated  options is subject to a series of three performance gateways assessed in each year of the three-year performance  period. At the end of a three-year performance period, options which did not meet annual performance gates are  subjected to further performance testing based on criteria for superior Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”)  performance. All Performance-vested options are then subject to tenure-based vesting over a three-year period.  84  ===== PAGE 85 ===== Details and worked examples of the performance criteria and vesting schedules over the six-year period are  provided below.    The first round of the EIS was made available to all Calix employees, including KMP (and excluding non-executive  directors), at the end of 2018 with an ability to earn parcels of share-based incentives over the proceeding five- year period to 30 June 2023. The scheme was extended in 2022 with an additional round made available with the  ability to earn parcels of share-based incentives over the proceeding five-year period to 30 June 2026. Additional  rounds of the scheme will typically be made available every three years.    The Board typically limits the number of shares over which options or rights will be issued under the EIS to 2% of  the total number of shares on issue (i.e. undiluted) in any one year. Subject to any limitations that might apply  under the Corporations Act 2001 or limits under ASIC class order relief, there is no limit on the number of rights  and/or options that may be issued under the EIS. The actual percentage of rights on issue will fluctuate as a result  of changes in staffing levels.     Individual incentives and performance criteria for KMP and Senior Executives  The maximum potential award under the EIS for each executive is based on a percentage of gross salary, with the  proportion of total remuneration ‘at risk’ increasing with executive responsibility. The maximum potential award per  year for senior executives is 40% of their gross salary, 50% for the Chief Science Officer and Chief Financial  Officer, and 65% for the Chief Executive Officer.     The actual award each year is determined as a percentage of maximum potential award, based on the three  performance gateways detailed below (performance vesting). The actual award from each year then vests over the  subsequent three-year period with one third of the actual award vesting immediately and one third at the end of  each subsequent year (tenure vesting).    In an illustrative example – a senior executive is allocated a maximum possible 90,000 options under the EIS at  the start of the scheme, reflecting 120% (40% x 3) of the executive’s gross salary. Assuming a salary of $225,000  this results in an allocation of $270,000. Assuming $3 per Calix ordinary share at the commencement of the scheme  this results in an allocation of 90,000 zero priced options at the start of the scheme. At the end of each of the first  three years of the scheme, the maximum potential award is 30,000 options, with the actual award being subject to  three performance gateways (performance vesting). The actual award for each year, then vests subject to tenure,  with one third able to vest immediately, and the remaining two thirds vesting in equal tranches over the next two  years (tenure vesting).     Performance Gateways  Three Performance Gateways are used to determine performance-vesting in each year and are applied  sequentially:    Gateway 1 – SHEQ performance  Gateway 1 is achieving the Company’s Safety, Health, Environment, and Quality Action Plan KPIs as agreed with  the Board each year. If the Safety Health, Environment, and Quality Action Plan KPIs are not met, then no rights  or options can be awarded for performance that year. This Performance Gateway is designed to ensure that Safety,  Health and Environmental performance of our team members and Quality of our products and services remain  paramount at all times. The Action Plan reflects International Standard ISO45001, against which the Company is  audited annually.    Gateway 2 – Share price performance  Gateway 2 assesses absolute share price performance over the year as measured by TSR, as described below.  TSR is measured as Calix’s share price performance, being the 30-day Volume-Weighted Average Price (“VWAP”)  over the 15 days preceding, and the 15 days after, June 30 in the prior financial year (“Baseline TSR”) as compared  with the 30-day VWAP over the 15 days preceding and the 15 days after 30 June in the current financial year  (“Measured TSR”). If the Measured TSR for a particular financial year is not higher than the Baseline TSR for that  85  ===== PAGE 86 ===== period of measurement, any options or rights earned under Performance Gateway 3 (as described below) remain  unvested. However, such unvested options or rights may vest if at any time before the end of the financial year  immediately after the full vesting period, the 30-day VWAP for Calix’s shares exceeds the applicable Baseline TSR  for those unvested rights. This mechanism is designed to ensure that shorter-term goals or advances do not  dominate over more significant, longer-term value creation opportunities, so that KMP continue to balance shorter  term outcomes with a longer-term view of outcomes for a multi-year, multi-application value opportunity.    Gateway 3 – Performance against KPIs  Gateway 3 measures Company and executive performance against KPIs agreed each year with the Board. These  KPIs reflect the corporate milestone targets set for each line of business, and are communicated to the market in  the Company’s Remuneration Report, full year and half year financial reports, in addition to the Company’s annual  report and AGM. Gateway 3 helps to drive achievement of annual performance metrics that balance both short- term and long-term shareholder value creation.      The EIS rights or zero priced options that have passed through all three gateways will be classed as “Performance- vested”. These options will then be subject to tenure-based vesting with one third vesting immediately. The other  two thirds will then vest in two equal traches at the end of each of the two full financial years following the  Performance year, provided the KMP or senior executive remains a full-time employee of the Company.     To continue the illustrative example above:  1.  In year 1, a KPI result of 7/10 was achieved, meaning 21,000 options have Performance-vested for the  senior executive above. Of these 21,000 options, one third is immediately Tenure-vested, while the  remaining 14,000 options vest in equal tranches at one year and two years after the performance year,  provided the senior executive is still with the Company.  2.  In year 2, a KPI result of 6/10 was achieved, meaning 18,000 options have Performance-vested. Of these  18,000 options, one third is immediately Tenure-vested, while the remaining 12,000 options vest in equal  tranches at one year and two years after the performance year, provided the senior executive is still with  the Company.  3.  In year 3, a KPI result of 9/10 was achieved, meaning 27,000 options have Performance-vested. Of these  27,000 options, one third is immediately Tenure-vested, while the remaining 18,000 options vest in equal  tranches at one year and two years after the performance year, provided the senior executive is still with  the Company.       The table below outlines this illustrative example:      86  ===== PAGE 87 =====   ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE: VESTING OF OPTIONS  A maximum total of 90,000 options  are allocated to a senior executive  Vesting of each tranche of options under the initial allocation of a  90,000 option pool for a senior executive    BEGINNING  YEAR 1  END OF  YEAR 1  END OF  YEAR 2  END OF  YEAR 3  END OF  YEAR 4  END OF  YEAR 5  Earned options in year  1: 7/10 KPI result    7,000  7,000  7,000      Earned options in year  2: 6/10 KPI result      6,000  6,000  6,000    Earned options in year  3: 9/10 KPI result        9,000  9,000  9,000  (Next EIS scheme  commences)              Unearned options    3,000  7,000  8,000  5,000  1,000  Total options earned  and vested    7,000  13,000  22,000  15,000  9,000    Further performance testing of unvested options at the end of the three-year performance period  For the first round of the EIS (covering FY18 to FY21), options or rights that remained unvested at the end of the  last Performance period (other than those subject only to tenure-based vesting) were subject to further performance  testing. The Board was able to award those rights or options if the team delivered a superior TSR performance  measured as follows:    •  50% of the remaining unvested rights if the Measured TSR at the end of the last Performance vesting period  exceeded the Initial Public Offering Offer Price (“Offer Price”) by 150%; and  •  The remaining 50% of the unvested rights if the Measured TSR at the end of the last Performance vesting  period exceeded the Offer Price by 250%.    As both tests were met at the conclusion of the 2021 financial year, those remaining unvested options were deemed  by the Board to be Performance-vested. These options were then subject to tenure-based vesting.    For the second round of the EIS (covering FY22 to FY24), if any options or rights remain unvested (other than due  to the timing of the grant of such rights), the Board will be able to perform a further performance review at the end  of the 2024 financial year (“FY24”). The Board will be able to award those rights or options if the team has delivered  a superior TSR performance, defined as follows:    •  50% of the remaining unvested rights if the Measured TSR at the end of the last Performance vesting period  (FY24) has exceeded the 2022 financial year (“FY22”) Baseline by 75%; and  •  The remaining 50% of the unvested rights if the Measured TSR at the end of the last Performance vesting  period (FY24) has exceeded the FY22 Baseline by 125%.    If awarded, these rights or options will then be subject to tenure based vesting over three years.    87  ===== PAGE 88 ===== These provisions are a key mechanism to ensure that innovations that create long-term value for shareholders are  rewarded, and that the Company and KMP balance their focus on long-term value creation, while also delivering  on shorter term KPIs focused on the foundations of long term value.     Following on from the illustrative example above, the table below shows how this further performance testing works:    ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE: VESTING OF OPTIONS  A maximum total of 90,000 options  are allocated to a senior executive  Vesting of each tranche of options under the initial allocation of a  90,000 option pool for a senior executive    BEGINNING  YEAR 1  END OF  YEAR 1  END OF  YEAR 2  END OF  YEAR 3  END OF  YEAR 4  END OF  YEAR 5  Earned options in year  1: 7/10 KPI result    7,000  7,000  7,000      Earned options in year  2: 6/10 KPI result      6,000  6,000   6,000    Earned options in year  3: 9/10 KPI result        9,000  9,000  9,000  (Next EIS scheme  commences)              Unearned options  (24,000)    3,000  7,000  8,000  5,000  1,000  Total options earned  and vested    7,000  13,000  22,000  15,000  9,000  Further TSR Test        Test Point      If share price 75%  above FY22 Baseline          50% of  24,000 / 3=  4,000    4,000    4,000    If share price 125%  above FY22 Baseline          100% of  24,000 / 3  = 8,000    8,000    8,000          The following chart illustrates how this part of the EIS operated to benefit shareholders with a strong performing  share price in the five years following the Company’s listing on the ASX.       88  ===== PAGE 89 =====     The outcome illustrated in the chart reinforces the EIS objective to align management and staff with the longer- term to deliver shareholder returns, and reinforces that at-risk remuneration is earned if shareholders benefit from  an appreciation in the value of the Company.    Claw back provision  In the event of fraud, dishonesty, or other material breaches of Company policy, the Board reserves the right to  reassess and reduce or immediately lapse all unexercised rights and/or options, whether vested or not.     The EIS and a successful takeover offer for Calix   In the event of a successful takeover offer for Calix:  •  All rights or options that are both Performance-vested and Tenure-vested (that is, they have been earned, but  not yet exercised) will be converted into shares and included in the equity transaction as part of the takeover;  and  •  If the Board so determines, all rights or options that are Performance-vested but not Tenure-vested are able to  be converted into shares and can be included in the equity transaction as part of the takeover; and  •  If the Board so determines, all rights or options not already either Performance or Tenure-vested can vest and  convert into shares and be included in the equity transaction as part of the takeover.       Vesting of options or rights for performance to 30 June 2023    When applying the performance criteria for the period to 30 June 2023, the Board assessed the actual performance  against the performance vesting criteria as follows:    •  Gateway 1: performance against the Company’s annual safety and quality action plan was met and  achieved in full.  •  Gateway 2: the Board has confirmed that the TSR performance was not met and therefore KMP were  ineligible to receive any performance rights for FY23.  •  Gateway 3: the Group KPI’s were assessed for the business as 6.55 out of 10 (see the KPI Dashboard  for FY23 below for details).    As a result of Gateway 2 not being met, the options for FY23 have not Performance-vested at this point in time.  However, as outlined above, the Board will perform a further performance review in the following manner:   -  1.00  2.00  3.00  4.00  5.00  6.00  7.00  8.00  9.00  10.00 Close Price ($) CXL share price vs IPO offer price  Close  IPO Offer price Threshold 150% Threshold 250% 89  ===== PAGE 90 =====   1.  At the end of FY24, if the absolute TSR is above baseline during the year, Gateway 2 will be met and the  FY23 options will Performance-vest. They will then be subject to tenure-based vesting; or   2.  At the end of FY24, if the team has delivered a superior TSR performance as defined in the further testing  criteria, either 50% or 100% of unearned options from FY21 to FY23, under the second round of the EIS,  will performance vest. They will then be subject to tenure-based vesting.     Gateway 3 measures performance based upon KPIs agreed each year with the Board. The KPIs for FY23 and the  Company’s performance against each follows:        The Water business was judged to have performed well, with the achievement of increased revenue and gross  margin, albeit there were some delays to completing the two new plants. The decision to focus on the US instead  of trying to establish a new presence in the EU, at this time, contributed to a better outcome for the business.     In Biotech, new applications in health were delayed as the Solving Antimicrobial Resistance in Agribusiness, Food,  and Environments Cooperative Research Centre (“SAAFE CRC”) initiative took longer to establish than planned,  although the new livestock project under the SAAFE CRC has potential.     In Advanced Batteries, significant progress was made in production of lithium manganese oxide materials as well  as new chemistries (including lithium iron phosphate), although the commercial format packs were not delivered  by the end of FY23.     In Sustainable Processing, a decision was taken to withdraw focus on refractories, given the relatively slow pace  and size of the market, in favour of larger and faster-moving opportunities in lithium and iron and steel.  Further  expansion of the iron ore program meant the KPI to complete the ore program could not be achieved by 30 June  2023. The Financial Investment Decision for the lithium project with Pilbara Minerals (ASX:PLS) was also delayed  slightly, and achieved in August 2023.     Leilac made considerable progress, albeit completing one, instead of two new licence agreements, and permitting  delays leading to delays in the commencement of site works (demolition) for the Leilac-2 project.     After weighing up the KPI contributions from each line of business, the Board determined a weighted average KPI  score for the Group for FY23 of 6.55 out of 10.

FY24 priorities     Gateway 3 measures performance based upon KPIs agreed each year with the Board. This helps to drive  achievement of annual performance metrics, balancing both short-term and long-term shareholder value creation.  The KPIs agreed by the Board for FY24 follow:        *Magnesia includes the lines of business previously referred to as Water and Biotech. The Magnesia business is focused on  developing and applying Calix’s magnesium-based materials to solve environmental challenges, including its highly active  magnesium oxide materials for water treatment, agriculture, marine and antimicrobial resistance applications.       Additional cash bonus opportunity  If all Company KPIs are achieved in full, and provided the Company also achieves a positive EBITDA, KMP can  also qualify for a cash bonus, payable immediately, that will be shared amongst the total payroll of the Company  based upon base pay, and not exceeding 10% of EBITDA in total. No cash bonuses have been paid to KMP  pursuant to this incentive.    Leilac 91  ===== PAGE 92 ===== This report is signed in accordance with a resolution of the Board of directors.

SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial report are set out below. The financial  report covers the consolidated group of Calix Limited (“the Company”) and its controlled entities (“the Group”).    The following is a summary of the material accounting policies adopted by the Group in the preparation of the  financial report. The accounting policies have been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise  stated.    a)  Basis of preparation  The financial report is a general purpose financial report that has been prepared in accordance and compliance  with Australian Accounting Standards (including Australian Accounting Interpretations) of the Australian Accounting  Standards Board (AASB) and Corporations Act 2001 as appropriate for profit oriented entities; and therefore this  financial report also complies with the International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International  Accounting Standards Board.     (i)  Historical cost convention  The financial report has been prepared on an accrual basis and is based on historical costs, modified, where  applicable by the measurement at fair value of selected non-current assets, financial assets and financial liabilities.    (ii) Critical accounting estimates  The preparation of financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires  management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas  involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant  to the financial statements are disclosed in Note 1(i).    b)  Going concern  The financial report has been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the continuity of normal  business activities and the realisation of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business. During  the year ended 30 June 2023, the Group incurred a net loss after tax of $23,415,054 (June 2022: $16,507,819),  and cash flow out from operating activities of $17,254,052 (June 2022: cash flow out: $3,740,512). As at 30 June  2023, the Group had cash reserves of $74,466,477 (June 2022: $24,982,760), net current assets of $68,181,351  (June 2022: $16,484,153).  The Group has prepared a detailed cash flow forecast which anticipates a positive cash position over the 12-month  period from the date of authorisation of this report.     c)  Material Accounting Policies  Accounting policies are selected and applied in a manner that ensures that the resulting financial information  satisfies the concepts of relevance and reliability, thereby ensuring that the substance of the underlying  transactions or other events is reported. Other material accounting policies are contained in the notes to the  consolidated financial statements to which they relate.                             d)  Rounding of amounts  The Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Legislative Instrument 2016/191, relating to the ‘rounding off’ of  amounts in the directors’ report. Amounts in the directors’ report have been rounded off in accordance with the  instrument       99  ===== PAGE 100 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    1. SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  e)  Goods and services tax  Revenues, expenses, and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST, except where the amount of GST  incurred is not recoverable from the Australian Tax Office. In these circumstances the GST is recognised as part  of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of an item of the expense. Receivables and payables in the  statement of financial position are shown inclusive of GST.  f)  New or amended accounting standards and interpretations  The group has adopted all of the new or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the  Australian Accounting Standards Board (“AASB”) that are mandatory for the current reporting period. Any new or  amended Accounting Standards or Interpretations that are not yet mandatory have not been early adopted.  g)  New accounting standards and interpretations not yet mandatory or early adopted  Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have recently been issued or amended but are not yet  mandatory, have not been early adopted by the consolidated entity for the annual reporting period ended 30 June  2023. The Group has not yet assessed the impact of these new or amended Accounting Standards and  Interpretations.    h)  Foreign currency transactions and balances  Functional and presentation currency  The functional currency of each of the Group's entities is measured using the currency of the primary economic  environment in which that entity operates. The consolidated financial statements are presented in Australian Dollars  which is the Group's functional and presentation currency.    Transactions and balances  Foreign currency transactions are translated into functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the  date of transaction. Foreign currency monetary items are translated at the year-end exchange rate. Non-monetary  items measured at historical cost continue to be carried at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non- monetary items measured at fair value are reported at the exchange rate at the date when fair values were  determined.    Exchange differences arising on the translation of monetary items are recognised in the profit or loss, except where  deferred in equity as a qualifying cash flow or net investment hedge.    Exchange difference arising on translation of non-monetary items are recognised directly in equity to the extent  that the gain or loss is directly recognised in equity, otherwise the exchange difference is recognised in the profit  or loss.        100  ===== PAGE 101 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    1. SUMMARY OF MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  Group companies  The financial results and position of foreign operations whose functional currency is different from the Group's  presentation currency are translated as follows:    •  assets and liabilities are translated at year-end exchange rates prevailing at that reporting date  •  income and expense are translated at average exchange rates for the year; and  •  retained earnings are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction.    Exchange differences arising on translation of foreign operations are transferred directly to the Group's foreign  currency translation reserve in the statement of financial position. These differences are also recognised in the  statement of comprehensive income as other comprehensive income. The foreign currency reserve is recognised  in profit or loss when the foreign operation is disposed of.    i)  Critical accounting estimates and judgments  The directors evaluate estimates and judgements incorporated into the financial report based on historical  knowledge and best available current information. Estimates assume a reasonable expectation of future events  and are based on current trends and economic data, obtained both externally and within the Group. Information on  material estimates and judgements used in applying the accounting policies can be found in the following notes:      Judgement Area    Note  Revenue and other income   3  Income tax   5  Recovery of trade and other receivables  7  Inventory  8  Intangibles  9  Goodwill impairment test  10  Property, plant and equipment  11  Right of use assets and lease liabilities  14  Provisions  15  Share-based payment transactions  19        101  ===== PAGE 102 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    2. SEGMENT INFORMATION  The Group identifies its operating segments based on the internal reports that are reviewed and used by the Group’s  chief operating decision makers (“CODM”). The CODM consists of the Executive KMP as disclosed in the  Remuneration Report on pages 80-92. For the year ended 30 June 2023, the Group has identified three segments  based on the geographical regions and business line in which they operate. The LEILAC segment is in Europe with  a small US subsidiary who collectively are the CO2 mitigation business line, the US segment is the US section of  the water business line, and the Australian & SE Asian segments comprise of all business segments. The Group  has continued to implement a business line reporting approach in the current financial year and is looking to continue  improving upon the implementation in the next financial year.

The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be  reliably measured, it is probable that the future economic benefits will flow to the entity and specific criteria have  been met for each of the Group’s activities as described below.     Sales of goods   Revenue for these activities are recognised when the customers obtain control of these assets at the point in time  when the customer has obtained control of the goods which is considered to be fulfilment of the performance  obligation. Payment terms are usually 30 days after receipt of the goods. For sales of dosing units, warranties are  negotiated in each contract of sale.    Services transferred over time   Revenue for these activities are recognised as the customers obtains the benefit of the service over time; rental  income is recognised in the corresponding rental period that a service is provided on a straight line basis. If  payments are received in advance that income is deferred into the period that the service is delivered.    Grant income   Grant income is recognised when it is received or when the right to receive payment is established. Government  grants relating to costs are deferred and recognised in the profit or loss over the period necessary to match them  with the costs that they are intended to compensate.    R&D incentive income  The R&D incentive income recognised as other income is in relation to eligible research expenditure incurred for  the current projects. The claimed amounts have been reviewed externally to ensure they are in accordance with  the requirements of the Australian Taxation Office and AusIndustry.    Interest income  Interest income is recognised using the effective interest rate method, which for floating rate financial assets is the  rate inherent in the instrument.       104  ===== PAGE 105 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    3. REVENUE AND OTHER INCOME (CONTINUED)  Other Income  Other income includes gains on disposal of items of property, plant and equipment and receipts. The amount of  the income is determined as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item.

There were no  income tax effects from overseas subsidiaries.  **The Group accounts for R&D tax incentives as a government grant under AASB 120, resulting in the incentive  being recognised in the profit or loss; however the R&D expenditure is treated as non-deductible for tax purposes.    Recognition and Measurement     Current tax  The income tax benefit for the year comprises current income tax benefit, research and development claim and  deferred tax benefit. Current income tax expense charged to the profit or loss is the tax payable on taxable income  calculated using applicable income tax rates enacted, or substantially enacted, as at the end of the reporting period  together with the research and development claim submitted for the reporting period. Current tax liabilities/assets  are therefore measured at the amounts expected to be paid to/recovered from the relevant taxation authority.      107  ===== PAGE 108 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    5. INCOME TAX (CONTINUED)  Deferred tax  Deferred income tax expense reflects movements in deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability balances during  the year as well as unused tax losses. Current and deferred income tax expense/(benefit) is charged or credited  directly to equity instead of the profit or loss when the tax relates to items that are credited or charged directly to  equity.    Deferred tax assets and liabilities are ascertained based on temporary differences arising between the tax bases  of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets also result where  amounts have been fully expensed but future tax deductions are available. No deferred income tax will be  recognised from the initial recognition of an asset or liability, excluding a business combination, where there is no  effect on accounting or taxable profit or loss.    Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the  asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the  reporting period. Their measurement also reflects the manner in which management expects to recover or settle  the carrying amount of the related asset or liability. Deferred tax assets relating to temporary differences and  unused tax losses are recognised only to the extent that is it probable that future taxable profit will be available  against which the benefits of the deferred tax asset can be utilised.     Where the temporary difference exists in relation to investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and joint  ventures, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised where the timing of the reversal of the temporary  difference can be controlled and it is not probable that the reversal will occur in the foreseeable future.    Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right of set-off exists and it is intended that  net settlement or simultaneous realisation and settlement of the respective asset and liability will occur. Deferred  tax assets and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right of set-off exists, the deferred tax assets and  liabilities related to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different  taxable entities where it is intended that the net settlement or simultaneous realisation and settlement of the  respective asset and liability will occur in future periods in which significant  amounts of deferred assets or liabilities  are expected to be recovered or settled.      6.

They are presented as current assets unless collection  is not expected for more than 12 months after the reporting date. Trade receivables are generally due for settlement  within 30 days.    Recoverability of trade receivables    Credit risk management processes  Credit risk is managed through the maintenance of procedures ensuring to the extent possible, that customers and  counterparties to transactions are of sound credit worthiness. Such monitoring is used in assessing receivables for  impairments. Where the Group is unable to ascertain a satisfactory credit risk profile in relation to a customer or  counterparty, the risk may be further managed through obtaining security by way of personal or commercial  guarantees over assets of sufficient value which can be claimed against in the event of any default. Where a  creditor is more than 60 days overdue, and there is no agreed payment plan in place, the debt shall be considered  impaired and a bad debt provision shall be raised in accordance with the Group’s policy on recoverability of trade  receivables, see Note 21. Where a debtor is more than 90 days overdue, and there is no agreed payment plan in  place, the debt shall be defined to be in default on the basis that there is a low expectation of recoverability of the  amount.    Recognition and measurement of expected credit losses  The Group applies the AASB 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime  expected loss allowance for all trade receivables and contract assets. Trade receivables and contract assets have  shared credit risk characteristics and, as such, the expected loss rates for trade receivables are a reasonable  approximation of loss rates for contract assets. Losses incurred in the last 3 years represent less than 1% of  receivables and are immaterial. Therefore, no provision for expected credit losses has been recorded.    Other receivables are recognised at amortised cost, less any provision for expected credit losses.    Due to the short-term nature of the receivables, their carrying amount is assumed to approximate fair value. The  maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporting period is the carrying amount of each class of  receivables mentioned above. Refer to Note 21 for more information on the risk management policy of the Group  and credit quality of the receivables.     109  ===== PAGE 110 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    7. TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES (CONTINUED)  R&D incentive receivable   The Company is eligible, in the current year, for an R&D grant which is receivable after the Australia Tax Office  processes the Company’s tax return. The amount of R&D grant receivable is accrued based on eligible expenses  incurred during the financial year.   The company exceeded the $20m group turnover threshold to be eligible for the R&D incentive rebate in the prior  year and therefore was not eligible for the cash rebate from the ATO.   Deposit paid  The balance of deposits paid comprise prepayment associated with supply of utilities for Bacchus Marsh; a  guarantee on the office sites at Pymble; deposits for an overseas employment agency; and a bond paid to the  Department of Energy & Mining in South Australia for future mine rehabilitation work.  Director advances  See directors’ report on loans made to directors in the prior year. The fair value of the advances were considered  to be at face value as they were repayable before the end of the calendar year.    8.

The costs were recognised on the basis that they were incurred  in the development phase, in accordance with AASB 138, through the demonstration of technical feasibility of  completion, the intention to complete and use or sell the assets, as well as the clear path to economic benefits, the  availability of technical and financial resources, and reliable measurement of expenditure. The capitalised  development costs are not amortised until the associated product and service are demonstrated to be available for  commercial use and an appropriate amortisation period set.    Patent and trademarks  Patents and trademarks are recognised at cost of acquisition. Patents and trademarks have a finite life and are  carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses. Amortisation is systematically  allocated over the useful life of each patent and trademark. In calculating amortisation costs, patents are taken to  have a useful life of 20 years, trademarks are taken to have a useful life of 10 years.    10. GOODWILL    June 2023  $  June 2022  $  Goodwill  3,638,392  3,638,392  Total goodwill  3,638,392  3,638,392    Accounting for goodwill  Goodwill arises on the acquisition of a business where the fair value of the consideration exceeds the fair value of  the net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortised, instead it is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired and is carried as cost less accumulated  impairment losses.   Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount to the carrying value of the asset. For the  current period, the recoverable amount was determined based on value-in-use calculations which required the use  of assumptions. In order to calculate the value-in-use, cash flows associated with the US operations, which is the  cash generating unit to which the goodwill was assigned, was forecasted for the next 5 years. Historical averages  were the primary sources of assumed values. Where possible, these were cross referenced with external sources.  The growth rate used in the cash flow forecast from the second year was 2.6%, being the prior year’s US inflation  rate, rather than the higher internally budgeted growth rate. The discount rate used in the cash flow forecast was  10%, being an externally sourced rate based on an analysis of the Group. These growth and discount rates were  also used to determine the terminal value.      112  ===== PAGE 113 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    10. NON-CURRENT ASSETS – GOODWILL (CONTINUED)    A sensitivity analysis was performed on the key assumptions of the cash flow forecast to determine how much  each of the assumptions would have to move in order for the recoverable amount to drop below the carrying amount  for the goodwill. In the case of the growth factor, this would need to drop to below 0.8% before an impairment would  need to be recognised. In the case of the discount factor, this would need to rise above 13.5% before an impairment  would need to be recognised. Impairment losses on goodwill are taken to the profit or loss and not subsequently  reversed.    11.

NON-CURRENT ASSETS – PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (CONTINUED)    Recognition and Measurement      Each class of plant and equipment is carried at cost or fair value as indicated less, where applicable, any  accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Plant and equipment are measured on the cost basis less  depreciation and impairment losses. The cost of plant and equipment constructed includes the cost of materials,  direct labour, borrowing costs and an appropriate proportion of fixed and variable overheads. Subsequent costs  are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is  probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can  be measure reliably. All other repairs and maintenance expenses are charged to the income statements during the  financial period in which they are incurred.    Property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land, is depreciated or amortised on a straight-line basis over  the expected useful life for the asset. Estimated useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed at the end of  the reporting period. The depreciation rates used for each class for depreciable assets are shown in the list below.  Land is not subject to depreciation.    •  Office, furniture, fittings and equipment- 10%-25%  •  Baccus Marsh calciner and R&D facilities – 5%-25%  •  Slurry manufacturing and application assets – 2%-50%  •  LEILAC plants – 20-33%  •  Mining tenements – extraction rate of ore  •  UJV Midstream Project – work in progress – not depreciating yet    The assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date. An  asset's carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset's carrying amount is  greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing  proceeds with the carrying amount. These gains or losses are included in the statement of comprehensive income.  When re-valued assets are sold, amounts included in the revaluation reserve relating to that asset are transferred  to retained earnings.    Mining tenements and associated mineral resources    The costs of acquiring mining tenements and associated mineral resources are capitalised as part of property plant  and equipment and amortised over the estimated productive life of each applicable resource. Amortisation  commences when extraction of the mineral resource commences. The tenement is expected to be retired in 2044.    Impairment     In the year ended 30 June 2023, no assets were found to require impairment under the Group’s accounting policy  (2022: $32,394).           115  ===== PAGE 116 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    12.

The balance is recognised as a  current liability with the amount being normally paid within 30 days of recognition of the liability.  The carrying amounts of the Group’s trade and other payables are denominated in Australian dollars. Due to the  short-term nature of the payables, their carrying amount is assumed to approximate fair value. For an analysis of  the financial risks associated with trade and other payables refer to Note 21.    13.

Borrowings are subsequently  measured at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds and the redemption amount is recognised as  profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.   Where there is an unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting  date, the loans or borrowings are classified as non-current.    Loan facility  Inland Environmental Resources, Inc. (IER) has a working capital facility for up to USD 500,000 with Umpqua Bank  to assist with funding capital expenditures at an interest rate of 9.25% p.a.  Other borrowings  The other borrowings balances comprise of asset financing facilities totalling $15,262 (2022: $48,455) with an  interest rate ranging from 5.78% p.a., and insurance premium funding facilities totalling $NIL (2022: $114,662).      116  ===== PAGE 117 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    13.

The right-of-use asset is measured at  cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for, as applicable, any lease payments made  at or before the commencement date net of any lease incentives received, any initial direct costs incurred, and an  estimate of costs expected to be incurred for dismantling and removing the underlying asset, and restoring the site  or asset. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the unexpired period of the lease or the  estimated useful life of the asset, whichever is the shorter. Where the Group expects to obtain ownership of the  leased asset at the end of the lease term, the depreciation is over its estimated useful life. Right-of use assets are  subject to impairment or adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.       117  ===== PAGE 118 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    14.   RIGHT OF USE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES (CONTINUED)  The Group has elected not to recognise a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability for short-term leases  with terms of 12 months or less and leases of assets whose fair value is less than $10,000. Lease payments on  these assets are expensed to profit or loss as incurred.  Lease liabilities  A lease liability is recognised at the commencement date of a lease. The lease liability is initially recognised at the  present value of the lease payments to be made over the term of the lease, discounted using the interest rate  implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Lease  payments comprise of fixed payments less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend  on an index or a rate, amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase  option when the exercise of the option is reasonably certain to occur, and any anticipated termination penalties.   The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are expensed in the period in which they  are incurred. Lease liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The carrying  amounts are remeasured if there is a change in the following: future lease payments arising from a change in an  index, or a rate used; residual guarantee; lease term; certainty of a purchase option and termination penalties.  When a lease liability is remeasured, an adjustment is made to the corresponding right-of use asset, or to profit or  loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is fully written down.    15.

PROVISIONS (CONTINUED)  Recognition and Measurement  Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past  event, and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the  obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.    Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle  the present obligation at the reporting date. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are  determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments  of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision  resulting from the passage of time is recognised in finance costs.    Employee benefits    Provision is made for the Group's liability for employee benefits arising from services rendered by employees to  balance date. Employee benefits that are expected to be settled within one year have been measured at the  amounts expected to be paid when the liability is settled, plus related on-costs.     Employee benefits payable later than one year have been measured at the present value of the estimated future  cash outflows to be made for those benefits. In determining the liability, consideration is given to employee wage  increases and the probability that the employee may satisfy vesting requirements. Those cash flows are discounted  using market yields on national government bonds with terms to maturity that match the expected timing of cash  flows.    Short-term employee benefits  Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits, annual leave and long service leave expected  to be settled wholly within 12 months of the reporting date are recognised in current liabilities in respect of  employees' services up to the reporting date and are measured at nominal amounts.    Other long-term employee benefits  The liability for annual leave and long service leave not expected to be wholly settled within 12 months of the  reporting date are recognised in non-current liabilities, provided there is an unconditional right to defer settlement  of the liability. The liability is measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of  services provided by employees up to the reporting date using the projected unit credit method. Consideration is  given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service.  Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the reporting date on national government bonds  with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.    Rehabilitation provision    The Group recognises a mine rehabilitation provision on the basis that it has an obligation to restore the site of the  mine in Myrtle Springs to its original condition and the cost to do so is uncertain. The measurement of the provision  is the present value of the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation as at the end of the  reporting period. It should also be noted that a bond of $274,000 was lodged on 9 October 2014 with the South  Australia Department of State Development to be applied to rehabilitation of the area at cessation of mining activity,  on the basis of a Program for Environmental Protection and Rehabilitation (PEPR) which was approved by the  South Australia Department of State Development. This bond appears in Note 7 under deposits paid.        119  ===== PAGE 120 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    16.

Ordinary shares have no par value and the Company does not have a limited amount of authorised  capital.    Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Any transaction costs arising on the issue of ordinary shares are  recognised directly in equity as a reduction of the share proceeds received.              122  ===== PAGE 123 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    17.

In this way, the share-based payment reserve is reversed for the amount of the shares and  the shares are transferred to the recipient. During the year ended 30 June 2023, $nil in shares were issued from  the ESS trust (2022: $nil).

The cumulative amount is  reclassified to profit or loss when the net investment is disposed of.    Share-based payment reserve  The share-based payment reserve is used to recognise shares and rights earned by employees and officers as  part of the ESS plan and the EIS. Shares issued through the ESS are valued at the grant date fair value of shares  issued and vested to employees and directors. These reserves are reversed against share capital held by ESS  plan when the shares vest. The rights which are as part of the EIS are valued using options valuation models which  take into account vesting criteria, market price and the exercise windows. See Note 19 for more information on  share-based payments.              124  ===== PAGE 125 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    18. RESERVES (CONTINUTED)    Warrant reserve  On 20 July 2018, the Company issued 2,359,155 warrants, which expired on 30 June 2022 at a strike price of  $0.66 per share to financial advisers and joint lead managers as part of the non-cash costs for the IPO. These  warrants were valued at $488,393 using a Black-Scholes pricing model (share price of $0.66 per share, an  expected volatility of 100% of the underlying share, and an average risk-free rate of 2.74% for the term of the  warrants).  The warrants were accounted for as equity (warrant reserve) in accordance with AASB 2 on the basis that the  warrant strike price was not subject to any adjustments and conversion of shares is fixed. The warrants in the  reserve were non-distributable and were to be transferred to share premium account upon the exercise of the  warrants. Any balance of warrants reserve in relation to the unexercised warrants at expiry of the warrants period  were transferred to accumulated profits.     19. SHARE BASED PAYMENTS  Calix Officers & Employees Incentive Scheme  EIS 1  On 18 April 2018 at an extraordinary general meeting, the shareholders approved a new EIS to operate once the  Company is listed. The EIS (EIS 1) provides for the grant of rights and/or options to eligible officers and employees  (as determined by the Board) and is intended to provide competitive, performance-based remuneration supporting  the retention, incentive and reward functions of that remuneration and drive alignment with shareholders.     During the years ended 30 June 2020 to 30 June 2023, the Group recognised a share based payment expense  related to the number of rights vesting and to be vested in connection with the fulfilment of the vesting conditions  related to these financial periods as well as the forecasted value of those rights at their expected exercise date.    During the year, Calix granted a total of no new EIS 1 rights (2022: nil new rights) at an exercise price of $NIL. Of  the total rights granted to date, 7,936,187 were exercisable at the end of the period (2022: 4,651,254), while nil  were forfeited during the year (2022: NIL). 1,354,707 rights were exercised during the period (2022: 1,714,591)  and no rights expired during the period (2022: NIL). The balance of rights at the end of the year is 4,313,485 (2022:  7,382,781). The fair value on issue of these rights is $2,164,260. An expense of $46,072 was recognised during  the year in order to revalue the share-based payment reserve in accordance with the updated valuation model and  fair value of the EIS rights.    EIS 2  On 29 September 2021 at a directors meeting, a second EIS scheme (EIS 2) was approved for the eligible officers  and employees (as determined by the Board). During the years ended 30 June 2023, the Group recognised a share  based payment expense related to the number of rights vesting and to be vested in connection with the fulfilment  of the vesting conditions related to these financial periods as well as the forecasted value of those rights at their  expected exercise date. For non senior leadership team employees the fair value of the options was determined to  be the share price on the date the terms and conditions of the offer was given to the employees. For the senior  leadership team a binomial option pricing model was used for valuing the options, as market based conditions  attach to these option.     125  ===== PAGE 126 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    19.

Of the  total rights granted to date, 739,845 were exercisable at the end of the period (2022: NIL), while nil were forfeited  during the year (2022: NIL). 51,355 rights were exercised during the period (2022: NIL) and no rights expired during  the period (2022: NIL). The balance of rights at the end of the year is 658,020 (2022: NIL). The fair value on issue  of these rights is $2,427,090. An expense of $2,694,546 was recognised during the year in order to revalue the  share-based payment reserve in accordance with the updated valuation model and fair value of the EIS rights.  Share options, across both EIS schemes, were exercised at a weighted average share price of $5.05 during the  period.     20. LOSS PER SHARE      June 2023  $  June 2022  $  a.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT    The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk (including foreign currency risk  and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s Treasury function is responsible for managing the  liquidity requirements of the Group and mitigating these financial risks through continuous monitoring and  evaluation.    The Group adheres to a set of policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on  liquidity risk, foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and the use of derivative financial instruments, as  required, for hedging purposes. The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative  financial instruments, for speculative purposes. There have been no changes to the Group’s exposure to financial  risks or the manner in which it manages and measures these risks from the prior year.  The Group holds the following financial instruments, all of which are measured at amortised cost:    June 2023  $  June 2022  $  Financial assets       Cash and cash equivalents   74,466,477  24,982,760  Current trade and other receivables   1,838,729  2,970,148  Non-current trade and other receivables   292,735  284,419  Total financial assets  76,597,941  28,237,327        Financial liabilities       Trade and other payables   3,431,920  3,256,009  Current borrowings   318,294  863,489  Current lease liabilities  354,732  277,535  Non-current borrowings   7,372  15,261  Non-current lease liabilities  636,716  315,390  Total financial liabilities  6,584,269  4,727,684    (a) Credit risk  Exposure to credit risk relating to financial assets arises from the potential non-performance by counterparties of  contract obligations that could lead to a financial loss to the Group.    Credit risk is managed through the maintenance of procedures ensuring to the extent possible, that customers and  counterparties to transactions are of sound credit worthiness. Such monitoring is used in assessing receivables for  impairments. Risk is also minimised through investing surplus funds in financial institutions that maintain a high  credit rating, or in entities that the Audit and Risk Management Committee (“ARMC”) has otherwise cleared as  being financially sound.    Where the Group is unable to ascertain a satisfactory credit risk profile in relation to a customer or counterparty,  the risk may be further managed through obtaining security by way of personal or commercial guarantees over  assets of sufficient value which can be claimed against in the event of any default.        127  ===== PAGE 128 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    21. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)  Credit risk exposure  The maximum exposure to credit risk by class of recognised financial assets at balance date, excluding the value  of any collateral or other security held, is equivalent to the carrying value of the trade and other receivables (net of  any provisions).    There is no significant concentration of credit risk with any single counter party or group of counter parties.   Past due but not impaired  As at 30 June 2023, trade receivables of $28,958 were past due but not impaired (2022: $27,811). These relate to  a number of independent customers for whom there is not recent history of default. The aging analysis of trade  receivables is as below:    June 2023  $  June 2022  $        Current                       1,442,684                        1,327,757   Less than 30 days overdue                            54,508                             77,606   Less than 60 days overdue                            -                              21,192   More than 60 days overdue                            25,236                             27,811   Total trade receivables                       1,522,428                        1,454,366     The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets and are not past due. Based  on the credit history of these other classes, it is expected that these amounts will be received when due. The  Group does not hold any collateral in relation to theses receivables.  (b) Liquidity risk  Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that the Group might encounter difficulty in settling its debts or otherwise  meetings its obligations related to financial liabilities.    Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents and the availability of  funding through adequate amount of credit facilities to meet obligations when due.    Management monitors the Groups liquidity levels (comprising undrawn borrowing facilities (Note 13) and cash and  cash equivalents (Note 6) on the basis of expected cash flows.        128  ===== PAGE 129 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    21.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)  (c) Interest rate risk  Exposure to interest rate risk relates to cash and cash equivalents and borrowings, details of which are set out in  Notes 6 and 13.  Profit or loss is sensitive to higher/lower interest income from cash and cash equivalents and interest expenses on  borrowings as a result of changes in interest rates. The following analysis shows the impact on post tax profit as a  result of a movement in interest income and expense from variable interest rate deposit and borrowing facilities.    Impact on post tax  profit  2023  $  Impact on post tax  profit  2022  $        Increase by 100 basis points  220,998  43,801  Decrease by 100 basis points  (220,998)  (43,801)    (d) Foreign exchange risk  Exposure to foreign exchange risk may result in the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument  fluctuating due to movement in foreign exchange rates of currencies in which the Group holds financial instruments  other than the Australian Dollar (AUD) functional currency of the Group. With instruments being held by overseas  entities, fluctuations in US Dollars (USD), UK Pound Sterling (GBP) and Euro (EUR) may impact on the Group’s  financial results unless those exposures are appropriately hedged.    The following table shows the foreign currency risk on the significant financial assets and liabilities held in  denominations of currencies other than the functional currency of the Group.

(1)  Westside Environmental Resources LLC (“WER”) was established as a structured vehicle to serve a single customer of  the US business. The entity was established by the Group and structured to ensure that the Group was the sole supplier  of materials to WER under an exclusive toll processing agreement.                           Consolidation accounting policies        Business combinations occur where an acquirer obtains control over one or more businesses and results in the  consolidation of assets and liabilities. A business combination is accounted for by applying the acquisition method,  unless it is a combination involving entities or businesses under common control. The acquisition method requires  that for each business combination one of the combining entities must be identified as the acquirer (i.e. parent  entity).     The business combination will be accounted for as at the acquisition date, which is the date that control over the  acquiree is obtained by the parent entity. At this date, the parent shall recognise, in the consolidated accounts, and  subject to certain limited exceptions, the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In  addition, contingent liabilities of the acquiree will be recognised where a present obligation has been incurred and  its fair value can be reliably measured.    The acquisition may result in the recognition of goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase. The method adopted  for the measurement of goodwill will impact on the measurement of any non-controlling interest to be recognised  in the acquiree where less than 100% ownership interest is held in the acquiree.    The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred for a business combination plus the acquisition date  fair value of any previously held equity interest shall form the cost of the investment in the separate financial  statements.        132  ===== PAGE 133 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023    23.  SUBSIDARIES (CONTINUED)    Consideration may comprise the sum of the assets transferred by the acquirer, liabilities incurred by the acquirer  to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interest issued by the acquirer. Included in the measurement  of consideration transferred is any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Any  obligation incurred relating to contingent consideration is classified as either a financial liability or equity instrument,  depending upon the nature of the arrangement. All transaction costs incurred in relation to the business  combination are expensed to the consolidated income statement.      24. JOINT ARRANGEMENTS    The Company holds a 45% interest in the “Midstream UJV”. The unincorporated joint venture agreement requires  a supermajority vote, being 75% of the total participating interest, for all major joint arrangement decisions. These  include setting budgets, work programs, manager or auditor appointment and other significant actions. The two  joint venturers own the assets of the partnership as tenants in common and are jointly and severally liable for the  liabilities incurred by the partnership. The entity is therefore classified as a joint operation and the consolidated  entity recognises its share of all jointly held assets and liabilities, and their associated revenues and expenses.  See notes 10 & 11 for further details.    25.

NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS    (a) Disposals to non-controlling interests    On 15 September 2021 global decarbonisation investor Carbon Direct Capital Management LLC (“Carbon Direct”)  invested €15m for a 6.98% equity stake in Calix (Europe) Limited, a subsidiary of Calix Limited. This investment  was made to aid the acceleration of the development and deployment of the Group’s LEILAC technology for the  decarbonisation of lime and cement industries. Carbon Direct will advise on areas including capital markets,  regulations, commercial and technical development and help to scale this business line.     The Group applies a policy of treating transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners  of the Group. For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the  relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is deducted from equity. For disposals  to non-controlling interests, differences between any proceeds received and the relevant share of non-controlling  interests are recorded in equity. As a result, the difference between $22,845,374 AUD received (net of $1,042,697  transaction costs) and $1,669,052 related to the share of Carbon Direct is accounted for as equity reserves,  amounting to $21,176,322 as at 30 June 2023 in the statement of changes in equity.

Carbon Direct’s share of the loss since disposal, $381,936 (2022: $182,097), is disclosed as part of  non-controlling interest in the income statements.      32. AFTER BALANCE DATE EVENTS    On 2 August, 2023, the Group announced that the joint venture project with Pilbara Minerals Limited (ASX:PLS) to  construct a ~3000 tonne per annum lithium phosphate production facility had passed its final investment decision.  The project involves the commitment by the Group of A$17.5m in capital to construct the facility at Pilbara Mineral’s  Pilgangoora mine site in Western Australia for a 45% share of the joint operation. Calix’s contribution will be capped  at $17.5m of the estimated $104.9m construction costs (except for cost overruns which will be shared by both  parties).   No other matters or circumstances have arisen since the end of the year which significantly affected, or may  significantly affect, the operations of the Group, the results of those operations, or the state of affairs of the Group  in future years.           136  ===== PAGE 137 =====   Notes to the Financial Report  For the year ended 30 June 2023      DIRECTORS’ DECLARATION    1.

We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Corporations  Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board’s  APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code)  that are relevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia.  We have also fulfilled our other  ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.  We confirm that the independence declaration required by the Corporations Act 2001, which has been  given to the directors of the Company, would be in the same terms if given to the directors as at the  time of this auditor’s report.  We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis  for our opinion.   Key audit matters  Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in  our audit of the financial report of the current period.  These matters were addressed in the context of  our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide  a separate opinion on these matters.       138  ===== PAGE 139 =====   Key audit matter   How the matter was addressed in our audit  Accounting for the unincorporated joint venture  with Pilbara Minerals  As detailed in Note 11 and Note 24 to the financial  statements, Pilbara Minerals (PLS) and Calix have  executed an unincorporated joint venture (UJV)  agreement for the development of a Demonstration  Plant at the Pilgangoora Project with the aim of  producing lithium salts via an innovative midstream  value-added refining process utilising Calix’s  patented calcination technology, as well as future  commercialisation of the process.  This unincorporated joint venture is considered a  material transaction during the period.  In our view,  the accounting for the transaction is significant to  our audit as the Group might inappropriately account  for the joint venture, and the accounting policies  and presentation of the arrangement may be  incorrect.     The procedures performed in response to this key  audit matter included, but were not limited to:  •  Obtaining and reviewing the unincorporated  joint venture agreement;  •  In consultation with BDO IFRS technical  specialists, evaluating Calix’s assessment of  the appropriate accounting treatment under  AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Statements  and AASB 11 Joint Arrangements;  •  Evaluating the Calix’s assessment of the  carrying value of the investment in the joint  venture; and  •  Performing substantive testing over the  associated transactions during the year and  ensuring the treatment is consistent with the  application of the Australian Accounting  Standards.  Research and development (R&D) tax receivable  As detailed in Note 3 and Note 7 to the financial  statements, the Group recognises a material balance  of R&D incentive income and receivable.  Eligibility of the R&D incentive and accuracy of  calculation was considered a key audit matter,  together with ensuring it was appropriately  accounted for in accordance with the requirements  of AASB 120 Accounting for Government Grants and  Disclosure of Government Assistance.  We have focused on this area as a key audit matter  due to the amounts involved being material, the  conditions and requirements for eligibility, and the  inherent subjectivity associated with the calculation  of R&D tax incentives.  The procedures performed in response to this key  audit matter included, but were not limited to:  •  In consultation with BDO’s R&D tax expert,  evaluated and assessed the reasonableness  and eligibility criteria of the R&D calculation  to consider the recoverability of the claim.  •  Obtained and reviewed the R&D tax rebate  receivable calculation and considered the  inputs and assumptions included within the  calculations; and  •  Performed analytical procedures over the key  categories of the R&D calculation, comparing  against prior years and expectations  developed from discussing with management  and supporting information.  Share based payments  As detailed in Note 19 of the financial statements,  the Group has Employee Incentive Schemes in place  which result in the recognition of share-based  payments. During the year ended 30 June 2023, the  Group issued share options under a second EIS  scheme (EIS 2).  The Group uses assumptions in relation to current  and future market and non-market conditions.  Due to the complex and judgemental estimates used  in determining the value of the share-based payment  expense for the year, we consider this to be a key  audit matter.  The procedures performed in response to this key  audit matter included, but were not limited to:  •  Reviewing relevant supporting documentation  to obtain an understanding of the contractual  nature and terms and conditions of the share- based payment arrangements;  •  Reviewing management’s determination of  the fair value of the share-based payments  granted, considering the appropriateness of  the valuation models used and assessing the  valuation inputs;       139  ===== PAGE 140 =====     •  In consultation with BDO’s valuation  specialist, assess the reasonableness of  management’s valuation of the fair value of  options with market vesting conditions;  •  Assessing management’s determination of  achieving non-market vesting conditions;  •  Assessing the appropriate allocation of the  share-based payment expense over the  relevant vesting periods; and   •  Assessing the adequacy of the related  disclosures in the financial report.  Other information   The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the  information in the Directors’ Report (excluding the audited Remuneration Report section) for the year  ended 30 June 2023, but does not include the financial report and the auditor’s report thereon, which  we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, and the Annual Report to Shareholders, which is  expected to be made available to us after that date.  Our opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and we do not express any  form of assurance conclusion thereon.   In connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information  and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial  report or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.   If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date  of this auditor’s report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information,  we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.  When we read the Annual Report to Shareholders, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement  therein, we are required to communicate the matter to the directors and will request that it is  corrected.  If it is not corrected, we will seek to have the matter appropriately brought to the  attention of users for whom our report is prepared.  Responsibilities of the directors for the Financial Report   The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a  true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001  and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the  financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to  fraud or error.  In preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the group to  continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the  going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease  operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.           140  ===== PAGE 141 =====     Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Report   Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free  from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that  includes our opinion.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an  audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material  misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material  if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic  decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.   A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial report is located at the  Auditing and Assurance Standards Board website (http://www.auasb.gov.au/Home.aspx) at:  https://www.auasb.gov.au/admin/file/content102/c3/ar1_2020.pdf  This description forms part of our auditor’s report.    Report on the Remuneration Report  Opinion on the Remuneration Report   We have audited the Remuneration Report included in the directors’ report under the heading  ‘Remuneration Report’ for the year ended 30 June 2023.  In our opinion, the Remuneration Report of Calix Limited, for the year ended 30 June 2023, complies  with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001.   Responsibilities  The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation and presentation of the  Remuneration Report in accordance with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001.  Our responsibility  is to express an opinion on the Remuneration Report, based on our audit conducted in accordance with  Australian Auditing Standards.

SEPTEMBER 2021 Solving global challenges  ===== PAGE 2 ===== Solving Global Challenges has been the basis of Calix’s passion and business for more than  a decade, with a mission to urgently develop great businesses, leveraging our patented  technology, that deliver positive global impact. At Calix, we continuously ask the following question of ourselves: with global climate, energy, and sustainability issues set to intensify, how can we use innovation and teamwork  to develop solutions that solve the challenges that are increasingly putting our planet at  risk? Sustainability means meeting our own needs without compromising the ability of future  generations to meet their own needs. It is deeply embedded in our purpose, the reason we  exist: “Because Mars is for quitters.” Sustainability is not just about environmentalism, but adds social and economic concerns  to the world’s development agenda. Since 2020, Calix has been a member of the United  Nations Global Compact (UNGC), supporting its ten founding principles related to human  rights, labour standards, environmental protection and anti-corruption. The United Nations Global Compact is the world’s largest corporate sustainability initiative, driven by the realisation that companies play a crucial part in enforcing human  rights and building a more sustainable world.  With the broad-based support of all 193 participant countries of the United Nations General Assembly, the UN Global Compact remains the single, global normative authority  and reference point for action and leadership within a growing global corporate  sustainability movement. Currently, there are over 13,500 participants in 162 countries. “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed people can  change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.” Margaret Mead Our annual Communication on Progress (COP) shares with you the progress we have made  towards the Ten Principles and the development of our responsible business practices. By living our purpose and delivering on our strategy, we believe we can make a positive difference on the society at large for the long-term while maximising positive outcomes  and growth for our customers and shareholders.

Calix will make a clear statement of this commitment to our  stakeholders and the general public. We recognize that a key requirement for participation in the UN Global Compact is the annual submission of a  Communication on Progress (COP) that describes our company’s efforts to implement the Ten Principles. We  support public accountability and transparency and therefore commit to report on progress within one year of  joining the UN Global Compact, and annually thereafter according to the UN Global Compact COP policy. This includes: • A statement signed by the Chief Executive expressing continued support for the UN Global Compact and  renewing our ongoing commitment to the initiative and its principles. This is separate from our initial letter of  commitment to join the UN Global Compact. • A description of practical actions (i.e., disclosure of any relevant policies, procedures, activities) that the  company has taken (or plans to undertake) to implement the UN Global Compact principles in each of the four  issue areas (human rights, labour, environment, anti-corruption). • A measurement of outcomes (i.e., the degree to which targets/performance indicators were met, or other  qualitative or quantitative measurements of results).

Since joining the UN Global Compact  in November 2020, the Calix Sustainable Development Team has  undertaken to review the Ten Principles, understand how the UN  Sustainable Development Goals  (SDGs) are connected, and set  priorities for our company. We use the Global Compact Management Model to help us assess  risks, opportunities and impacts linked  with the Ten principles.

By incorporating the Ten Principles of the UN Global  Compact into our strategy, policies and procedures,  not only is Calix upholding its basic responsibilities  to people and planet, but also setting the stage for  long-term success. At Calix, it’s not just about what we do, but also how  and why we do it.

ANTI-CORRUPTION COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS TO THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT 10  ===== PAGE 11 ===== Contributing to the  United Nations Sustainable  Development Goals Together with partners, we are working to increase the  efficiency and sustainability of our value chain, with the  understanding that sustainable development can only be  achieved by meeting ecological, economic and social targets  at the same time and in equal measure.  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS TO THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT 11  ===== PAGE 12 ===== What are the SDGs? The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent a  collective hope for a better future.  Adopted by 193 countries at the United Nations Sustainable  Development Summit in New York in September 2015, the  SDGs set out 17 global goals that together sketch a shared  blueprint for action on sustainable development.  These Global Goals call for worldwide action among  governments, businesses, and civil society to end poverty  and create a life of dignity and opportunity for all, within the  biophysical boundaries of the planet. Graphics by Jerker Lokrantz/Azote  The SDG ‘Wedding cake’ shows the biosphere as the foundation of economies and societies and as the basis  of all SDGs. This representation of the SDGs is more in line with a more recent (and scientific) version of  “sustainability”, where it is painted as integrated path where the economy serves society, so that it evolves  within the safe operating space of the planet.  It is becoming increasingly clear just how  important a role environmental and social  responsibility will play in the future of all  organisations. Acting responsibly is no  longer a choice. It is a business imperative  that will impact how you power your  operations, source raw materials, innovate  new products and protect your supply  chain against extreme weather and natural  disasters. Your decisions will affect the  wellbeing of your employees and influence  whether they want to work for you. Perhaps  most important, your approach to how you  run and build your business will be judged  by a new generation of consumers who  expect sustainable and ethical behaviour.

At Calix, we continuously ask the  following question of ourselves: with global climate, energy,  and sustainability issues set to intensify, how can we use our  technology, people and expertise to help solve the challenges   that are increasingly putting our planet at risk? During the last 12 months, our Sustainability Team conducted a  thorough review of all 17 SDGs, with the aim to understand better  our connection to the Goals, identify associated risks, and define  priority areas where we believe we can have the most meaningful  impact. Calix touches all 17 SDGs through innovation, development  and partnership initiatives, day-to-day operations, and social  investment opportunities. By aligning ourselves with the SDGs, we  are driven to make an impactful and more significant contribution  to Solving Global Challenges. This review, along with our commitment to the Ten Principles  set by the UN Global Compact, has set us on a path of corporate  social responsibility. It has also reaffirmed our commitment to  innovate and collaborate to continue to build a more sustainable  business model, while inspiring and helping all our stakeholders to  do contribute to a more sustainable future.  We hope this report will help you learn about the Global Goals  (SDGs) and some of the tangible actions behind our commitment  towards sustainability. We are committed to make all of the UN Sustainability Development  Goals (SDGs) part of our company culture and day-to-day operations,  and we see corporate social responsibility (CSR) as a journey towards  long-term growth, competitiveness, big picture thinking, strong  company culture, and a genuine team spirit.

Water COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS TO THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT 23  ===== PAGE 24 ===== Senator David Van and Calix CEO Phil Hodgson at the  official opening of the “BATMn” fully electrically-powered  Calix technology for producing advanced battery  materials in Bacchus Marsh on 21st November 2019 Energy accounts for around 60% of total global  greenhouse gas emissions. Increasing energy efficiency,  developing sustainable energy storage options and  the use of renewable energy is crucial to creating more  sustainable communities and businesses, and resilience to  environmental issues like climate change. By 2030, we need to substantially increase the share of  renewable energy in the global energy mix. Calix’s core technology is “energy agnostic”, which means  it can use both  low carbon fuels and renewable electricity.  An example is the LEILAC (Low Emissions Intensity Lime  and Cement) application, which is being developed to  reduce CO2 emissions from the production of cement and  lime. The industries together represent around 8% of  global CO2 emissions. The rapid shift needed towards renewable energy also  creates a global need for more efficient, cheaper,  higher-capacity, and more sustainable energy storage  options. Calix is developing advanced materials for  lithium-ion batteries, based on its nanoactive electrode  materials that have the potential to deliver superior  performance at a fraction of the cost, with improved  ease-of-recycling. In support of large-scale renewable energy storage, Calix  is also a consortium member of a 3-year EU Horizon 2020  project called SOlar Calcium-looping integRAtion for  ThermoChemical Energy Storage (SOCRATCES).  More recently Calix has teamed up with SaltX Technology  to build a unique salt-based energy storage system in  Sweden. This system that has great potential for load  balancing applications as the grid de-carbonises. Our ambitions • Scale our electric-powered Calix technology for  application in large industrial processes by 2024. • Accelerate our R&D on advanced battery materials, to  help facilitate the transition towards renewable energy in  the global energy mix. • Continue to leverage partnerships to facilitate research in  clean and renewable energy, and continue to improve the  energy efficiency of our technology. HIGH PRIORITY Affordable and clean energy Sustainable Development Goal 7 focuses on affordable and clean energy. It aims to “ensure access to affordable, reliable,  sustainable and modern energy for all.” COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS TO THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT 24  ===== PAGE 25 ===== Sustainable Development Goal 8 is about decent work and economic growth. It aims to “promote sustained economic  growth, higher levels of productivity and technological innovation.” Calix encourages suppliers, consultants and other business  partners within its sphere of influence to align with the  company’s Core Values, Code of Conduct and its standards for  health and safety, environment, quality assurance and training  and competence. Our ambitions • Embed respect for human and labour rights into everything  we do, and use our influence to contribute to a fairer, more  inclusive and more equitable way of doing business.  • Set the standard of workplace behaviour, through a revised  and more comprehensive Code of Business Conduct covering  the UN Global Compact’s Principles 1 to 6 on Human Rights  and Labour. Decent work and  economic growth COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS TO THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT 25  ===== PAGE 26 ===== Sustainable Development Goal 9 is about industry, innovation, and  infrastructure. It aims to “build resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable industrialisation and foster innovation.” Cement is the second-most widely used substance on the planet  (after water), fulfilling an essential role in providing society’s need for  housing and infrastructure. The cement and lime sectors are also responsible for around 8% of  global CO2 emissions. Calix’s LEILAC (Low Emissions Intensity Lime and Cement)  technology is being developed as a low cost CO2 mitigation  technology for these sectors. The LEILAC technology can separate  the CO2 emissions coming from the limestone itself (about 2/3 of  the total emissions from these industries), and is also able to be  renewably-powered, thus providing a potential zero-emissions  solution. Our ambitions After successfully piloting the LEILAC technology at a  HeidelbergCement plant in Belgium, Calix is leading a consortium of  some of the world’s largest cement and lime companies to scale the  technology, to help the industry achieve global carbon neutrality by  2050. More info: https://www.project-leilac.eu Calix is a key participant - as the core technology provider and project leader - in LEILAC (Low  Emissions Intensity Lime and Cement), a European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation  project that has successfully piloted the technology, and is now being scaled to help the cement and  lime industries reduce their CO2 emissions dramatically without significant energy or capital penalty. Industry, innovation and infrastructure COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS TO THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT 26  ===== PAGE 27 ===== Reduced inequalities Sustainable Development Goal 10 is about reduced inequality. It aims  to “reduce inequality within and among countries”. Calix supports WaterAid programs to facilitate access to safe water,  sanitation, and hygiene in the world’s poorest and most marginalised  communities. This partnership with WaterAid aligns perfectly  with our purpose and the reason why we exist, “We Solve Global  Challenges” and with our core value of “positive impact”. Calix offers a workplace-specific Indigenous cultural competency  online training to all employees.  Our ambitions • Set the standard of workplace behaviour, through a revised and  more comprehensive Code of Business Conduct covering diversity,  bullying, harassment and discrimination. We support COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS TO THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT 27  ===== PAGE 28 ===== Sustainable Development Goal 11 is about sustainable cities  and communities. It aims to “make cities inclusive, safe,  resilient and sustainable.” Climate change coupled with population growth results in  water and energy becoming increasingly critical challenges  for all cities and communities. We seek to develop and commercialise products and technologies that are aimed at helping to support the  creation of sustainable cities of the future. A growing sewer network creates issues such as  increased infrastructure maintenance, odour complaints  and potential health and safety hazards. Calix’s ACTI-Mag  and AMALGAM, two magnesium hydroxide slurries, can help  tackle these challenges, safely and cost-effectively, while  helping prevent pollution through more effective and safer  waste water treatment. While wastewater management and pollution prevention  are a priority, waste-to-energy programs are increasingly  needed to improve the productivity of treatment facilities  by maximising the economics of biogas generation from  anaerobic systems. Calix’s ACTI-Mag has been shown in  some systems to increase the quality and quantity of biogas  coming from anaerobic systems, and provide a significant  economic boost for food processing plants and water utilities. Energy accounts for around 60% of total global greenhouse  gas emissions. Increasing energy efficiency, developing  sustainable energy storage options and the use of  renewable energy is crucial to creating more sustainable  communities and businesses and resilience to environmental  issues like climate change. Calix is developing advanced  materials for lithium ion batteries that deliver superior performance at a fraction of the cost, with improved ease-of-recycling. Our ambitions • Help our customers continue to improve the sustainability  of waste water management, through the use of our  safer and more environmentally friendly water treatment  products. • Our Advanced Batteries business line is being developed  to help with the transition towards renewable energy, and  the ability of cities and communities to mitigate climate  change. Sustainable cities & communities COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS TO THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT 28  ===== PAGE 29 ===== Responsible consumption  & production Sustainable Development Goal 12 is about responsible consumption and production. It aims “to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.” At Calix, we acknowledge that unsustainable consumption and production habits are increasingly  putting our planet at risk. All Calix solutions - ACTI-Mag, BOOSTER-Mag and AQUA-Cal+ - are being developed with  efficiency in mind, to reduce the use of additional resources, while also enabling energy savings. Some examples: Calix magnesium hydroxide-based slurries are non-hazardous and they do not require sophisticated  equipment for application, which reduces hurdles for consumption and application. At Calix we find ways to encourage our people to consider how they consume resources both at  work and home and provide tips and guides as to how to minimise consumption and waste.  Calix solutions help our customers to manage chemicals and wastes, and significantly reduce the  release to air, water and soil, in order to minimize their adverse impacts on human healths and the  environment. Our ambitions • We will start to identify opportunities and measure progress to reduce our waste generation  through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse. “Be the change you want to see in the world.”  -Gandhi By implementing re-usable drinking bottles for all staff, we have saved 3,825  plastic bottles from landfill this year at our operations in Bacchus Marsh in 2021. COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS TO THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT 29  ===== PAGE 30 ===== The Paris Agreement on climate change  The historic Paris Agreement provides an opportunity for countries  to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change  by keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2  degrees Celsius and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature  increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. It entered into force on  4 November 2016. SDG impact to date Calix’s technology is also being developed and adapted to mitigate CO2 emissions in mineral and chemical processing,  and to develop advanced battery materials. Industrial CO2 mitigation  and enhancing the uptake of renewable energy  are both very important for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Cement is the second-most used substance on the planet (after water), fulfilling an essential role in providing society’s  need for housing and infrastructure. Lime is used in a variety of applications including in the iron & steel, chemical, paper  and pharmaceutical industries. Both sectors have relatively high carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and are responsible for  around 8% of global CO2 emissions. Nearly 2/3 of these CO2 emissions are released directly and unavoidably from the  processing of the raw material for cement and lime, limestone, which is roughly half by weight CO2. Calix aims to enable the cement and lime industries to capture those unavoidable CO2 emissions from the raw limestone.  Calix’s Technology engineers the existing process of a conventional kiln by indirectly heating the limestone via a special  steel reactor. This unique system enables pure CO2 to be captured as it is released from the limestone, without mixing  this CO2 with the kiln furnace gases (and thus making it very hard to capture) as happens in a conventional kiln. To quickly and effectively develop this technology, the European-Australian collaboration LEILAC (Low Emissions  Intensity Lime and Cement) projects include consortia of some of the world’s largest cement and lime companies, as  well as leading research and environmental institutions. Our ambitions • At Calix, we are developing our LEILAC technology as quickly as possible to help de-carbonise the cement and lime  sectors, with a commercial demonstration plant targeted for completion by end 2023 / early 2024, and our first full  scale plant by 2026/2027. • At Calix, we are developing our advanced battery technology as quickly as possible to help reduce cost and increase  safety, environmental impact and performance, with a commercial format demonstration cell using our cathode  materials targeted for completion and testing by end 2022. Climate action HIGH PRIORITY Sustainable Development Goal 13 is about climate action. It aims to  “take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts”.  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS TO THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT 30  ===== PAGE 31 ===== Sustainable Development Goal 14 is about life below water. It aims to “conserve and sustainably use the  oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.” Calix is developing solutions to help conserve our water and marine resources. Aquaculture is seen as a viable way to meet the growing demand for animal products globally with  more efficient use of resources than cattle or pig farming. However, aquaculture feed and waste  produce nitrogen and phosphorus, and the build-up of these elements in aqueous environments may  lead to negative ecological disruptions. If uncontrolled, the spread of algae could lead to the lead to  significant “fish kill” events and affect the biodiversity of ecosystems. To help, Calix has developed AQUA-Cal+, a water conditioner for aquaculture that helps maintain  good aquaculture pond health with reduced pond drainage, resulting in reduced “downstream”  pollution impacts also. Its high reactivity and surface area are proven to help prevent the buildup of  free ammonia and phosphate, which leads to blue-green algae runaways. AQUA-Cal+ is also being  developed for freshwater lake and pond remediation. AQUA-Cal+ enhances the productivity of aquaculture food farming. If practiced sustainably,  aquaculture can not only improve nutrition and food security in many parts of the world, but also help  restore habitat, replenish wild stocks, and rebuild populations of threatened and endangered species. Calix ACTI-Mag solutions can help reduce the amount of nutrients within wastewater from entering  our waterways. If not reduced, these nutrients can cause eutrophication in our rivers and coastal  areas, destroying wild life and natural habitats. ACTI-Mag is also safer and more environmentally  friendly than harsh chemicals, such as caustic soda, when used for alkalinity in waste water treatment. Our ambitions • Continue to advocate more sustainable aquaculture practices across South East Asia, such as the  ability to reduce aquaculture pond drainage when using AQUA-Cal+.  • Continue to advocate the replacement of harsh chemicals such as caustic soda as alkalinity agents  in waste water treatment.

COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS TO THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT 31  ===== PAGE 32 ===== Life on land Sustainable Development Goal 15 is about life on land. It aims to “protect, restore and  promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat  desertification, halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.” Population growth, a renewed focus on biofuels and on food quality and safety is putting  increasing pressure on agriculture. The need for innovative crop protection chemicals  that can at least sustainably maintain productivity and produce healthy and nutritious  food has never been greater. Calix is developing “BOOSTER-Mag”, a safe, environmentally friendly foliar spray,  that has demonstrated improved plant health and vitality, leading to higher yields in  magnesium poor soils as well as helping with pest management and fungal control.  A a non-lethal “repellent” of pests and disease, BOOSTER-Mag helps maintain biodiversity and beneficial insect populations. Our ambitions • Continue to develop and achieve registration for our safe and more  environmentally  friendly solutions for agriculture to reduce the use of harsh chemicals that can  degrade natural habitats, to prevent the loss of biodiversity in land and water  ecosystems. In 2020, we launched a ‘plant a tree’ campaign in Australia, facilitating the planting  of trees to help further mitigate the negative environmental consequences while  raising climate change awareness.  COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS TO THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT 32  ===== PAGE 33 ===== Sustainable Development Goal 16 is about peace, justice and strong institutions. It aims  to “promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access  to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.” At Calix, we are committed to a high level of governance, and highly value, excellent ethical standards, personal and corporate integrity and respect for others. Our business has adopted policies that set standards of behavior and reinforce  zero tolerance for behaviors such as corruption and bribery, workplace bullying and  violence and encourages the reporting of such acts with whistle-blower protection  policies. Calix’s Board is the body within Calix to which concerns about possible breaches of  Calix’s Code of Conduct can be reported. Referrals can be made by sending an e-mail  to info@calix.global or by sending an anonymous letter to: Calix Limited, 9 Bridge  Street, Pymble NSW 2073 – Australia. All such reporting is handled with discretion and  in a professional manner, with no retaliation imposed on those who report suspected  or unethical behaviour. Our ambition • Review our governance structure to bring more focus and accountability to ethical  and sustainable behaviour, including the establishment of a Board Sustainability  Committee. • Set the standard of workplace behaviour, through a revised and more comprehensive  Code of Business Conduct covering corruption, bribery and whistleblower protection.
