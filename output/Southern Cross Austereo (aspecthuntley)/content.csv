With persistently high  inflation and slowing economic conditions, broadcast advertising markets were  depressed for much of the year. Group revenue of $499.4 million was 1% below  FY23, and underlying group EBITDA of $66.2 million was 14.3% below FY23. Performance improved in the second half, driven by SCA’s continuing dominance  of the lucrative 25-54 audiences in metro and regional radio markets, improving  share of metro advertising revenue markets, strong growth in digital audio  revenues, and cost discipline. We are seeing this momentum gather pace in FY25.  Year In Review Despite challenging advertising market conditions, our improved financial  performance in the second half has provided strong momentum into  FY25. Our national leadership in the core buying demographics for men  and women aged 25-54 provides our sales teams with a strong platform  for continued growth into FY25.  In the fast-growing digital audio sector, LiSTNR reached over two million  signed-in and addressable users, with around one million of these  interacting with LiSTNR monthly. This is testament not only to the range of  engaging content on LiSTNR but also to the excellent and personalised  user experience the platform delivers.  The LiSTNR AdTech Hub is driving premium commercial returns for  our advertisers and driving growing interest. The LiSTNR AdTech Hub  enhances our advertisers’ ability to connect with relevant audiences on  LiSTNR and other digital audio distribution platforms.   Against the backdrop of inflationary pressures, we kept non-revenue- related costs to $308.4 million (excluding non-recurring items), and we are  activating further meaningful and permanent cost reductions for FY25.   We have re-commenced a strategic review of our non-core regional  television assets and are in active negotiations with several parties with  an interest in acquiring those assets. The sale of our regional television  assets will enable us to focus on optimising our leading radio and digital  audio assets, led by LiSTNR, HIT and Triple M.  Amounts stated to be ‘underlying’ exclude the $326.1 million ($228.3 million after tax) non-cash  impairment of the Broadcast Radio Cash Generating Unit (CGU) in FY24, and other significant items  in both periods relating to restructuring, corporate activity, and non-recurring items.  ===== PAGE 3 ===== 2024 Annual Report REGIONAL REGIONAL Total FM, AM and DAB+ audience Total Hit FM and DAB+ audience Total Triple M FM and   DAB+ audience Total TV reach Average monthly unique   radio streamers Average monthly streaming total  listening hours 8.71M* 5.80M* 4.61M* 3.29M** 1.75M*** 15.8M*** 7.27M^ 2.08M^^ Average monthly unique   podcast listeners Total LiSTNR signed-up users *Source: GFK Radio 360 Ratings, Total Radio.

Year In Review | 1   ===== PAGE 4 ===== Southern Cross Austereo 2 | Chairman’s Statement Chairman’s Statement I am honoured to present my first annual report to  shareholders as Chair of Southern Cross Austereo, having  taken over that role in March this year.  I would like to start by acknowledging the shareholder  journey and our disappointing performance for the past  year. We recognise that we must do better to position  Southern Cross Austereo as a leader in the Australian radio  and digital audio markets with enhanced profitable unit  economics and growth. The most recent financial year was a challenging one for  our company. With persistently high inflation and slowing  economic conditions, broadcast advertising markets were  depressed for much of the year. Group revenue of $499.4  million was 1% below FY23, and underlying group EBITDA  of $66.2 million was 14.3% below FY23. The company  recognised a non-cash impairment charge against the value  of broadcast radio licences of $228.3 million after tax. The  impairment reflects observed market pressures, independent  estimates of radio broadcast growth rates showing declines  over the forecast period and a consequent reduction in long- term growth rates. We also recognised a separate and higher  growth digital audio segment for the first time in FY24. We responded to these challenges with initiatives to  transform our operating model to capture a larger share of  available revenues while also completing our digitisation  capex program and resetting our cost base, and we expect to  see the benefits of these actions in future periods.   ===== PAGE 5 ===== 2024 Annual Report Chairman’s Statement | 3  Heith Mackay-Cruise Chair The Board decided not to pay a final dividend for FY24. While the  group’s leverage remains well within our banking covenants, the  Board considers that preserving cash to reduce the group’s net debt  is in the best interests of shareholders. The Board expects to maintain  this capital management position in FY25 while resuming payment of  dividends towards the lower end of the target payout range (65% to  85% of underlying net profit after tax).  During the year, we were disrupted by the non-binding indicative  proposal received in October 2023 from the Consortium of ARN  Media and Anchorage Capital Partners. The proposal was complex,  requiring the break-up of highly integrated radio and other assets of  SCA and ARN to re-allocate them to the members of the Consortium  and to a new digital joint venture. Most of the consideration for SCA  shareholders would have been shares in a reconstituted ARN which  was difficult to value. Our Board and executive team engaged with the  Consortium’s proposal for nearly seven months, only for the Consortium  to withdraw its proposal in May 2024. I expressed my frustration at the  time that the Consortium should have identified any potential material  concerns much earlier in the process. While our management team  did not lose focus on daily business activities during this process, it did  mean that some business transformation initiatives were paused or  slowed until the outcome of the Consortium’s proposal was known. Three longstanding Directors have retired from the Board this year.   My predecessor as Chair, Rob Murray, along with Glen Boreham retired  on 27 March 2024 and Helen Nash retired on 30 September. Each of  them served on our Board for around nine years during which they  made valuable contributions to the Board’s decision-making, as well  as being active on the Board’s committees. Helen chaired the Board’s  People and Culture Committee for three years, and Glen chaired the  Digital Transformation Committee for a similar period.  I would particularly like to acknowledge the contribution of Rob, who  became Chair in the middle of the lockdowns and other challenges of  the COVID-19 pandemic and led a process to refresh the Board and plan  for future succession. Rob also helped drive SCA’s executive succession  planning that has seen changes in the roles of CEO and several other  members of SCA’s senior leadership team in the past two years. We were delighted on 1 October to welcome Marina Go as a director  and as Chair of the People and Culture Committee. Marina brings  experience in executive and non-executive roles across a range of listed  and private companies in diverse sectors including media. As outlined in the report of our CEO, John Kelly, SCA is focused on  the future. Broadcast advertising markets remain inconsistent and  short, but we are well positioned to profitably grow our share of those  markets while we continue to lead the local market in the high-growth  digital audio sector. Our restructured commercial teams are consistently  growing SCA’s share of metro radio advertising revenues, and we  continue to connect advertisers to the largest radio audience in regional  Australia. We have completed our major digitisation capex cycle and are  seeing rewards from advertisers who can connect with targeted and  addressable audiences through LiSTNR.  Our regional television assets continue to operate profitably but are no  longer core to our audio-focused business. Shareholders will be aware  that we are in active negotiations with several parties with an interest in  acquiring those assets.  On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank our many stakeholders  including our people, advertisers, partners, and the communities we  serve around Australia for your ongoing support of SCA. In particular, I  extend my thanks to you, our shareholders, for your patience and trust  as we commit to delivering you improved returns in future periods.  I trust you will enjoy reading our annual report.  ===== PAGE 6 ===== Southern Cross Austereo 4 | CEO’s Report CEO’s Report We began the most recent financial year with a focus  on growing our share of available advertising markets,  improving our operating efficiency, and achieving  profitability with LiSTNR. After a lag in performance  during the first half of the year, we achieved many  of these goals and have carried positive operating  momentum into the first quarter of the new financial  year. Most notably, our commercial share of metro radio  advertising improved every month from December 2023  to June 2024, our digital audio revenue grew by 42%  year-on-year, and LiSTNR became EBITDA positive in the  final quarter of the year. Our business transformation  program has so far permanently removed more than  $30 million from our cost base. Despite these achievements, shareholders will be acutely aware that we fell  short of our revenue and profitability targets in FY24. Broadcast advertising  markets were especially challenging during the first half of the year, and it is  clear we need to continue to grow our share of those markets, exploit our  local leadership in digital audio markets, and transform our operating model  to further reduce our cost base and improve commercial returns. I am  confident we have the right strategy in place to do all those things.  SCA is all about audio. This includes broadcast and livestreamed radio,  music streaming, and on-demand podcasts.  Radio is a resilient and powerful medium. The Infinite Dial Australia study  in June 2024 found that 81% of Australians aged 12+ listen to radio each  week, compared to 77% who watch free-to-air television. SCA’s national  Triple M and Hit Networks have large and loyal audiences in the segments  that are most attractive to advertisers. In the most recent official metro radio  survey in August 2024, SCA’s metro stations recorded a total cumulative  audience of 5.881 million listeners (including DAB+). Our national Drive  show on the Hit Network, Carrie and Tommy, was number one nationally  in early Drive and, for the fourth survey in a row, number one in Melbourne  and Brisbane. The Fox was the most listened-to station in Australia and, for  the sixth survey in a row, the most listened-to station in Melbourne. B105  was the number one FM station in Brisbane for the fifth survey in a row,  Triple M was the number one FM station in Adelaide and its Breakfast show  topped the survey for the twelfth consecutive time. SCA is acutely focused on the audiences that matter to our advertisers. We  provide compelling content to our audiences and work with our advertisers  to provide meaningful commercial outcomes for them and for SCA. The audiences that matter to our advertisers in metro radio are the key  25-54 Men, Women and overall buying demographics, with over 70%  of agency briefs targeting these segments. For the last three years (25  consecutive surveys), our Networks have recorded the largest metro radio  audiences in these segments. Since changing our commercial leadership  and structures in 2023, we are increasingly converting our dominance of  these audiences towards a corresponding share of advertising revenues.  As mentioned earlier, we grew our commercial share of metro radio  advertising in every month from December 2023 to June 2024.  SCA has unrivalled reach in regional radio markets. Our Triple M and Hit  Network stations, along with partner radio stations for whom we provide  national sales representation, connect advertisers to 3.56 million listeners  in regional Australia. This scale is what matters to national advertisers in  regional Australia.  Our LiSTNR digital audio ecosystem is our growth engine. Just three years  since launch, it has become the leading local player in the fastest growing  advertising segment in Australia.   ===== PAGE 7 ===== 2024 Annual Report CEO’s Report | 5  John Kelly Chief Executive Officer and   Managing Director The 2024 Infinite Dial study found that 77% of Australians aged 12+  listen to digital audio each week, and 27% listen to livestreamed radio,  up from 15% in 2022. The study also found that 48% of Australians aged  12+ listen to podcasts each month, up from just 25% in 2020. We are  seeing similar and encouraging growth patterns on LiSTNR. We now  have over two million signed-up users, over half of whom interact  with LiSTNR each month. Stream starts on LiSTNR grew 17% and time  spent listening grew 7% during FY24. This is testament not only to the  range of engaging content on LiSTNR but also to the excellent and  personalised user experience delivered by LiSTNR. This growth in audience, coupled with our strategic investment in the  LiSTNR AdTech Hub, is driving inquiry from advertisers willing to pay  a premium to connect their messages to targeted and addressable  audiences. The LiSTNR AdTech Hub is now included in over 20% of  digital audio campaigns.  LiSTNR achieved revenues of $35 million in FY24 with year-on- year growth of 27% in the first half and 57% in the second half,  LiSTNR delivered positive EBITDA in the final quarter of the year  and is continuing that trajectory. With our major capex program now  complete, we forecast LiSTNR to be cash flow positive in FY25. Put  simply, SCA’s LiSTNR is Australia’s largest and fastest growing local  operator in the fastest growing segment in Australian media. Our regional television business dragged on our results again.  Television revenue declined by 8.7% to $97.5 million, and EBITDA  decreased by 28.9% to $13.3 million, although these declines slowed  in the second half of the year. We maintained tight cost controls but  are exposed to CPI cost escalation in broadcasting transmission and  playout contracts. We will actively progress opportunities to divest our  television assets in the coming months. I am excited about the opportunities ahead and confident that we  will deliver improved financial performance in FY25 and beyond.  We will continue to transform and optimise our audio operations to  drive efficiency with further meaningful and permanent reductions  to our cost base. Our Triple M and Hit radio networks have  strong content and engaged audiences, and a growing share of  commercial returns. LiSTNR has a high quality and diverse range  of livestreamed and on-demand podcast content and sophisticated  ad-tech capability to drive commercial returns for advertisers. With  our major capex cycle complete, we will improve the conversion of  our revenue to earnings and cash flow to de-leverage our balance  sheet and provide returns for shareholders. Finally, thank you to all our shareholders, advertisers, communities  and employees for your ongoing support.   ===== PAGE 8 ===== Southern Cross Austereo 6 | Operational Review Operational Review SCA’s mission is to entertain, inform and inspire Australians, anytime, anywhere.  In Triple M, Hit and LiSTNR, we have powerful brands with loyal audiences. We  aim to diversify and grow those audiences in segments that matter to advertisers  so that we earn a higher share of the available advertising revenue. Operational Review — Radio Radio revenue decreased by 1.6% to $366.6 million in FY24, due principally to an industry-wide decline of over 3% in metro markets. The impact on  SCA of this decline was mitigated by the resilience of our regional radio operations, which grew revenue by 0.8% for the year. The impact was also  mitigated by the improving performance of our metro sales team, which grew our commercial share of metro radio advertising in every month from  December 2023 to June 2024. The audience that matters to advertisers in metro radio is people aged 25-54. Over 70% of agency briefs target that audience, whether focused on  men, women, or all people. We build our metro radio shows with an acute focus on that audience. Our Hit Network stations focus on women aged  25-54, and our Triple M stations focus on men aged 25-54.  In metro survey 5/2024, SCA’s Networks recorded the largest national audience in the key 25-54 buying demographic for the 25th consecutive time  Our share of this audience grew in each survey over the past 12 months.  Individual show highlights included the consistent leading performance of Carrie & Tommy, our national Drive show on the Hit Network, and our  Breakfast shows on B105 in Brisbane, Triple M in Adelaide, and The Fox in Melbourne, which is Australia’s most listened-to radio station. 45% 25% 27% 34.1% 35.1% 36.91% 36.0% 39.2% 38.5% 37.4%3 7.6% 29% 31% 33% 35% 37% 39% 41% 43% S5 S6 S7 S8 S1 S2 S3 S4 SCA Network Commercial Audience Share M-Sun 0530-2400 Metro Markets (SMBAP) SCA People 25-54 SCA People 25-54 PCP 30% 20% Source: SCA Metro Radio Revenues / CRA Metro Radio Market Size 1 H2 Metro Radio Revenue Market Share 1 FY23 FY24  ===== PAGE 9 ===== 2024 Annual Report Operational Review | 7  In Sydney, Mick and MG have steadily built their Triple M Breakfast  audience over the past two years, particularly for men aged 25-54,  while 2DayFM continues to present opportunities for growth. We  recently farewelled Hughesy, Ed and Erin after three-and-a-half years  of waking up Sydney, and 2DayFM’s listeners now have Jimmy & Nath  for Breakfast, while Mike E & Emma have taken over national shifts on  Nights during the week and Breakfast on the weekend. Both shows  are well known to Sydney and national audiences, and we’re looking  forward to building their success.  Sport continues to be part of Triple M’s DNA, and we have been  delighted with the audiences for Triple M’s coverage of AFL and  NRL in the 2024 season. In metro survey 5/2024, Triple M had the  largest weekend radio audiences for AFL and NRL. And, after an  outstanding international cricket season in 2023/24, we were pleased  to reach agreement with Cricket Australia to extend our coverage of  international cricket in Australia until 2031.  The breadth of SCA’s networks distributing radio and digital  audio content to our audiences is a key differentiating factor for  advertisers. SCA has 10 metro radio stations and 78 regional radio  stations; in both cases, more than any other network. In metro  markets and some large regional markets, our Triple M and Hit  Networks also offer a suite of DAB+ music-focused stations. These  provide more choice for music fans and incremental audiences for  our advertisers. And all these stations are available around Australia  on our LiSTNR app and website. SCA has unrivalled scale and reach in regional radio markets, which  we call Boomtown. Our Triple M and Hit Network stations, along  with partner radio stations for whom we provide national sales  representation, connect advertisers to 3.56 million listeners in regional  Australia. With the addition of our representation of the ACE Radio  network, the reach of SCA’s regional audience has grown 25% in the  past five years. This scale, and the associated buying efficiency, is  what matters to national advertisers in regional Australia. 1.

An exciting outcome of our investment in LiSTNR over the past several years was  LiSTNR delivering positive EBITDA in the final quarter of FY24. This was driven by ongoing strong revenue growth: SCA has grown digital revenue at a  compound annual growth rate of 34% since FY20. Coinciding with launch of the LiSTNR AdTech Hub, digital revenue grew 57% year-on-year in the second  half of FY24. LiSTNR includes livestreams of our Triple M and Hit Network radio shows and live sports coverage, and a diverse range of owned and operated original  and radio podcasts created by LiSTNR in addition to supplied podcasts from global partners Wondery, NPR, the BBC and Sirius XM and domestic partners  Schwartz Media and DM Podcasts. The LiSTNR audience network reaches approximately seven million listeners on a monthly basis. Source: Australian Podcast Ranker, All Australian Top 200 Podcasts – July 2023 to May 2024.  ===== PAGE 12 ===== Southern Cross Austereo 10 | Operational Review Over two million people have chosen to sign in to the LiSTNR app, allowing  us to gain first-party data and create an addressable audience. This  provides us with an understanding of the audience profile and their listening  habits and strengthens sell-through with advertisers and known audience  for content creation. What matters to advertisers in digital audio is the ability  to target their messages with more certainty to relevant audiences. An important part of SCA’s digital audio strategy is to build not only the  quality and diversity of content available on LiSTNR but also the range  of digital audio content for which we provide sales representation. Our  podcast sales representation network is important because it includes  consumption of LiSTNR original and partner podcasts on all podcast  platforms in Australia (including, for example, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or  Amazon Music). This network maximises the reach of LiSTNR podcasts  for our creators, partners and advertisers. No matter where you hear an  advertisement in a LiSTNR original or partner podcast in Australia, the  advertisement will have been sold by our LiSTNR sales team. LiSTNR has consistently been Australia’s number one podcast sales  representation network as measured monthly by the Triton Australian  Podcast Ranker. In August 2024, the LiSTNR podcast sales representation  network had over 7 million listeners, providing highly meaningful scale for  our advertisers. Although we benefit from advertising impressions on all Australian  podcast platforms, it is important over time for us to grow the on-platform  audience for LiSTNR original and partner podcasts, because on-platform  listening provides deeper first-party data and insights to help advertisers  connect to addressable and targeted audiences at scale. Advertisers  will pay a premium to target their messages to known digital audiences,  rather than mass but unknown broadcast audiences.  In early 2024, we completed the major phase of investment to improve the  user experience on LiSTNR and our data analytics capabilities to optimise  the services we provide to listeners, media agencies and advertisers. For users, this upgrade streamlined navigation, simplified search, and  enhanced library and personalisation features to increase their frequency  of use and the time they spend on LiSTNR.  For advertisers, the upgrade enabled us to launch the LiSTNR AdTech  Hub, an advertising technology suite of services that facilitates  personalisation and targeting, dynamic creative optimisation, an  Australian based customer data platform, ad server and a range of first- party data solutions and services. Through a partnership with DataCo  Technologies, we have added a data cleanroom solution. This allows  advertisers to integrate their own databases with LiSTNR’s 2 million  first-party database and drive campaign effectiveness, while ensuring  security and privacy compliance. These innovations have seen the LiSTNR AdTech Hub now being  included in over 20% of digital audio campaigns.  ===== PAGE 13 ===== 2024 Annual Report Operational Review | 11  Operational Review – Television Regional television revenues continued to contract during FY24, driven especially by weakness in the national advertising market. SCA’s television  revenue declined by 8.7% to $97.5 million, reflecting an 11.5% drop in national revenue and a 9% decline in local revenue. Our television EBITDA of   $13.3 million was down by 28.9% on the previous year.  We continue to broadcast Network 10 programs in regional Queensland, southern New South Wales and Victoria and provide national advertising  sales representation for Network 10 programming in all Australian States and Territories, offering national advertisers a one-stop shop. We also  broadcast and provide sales representation for Seven Network programming in Tasmania, Darwin and Remote Central and Eastern Australia  and for Seven and Nine Network programming in Spencer Gulf and Broken Hill. As announced in August 2024, with the conclusion of recent corporate activity, we have re-commenced the strategic review of our regional television  assets. As a result of that review, we are in active negotiations with several parties with an interest in acquiring those assets. The sale of our regional  television assets will enable us to focus on optimising our leading radio and digital audio assets, led by LiSTNR, HIT and Triple M. *Note this map displays SCA owned television networks, joint ventures, and television products sold on behalf of non SCA networks.

We keep communities up to date on   issues that matter most to them, provide local skilled jobs, provide local advertising opportunities, and support local businesses, events,  charities, and community activities. A few examples of our active involvement with local communities are outlined below. Shepparton Foodshare Donation Drive Triple M Shepparton held a food drive live from our station to help  Shepparton Foodshare. Food insecurity in Australia is growing, and SCA  was proud to support Shepparton Foodshare to provide nutritious and  culturally appropriate food for those in need across the Goulburn Valley. Shepparton Foodshare Executive Officer, Glenn Peric said, “This is an easy  way for you to help spread some festive cheer to those less fortunate in  your own community and the radio station have made it easy to donate.” Bendigo and Ballarat Membership of local chambers of commerce and participation in their  annual awards provides valuable networking and business development  opportunities. SCA is a corporate sponsor of Commerce Ballarat and  Be.Bendigo, among other chambers of commerce, which provides  opportunities to showcase, celebrate and support local businesses and  contribute to our cities. As a sponsor of Be.Bendigo, SCA had an onstage  presence at the annual gala dinner and awards ceremony. Our audiences, employees, advertisers, communities and shareholders expect  us to prosper and deliver positive outcomes for them in a responsible way.  Sustainability is therefore a core business principle for SCA. We reach 95% of Australians through our radio, television and digital assets.   ===== PAGE 15 ===== 2024 Annual Report Sustainability at SCA | 13  Hobart In 2022, the Triple M Hobart team created a weekly segment to  spotlight the work of our charity partner, Make-A-Wish. Jordan Miller  was a ‘Wish Kid’ and, with remarkable honesty and grace, shared his  experience of being diagnosed with a brain tumour. Later in that year,  Jordan completed an exceptional work experience with SCA. Nearly two  years later in March 2024, we were delighted to welcome Jordan to a  permanent role as our Hobart receptionist.  Whyalla SCA is a proud partner of Whyalla Business and Tourism. At the annual  awards dinner, our local Senior Account Manager, Candice True,  presented awards to the winners of the Most Outstanding Business  of the Year and New Business of the Year.  Mt Gambier Ac.care has a mission for all country people to have a safe home,  enough money to live on and strong, positive relationships. They serve  the country communities of the Limestone Coast, Riverland, Murraylands,  Adelaide Hills and Fleurieu Peninsula. The Triple M and SAFM Limestone  Coast 2024 Blanket Appeal secured donations of more than 120  blankets and other winter warmers to help ac.care support vulnerable  people coping with cold winter conditions. Darwin Our 7 Darwin television office is a proud sponsor of McHappy Day,  raising money for Ronald McDonald House Charities, which support  families with seriously ill children. In November 2023, Anthony Harrison  and Kym Menzies from our 7 Darwin team volunteered to collect  donations at the local McDonald’s drive-through.   ===== PAGE 16 ===== Southern Cross Austereo SCA Embrace is our national charity framework which aims to make  a substantial difference to our Embrace partners by using our media  platforms to grow awareness of their work and amplify their messages.  We provide support through radio, digital and television advertising;  research support; event and meeting spaces; on-air interviews; and  staff volunteering. We partner nationally with selected charities for two-year cycles, and our  regional offices partner annually with charities in their communities. We continue to be very proud of SCA Embrace, a program that has now  provided more than $237 million of in-kind advertising to charities over  the past seven years in both metro and regional areas. Over the period from July 2021 to April 2023, SCA has supported 33  different local charities in our regional markets. We completed our two-year partnerships with Foodbank Australia and  Make-A-Wish on 31 December 2023 and kicked off new partnerships with  Cancer Council and Endometriosis Australia on 1 January 2024. During  FY24, we provided in-kind support to these partners of over $46 million: Testimonials Endometriosis Australia CEO, Maree Davenport  “Endometriosis Australia is extraordinarily grateful to SCA, and our  Embrace partnership will amplify the life-defining, painful symptoms   of endometriosis, which affects one in seven females and those   assigned female at birth (AFAB), based on those diagnosed by   44 to 49 years of age. “It is estimated that 14% of girls, women and AFAB in Australia live with  endometriosis. The average time between the onset of symptoms and  diagnosis is still between six and eight years, with access to surgical  treatment to diagnose and manage the condition taking even longer. With  SCA’s national reach across Australia, in rural and regional areas where  those living with endometriosis struggle to find timely and appropriate  medical care, Endometriosis Australia will change the narrative and SCA  will help change the lives of those with pelvic pain and endometriosis.”  Naomi Watson, Director, Marketing and Fundraising, Cancer Council “We are delighted to be partnered with SCA through the Embrace  program and have been thrilled with the results to date – after just six  months, the SCA team have secured over $7.5 million of value to Cancer  Council across Australia, an incredible result and one that will have a huge  impact in raising awareness  of our vital information and  support services, letting people  with cancer know that we  are here for them. Not only  this, but the partnership has  also allowed us to profile our  fundraising campaigns such as  Australia’s Biggest Morning Tea  and Daffodil Day, meaning we  can continue to raise funds to  ensure the continuity of these services into the future. Thank you so much  SCA team, you have been a joy to work with and we are looking forward  to continuing to do so for the remainder of the partnership.” Foodbank Australia CEO, Brianna Casey “The media partnership with SCA Embrace has been a game changer  for Foodbank. Now in our second year of the partnership, we can look  back and see tangible results from things such as the monthly CSA which  has amplified our key messages or boosted fundraising appeals. Having  this invaluable resource at the tips of our fingers over the past 18 months  has allowed us to grow our brand, raise awareness on food insecurity in  Australia and educate listeners on what we do, the impact we have and  how we are helping the many, many Aussies doing it tough right now as  we all battle against the cost-of-living crisis.  “We truly thank the entire SCA team, right around the country, for  supporting the work we do. SCA has given us the voice we needed  during times of disasters, times when we needed more support, or  simply the megaphone to direct people, who have never had to ask for  food relief before, where to go to find food. Thank you for giving us a  nationwide voice.” Make-A-Wish Australia CEO, Sally Bateman “The opportunity to be part of the SCA Embrace program has been a true  highlight again this year. The amazing support from the SCA team and  exposure across metro and regional Australia has helped to shine a bright  light on our wish program and raise important awareness for Make-A- Wish about critically ill kids and the lasting impact of wishes. Over the past  12 months, we’ve seen a record number of applications into our program.  We are delighted to be currently supporting our largest ever number  of kids on their wish journey and to be delivering a growing number of  wishes every day to critically ill children. “We really can’t thank SCA enough for everyone’s wonderful support. We  remain enormously grateful for the team’s help not only in providing a  platform for our wish families and kids to share their important stories, but  also in connecting us to a new generation of givers. The cross-platform  support of our signature fundraising events – Wear it Blue to Make  Wishes Come True, and Hungry Jack’s Wishmaker Month, will allow us  to create more incredible experiences for the wish kids it’s our privilege  to support and ensure there’s moments to look forward to, moments that  can be treasured forever by a growing number of Australian families.” 14 | Sustainability at SCA SCA Embrace Foodbank Australia $13.0 million Make-A-Wish $17.7 million Cancer Council $7.9 million Endometriosis Australia $7.8 million  ===== PAGE 17 ===== 2024 Annual Report Sustainability at SCA | 15  State Market Charity name ACT Canberra Ronald McDonald House NSW Albury The Men’s Table  Central Coast Coast Shelter Dubbo Veritas House Orange Orana Support Services Wagga Wagga Wagga Women’s Health Centre  QLD Cairns Stay In The Fight Gold Coast Gold Coast Community Fund Mackay Trudy Crowley Foundation Ltd Cairns Cairns Couch Ltd Rockhampton / Gladstone / Emerald Fitzroy Community Hospice Sunshine Coast IFYS Toowoomba Sunrise Way Townsville Fuel For Schools Ltd TAS Hobart Beacon Foundation VIC Ballarat Foodbank Gippsland Foodbank Mildura Sunraysia Cancer Resources Shepparton Shepparton Foodshare Inc Regional Embrace In FY24, our regional markets delivered value-in-kind of over $1 million in aggregate to the following local charities.

From fostering a collaborative and supportive culture to keeping our  team safe, healthy and well, we are committed to supporting every member of our team to thrive.

For Harmony Week, we encouraged our markets to celebrate cultural  diversity at a local level, and we saw almost all offices participate through  activities such as hosting multicultural lunches or morning teas and  creating space for employees to share their cultural backgrounds. For International Women’s Day, we announced that SCA will   become Australia’s first accredited ‘Endo Friendly’ employer.  We are working towards this accreditation with our Embrace  partner, Endometriosis Australia.  In June 2024, we held a Masterclass to educate our people on the history  and significance of Pride Month, the meaning of gender identity and the  importance of allyship. We have introduced the option for employees to  include their gender pronouns in email signatures as a sign of allyship and  to avoid mistaken gender assumptions. In FY25, we will implement a new human resources information system  that will enable us to improve collection of data about our workforce, to  set diversity targets beyond gender, to establish programs to grow and  support under-represented groups and to support our people to do their  best work for SCA. In April 2022, SCA became a signatory to the 40:40 Vision, strengthening  our commitment to achieving gender balance (40:40:20)2 in executive  leadership by 2030. The following tables summarise the composition of  SCA’s workforce on 31 March 2024, which is the reporting date for the  Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA). We do not yet have reliable  information about employees who do not identify as male or female,  although the information below excludes the employees who have  informed us of such identity.  ===== PAGE 20 ===== Southern Cross Austereo 18 | Sustainability at SCA Gender pay gap In February 2024, WGEA for the first time published data about the  gender pay gap in individual Australian private sector employers  with over 100 employees. WGEA’s target is for employers to have a  median gender pay gap of between -5% and +5%. WGEA found that  30% of employers fall into this range, while the median gender pay  gap in Australia is 19%. WGEA found that SCA had a median gender pay gap of 5.6% for  base salary and 5.9% for total remuneration. While these results were  just outside WGEA’s target range, they compared favourably to the  results in our broadcasting industry group which had median gender  pay gaps of 25.3% for base salary and 27.2% for total remuneration.  Bringing our gender pay gap into WGEA’s target range is an objective  of our Diversity and Inclusion Strategy.  Workplace health and safety SCA’s Board has adopted a Workplace Health and Safety Policy confirming  that SCA has no tolerance for harm, either physical or psychological, to our  employees or other people because of SCA’s operations. Conducting stunts, events and promotional activities is an important part  of our commercial activities. Our teams prepare specific risk assessments  for these activities to ensure appropriate steps are taken to mitigate the  associated risks. Selected WHS statistics for the most recent 12 months ended 31 March  are provided below. The number of lost days increased year-on-year  principally due to four psychosocial claims that resulted in lengthy  absences from work. In response to these claims and the Respect@Work recommendations  arising from the National Inquiry into Sexual Harassment in Australian  Workplaces, we refreshed our approach to managing psychosocial hazards  in our workplace. Some of the risks we identified in our business were: •	Job demands associated with short deadlines and reductions in the size  of our workforce •	Remote or isolated work, both in regional and remote offices but  also associated with the increasing take-up of working from home  opportunities •	Harmful behaviours, particularly at events where alcohol is consumed •	Traumatic events or materials, such as in news and investigative reporting  and in dealing with distressed callers to late night radio shows.  We have updated the resources available to our teams to manage these  risks. These resources include bespoke training for location managers,  additional mental health resources through our Employee Assistance  Program provider, and business-wide webinars focused on strategies for  resilience, recovery and recharging. Learning and development We are committed to providing our leaders and teams with meaningful  and impactful learning opportunities that facilitate growth, development  and expertise. After consulting widely with leaders, we have developed a  learning and development strategy including the following themes: •	Leadership development for functional managers to support internal  succession planning •	Negotiating and influencing skills for sales and other teams •	Creative thinking and storytelling for sales and content teams. Our curriculum includes a Mini MBA program for 50 participants selected by  application and facilitated by the Australian Institute of Management; access  for all our people to LinkedIn Learning; externally facilitated team dynamics,  negotiation, sales and executive coaching programs; creative thinking and  storytelling workshops; an internal mentoring program; and bootcamps  covering fundamental skills in content creation and sales. Optimising productivity After corporate instability and challenges in advertising markets during  the year, we observed a reduction in employee engagement, job security  and attendance in our offices, with potential adverse implications for  productivity. In recent months, we have implemented a range of actions  to address these concerns including business-wide presentations and  workshops on our strategy, review of our employee benefits suite and  launch of our revitalised learning and development strategy. On 1 September 2024, we launched a three-month trial of a nine-day  fortnight in three locations. The success of the trial will be measured against  target improvements in sales, employee turnover, office attendance,  productivity, and employee engagement survey results. After review of the  results of the trial, a decision will be made whether to proceed with a wider  roll-out of a nine-day fortnight. Acknowledging the importance to our business of collecting and using data  about our audiences, advertisers, employees and suppliers, and their use  of our systems and services, we aim to earn their trust for us to responsibly  collect, manage and secure the personal information and other confidential  data they share with us. We have comprehensive measures to provide a  secure and resilient technology environment, coupled with a commitment  to continuous improvement. The first layer of protection is to collect and retain only the data we need  for our business purposes. Controlling the volume and nature of the data  we collect, and securely destroying or anonymising the data we no longer  need, reduces the risk of the data being attractive to cyber hackers.  We measure our cyber security posture against a range of metrics and  report on our performance to each meeting of the Board’s Audit and  Risk Committee. Significant achievements during FY24 included material  progress in rationalising the number of our computer servers, closing all  findings from regular penetration testing, enhancing cyber risk awareness  training for employees, and regularly assessing the cyber security maturity  of contractors and software vendors that require access to our systems. Like many Australian businesses, our Australia-wide radio networks were  affected by the CrowdStrike incident on the afternoon of 19 July 2024. Our  crisis management and technology teams responded quickly to ensure  that night’s AFL and NRL matches went live on air as scheduled, while  all stations were back on air within 22 hours and with negligible loss of  advertising revenue. The incident, while challenging and providing valuable  lessons, demonstrated the robustness of our technology infrastructure,  teams, and response capability.

This is reflected in our Climate Change Policy which sets a  foundation for building our understanding of the risks and  opportunities presented by climate change and how we will  respond to those risks and opportunities. For the past two years, we have compiled a greenhouse gas (GHG)  emissions inventory for our business. In FY24, 79% of SCA’s total  GHG emissions of 26,255 tCO2-e were in Scope 3.  The table below summarise SCA’s GHG emissions inventory for  FY24 with a comparison to FY23. Our GHG emissions in FY24 were lower than in FY23 by 6.2%.  In some categories, year-on-year changes have resulted from  improved measurement, for example where we have been able to  move from reliance on applying emissions cost factors to general  ledger expenditure to calculation of actual energy use. Notably,  we recorded materially higher Scope 2 emissions from purchased  electricity. We will investigate in the new year whether this was a  result of improved measurement or other factors in the way we  conduct our business. Because of the corporate activity during the year, we deferred  some planned initiatives to support enhanced measurement and  recording of our GHG emissions and to reduce those emissions.  Had the corporate activity proceeded, the acquirers would have  been responsible for implementing appropriate initiatives for these  purposes. We will revisit those initiatives in the new year. Mandatory climate-related financial reporting Australia’s first mandatory climate reporting regime will come  into effect on 1 January 2025, and the Australian Accounting  Standards Board has produced an exposure draft of the Australian  Sustainability Reporting Standards setting out the detail required  to be included in the climate statements produced by reporting  entities. During the year ahead, we will monitor the issue of the Australian  Sustainability Reporting Standards to be well prepared to  commence climate-related financial reporting when required  and will consider voluntary disclosures in the meantime.

Directors’ Report The Directors of Southern Cross Media Group Limited (‘the  Company’) submit the following report for Southern Cross Austereo,  being Southern Cross Media Group Limited and its subsidiaries  (‘the Group’) for the year ended 30 June 2024. Directors The following persons were Directors of the Company during the  whole of the year, unless otherwise stated, and up to the date  of this report: –	 Rob Murray (Chairman until 27 March 2024) –	 Heith Mackay-Cruise (Chairman from 27 March 2024) –	 John Kelly (Managing Director) –	 Glen Boreham (Retired 27 March 2024) –	 Carole Campbell –	 Ido Leffler –	 Helen Nash Principal activities The principal activities of the Group during the course of the  financial year were the creation of audio content for distribution on  broadcast (AM, FM and DAB radio) and digital networks. The Group  also broadcasts free-to-air television content in regional markets.  All of these media assets are monetised via revenue generated  from the development and sale of advertising solutions for clients. There were no changes in the nature of the Group during the  full year. Review and Results of Operations Operating and Financial Review Group Results The Group’s results for the year ended 30 June 2024 are  summarised in the table below: Total Revenue 2024 $’m 2023 $’m Variance $’m % Broadcast radio 366.6 372.6 (6.0) (1.6)% Digital audio 35.0 24.6 10.4 42.2% Television 97.5 106.7 (9.2) (8.6)% Corporate 0.3 0.4 (0.1) (25.5)% Total Revenue 499.4 504.3 (4.9) (1.0)% Total Expenses Broadcast radio (279.4) (274.7) (4.7) 1.7% Digital audio (45.9) (42.2) (3.7) 8.8% Television (84.2) (88.0) 3.8 (4.3)% Corporate (23.7) (22.2) (1.5) 6.8% Total Expenses excluding  significant items1 (433.2) (427.1) (6.1) 1.4% EBITDA Broadcast radio 87.2 97.9 (10.7) (10.9)% Digital audio (10.9) (17.6) 6.7 38.0% Television 13.3 18.7 (5.4) (28.9)% Corporate (23.4) (21.8) (1.6) 7.1% EBITDA excluding  significant items1 66.2 77.2 (11.0) (14.2)% Reported Group NPAT (224.6) 19.1 (243.7) (1,275)% 1	 EBITDA disclosed within the Directors’ Report is equivalent to ‘Profit/ (loss) before income tax expense for the year from continuing operations’  included within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income  after adding back depreciation and amortisation expense, significant items,  and net interest expense. EBITDA is used by the Directors as a widely  recognised measure of operational performance. Group revenues decreased by 1.0% on prior year with declines in  broadcast radio and television partially offset by increased digital  audio revenue. Total expenses increased by 1.4%. Revenue related  expenses were flat despite the fall in revenue as additional costs  were incurred to support listener and revenue share growth.  Tight cost control saw non-revenue related (NRR) expenses  excluding significant items increase by only 2.5%, below the level  of inflation. The combination of lower revenues and increased  expenses resulted in a 14.2% decline in EBITDA to $66.2 million  excluding significant items. 2024 Annual Report Directors’ Report | 27  Directors’ Report For the year ended 30 June 2024  ===== PAGE 30 ===== Significant Items At 30 June 2024, the Group recognised an impairment of  $326.1 million in the carrying value of radio broadcast licences  in the broadcast radio cash generating unit. There was also a  related derecognition of a deferred tax liability in respect of those  licences for $97.8 million, giving a $228.3 million impairment charge  net of tax. The impairment reflects observed market pressures,  independent estimates of radio broadcast growth rates showing  declines over the forecast period, and a consequent reduction in  the long-term growth rates. Significant items also included $2.9 million ($2.0 million post tax)  relating to the response to corporate activity proposals, $4.5 million  ($3.1 million post tax) of restructuring costs relating to a significant  cost-out programme and $3.3 million ($2.3 million post tax) of other  items which included the write-off of certain development costs. In the prior year, $4.0 million of significant items relating principally  to restructuring costs were included in net profit before tax  ($2.8 million post tax). Broadcast Radio The Broadcast Radio business consists of two complementary  radio networks operating across Australian capital cities and  regional Australia. Each network’s brands target different audience  demographics with the Triple M network skewed towards males  in the 25 to 54 age bracket and the Hit Network targeted towards  females in the 25 to 54 age bracket. Broadcast Radio   Profit & Loss 2024 $’m 2023 $’m Variance  $ % Metro Radio  Advertising Revenue 181.1 186.2 (5.1) (2.7)% Regional Radio  Advertising Revenue 163.1 162.0 1.1 0.7% Other Revenue 22.4 24.4 (2.0) (8.2)% Total Revenue 366.6 372.6 (6.0) (1.6)% Revenue  Related Expenses (71.2) (68.5) (2.7) 3.9% Non-Revenue Related  (NRR) Expenses (208.2) (206.2) (2.0) 1.0% Total Expenses (279.4) (274.7) (4.7) 1.7% EBITDA excluding  significant items 87.2 97.9 (10.7) (10.9)% Total Broadcast radio revenues decreased by 1.6% to  $366.6 million. The Group’s metro radio advertising revenue  decreased by 2.7% largely as a result of a 3.1% decline in the overall  market. SCA’s average revenue metro market share increased to  27.2% in line with an improvement in audience ratings, which saw  consecutive monthly improvements in revenue market share in  the second half of the year to June 2024. The Group’s regional  advertising radio revenue increased by 0.7%, due to strong local  sales which increased by 4.0%, highlighting the benefit of the  Group’s diverse customer base. Revenue related costs increased from 18.4% of revenues in FY2023  to 19.4% in FY2024. This increase was due to additional costs to  support revenue share growth, including content, sales activations,  increased promotions and outside broadcast activity, together  with additional sales incentives. NRR expenses increased by only  1.0% due to tight cost control largely offsetting the impact of high  inflation and strategic investments in revenue-driving technology. As a result of the decline in revenue and increase in costs,  Broadcast radio EBITDA fell 10.9% to $87.2 million.  Digital Audio The Digital Audio business consists of the Group’s digital  platform, LiSTNR and the digital assets associated with the Radio  broadcasting business. Digital Audio   Profit & Loss 2024 $’m 2023 $’m Variance  $ % Total Revenue 35.0 24.6 10.4 42.2% Revenue  Related Expenses (7.4) (6.3) (1.1) 17.5% Non-Revenue Related  (NRR) Expenses (38.5) (35.9) (2.6) 7.2% Total Expenses (45.9) (42.2) (3.7) 8.8% EBITDA excluding  significant items (10.9) (17.6) 6.7 38.0% Group Digital Audio revenues increased by 42.2% to $35.0 million  driven by strong performance in InStream and Podcast revenue.  LiSTNR continued to grow strongly in FY2024, with strong  adoption by users attracted to the compelling product and  the increasing choice of content. Total listenership of SCA and  partner Digital Audio content measured across all digital platforms  exceeded 10 million listeners on a monthly basis, and the number  of listeners who have signed-up with LiSTNR now exceeds  2 million users. SCA anticipates strong digital audio growth will  continue into FY2025. Revenue related expenses fell from 25.6% of revenue in FY2023 to  21.1% in FY2024 as a result of economies of scale. NRR expenses  increased by 7.2% due to strategic investments in revenue-driving  technology, notably the implementation of the LiSTNR Customer  Data Platform. The combined impact of strong revenue growth with  relatively modest expense increases resulted in a 38.0% reduction  in the EBITDA loss to $(10.9) million, with EBITDA breaking even in  the last quarter of FY2024. Southern Cross Austereo 28 | Directors’ Report Directors’ Report For the year ended 30 June 2024  ===== PAGE 31 ===== Television The Television business consists of 96 regional television licences.  Each regional television licence receives programming from a  metropolitan television network affiliate. During the financial year  the Group received the majority of its programming from the  Ten Network in the 3-AGG market, whilst Tasmania, Darwin and  Central licence areas received Seven Network programming. Television   Profit & Loss 2024 $’m 2023 $’m Variance  $ % Total Revenue 97.5 106.7 (9.2) (8.6)% Revenue  Related Expenses (46.0) (51.4) 5.4 (10.5)% Non-Revenue Related  (NRR) Expenses (38.2) (36.6) (1.6) 4.4% Total Expenses (84.2) (88.0) 3.8 (4.3)% EBITDA excluding  significant items 13.3 18.7 (5.4) (28.9)% Total Television revenues decreased by 8.6% to $97.5 million,  with the advertising markets down 5.3% and SCA’s market share  in the 3-AGG market (comprising the Queensland, Southern New  South Wales and Victoria television markets) declining largely  due to continuing falls in affiliate network ratings and increased  competitive pressure particularly in relation to integrated national  sales. Revenue related costs decreased in line with the fall in  revenue and non-revenue related expenses rose due to CPI- linked broadcast contract costs. As a result EBITDA fell by 28.9%  to $13.3 million. Corporate The Corporate function comprises the Group-wide centralised  functions that cannot be clearly attributable to the Broadcast  Radio, Digital Audio or Television operating segments. Corporate  expenses increased by 6.8%, mainly due to inflation linked  contracts and further centralisation of functions for longer  term efficiency.  Group financial position The Group has generated positive operating cashflows  throughout the year. The increase in interest rates since May 2022 resulted in higher  net interest payable to banks of $6.9 million (2023: $4.7 million).  The combination of the higher net interest payable and reduced  EBITDA saw the Interest cover decrease to 8.30 times from  15.09 in June 2023 – though remaining well above the minimum  Interest cover covenant of 3.0 times. Similarly, the Group’s key  leverage ratio increased to 1.87 times, up from 1.48 times in June  2023 – whilst higher, it remains well within the maximum covenant  requirement of 3.5 times. The Group’s debt facilities mature in January 2026, with  $160 million of commitments. The Group has gross debt of  $118 million at 30 June 2024, with a further $42 million available to  draw upon, providing security of financing into the medium term.   Additionally, the Group has access to a short-term $25 million  overdraft facility with the ANZ Banking Group, renewable annually  on each 30 April. Strategic update The Group’s mission is ‘To entertain, inform and inspire  Australians. Anytime. Anywhere.’ with a sharpened focus on  being Australia’s leading Audio company, and a particular emphasis  on the growing Digital Audio sector, the Group will leverage its  national digital and broadcast network and audio ecosystem to  maximise total shareholder returns for investors. In FY21 the Group developed a new and refreshed Corporate  Strategy focused on our four key strategic pillars: 1.	 Diversify and grow monetisable audiences 2.	 Evolve and scale the LiSTNR ecosystem 3.	 Achieve audio market revenue leadership 4.	 Refine and evolve the Group’s operating model This strategy provides an overall strategic pathway for the Group  until June 2026. The six-year strategy includes specific objectives  and targets across three 2-year horizons. The Group is in the last  of these 2-year horizons, where our focus will be on realising the  inherent potential of our now enhanced audio assets to grow cash  flows, in order that we can: 1.	 Effectively monetise the ‘audiences that matter’ and improve  earnings across all assets and all markets 2.	 Develop LiSTNR so that it provides a significant contribution to  revenue, earnings and operating cash flows 3.	 Proactively evolve our operating model to be efficient, agile and  drive improved performance across broadcast and digital ﻿2025 outlook The Group continues to sharpen its focus on being the Audio  leader in Australia, for broadcast – both live and on-demand –  and podcasting by continuing to grow Digital Audio with SCA’s own  and partner content as an increasingly material augmentation to the  nation’s widest-reaching and most engaging audio business. The Group maintains a highly competitive position in traditional  radio (licences), which in combination with our in-house production  capability, high calibre representation agreements and market- leading data and insight capabilities, will continue to provide an  increasing audience and understanding from which to drive Digital  Audio. Whilst currently almost 9% of audio revenues, the premium  that Digital Audio attracts through the ability to target audiences on  its platform is expected to continue to attract an improved valuation  multiple and broader range of addressable markets thereby  providing greater rates and on-going growth potential. Overall, the Group is looking in FY25 to: –	 Effectively monetise the ‘audiences that matter’ in each  segment to improve earnings across all assets and markets in  which we participate –	 Leverage long-term investment; audiences built and growing;  and our leading position with LiSTNR to build on the EBITDA  profitability achieved, such that it meaningfully contributes to  revenue and earnings, with LiSTNR expected to be cash flow  positive in FY25 –	 Continue to evolve our operating model to be ever more  efficient, agile and effective across both broadcast and digital  thereby prioritising earnings; and deliver FY25 Non-Revenue  Related costs below FY24 costs, which were $309 million  excluding significant items –	 Actively progress the divestment of its Television assets –	 Reduce capital expenditure to approximately $10 million –	 Pay dividends towards the lower end of the target payout range  of between 65% to 85% of NPAT 2024 Annual Report Directors’ Report | 29   ===== PAGE 32 =====  Material Risks Business and operational risks that could affect the achievement of the Group’s financial prospects include the following risks: Risk Mitigation Strategies LiSTNR product does  not reach sustainable  profitability at an  appropriate level  and pace SCA has core expertise in the development of market leading content and constantly reviews the evolving  distribution landscape to understand how it can continue to serve market leading content through new and  innovative products. Consumption of digital audio continues to grow strongly, with 77% of Australians 12+ listening to online audio  each week, up from 66% in 2021, which goes up to 84% for the age 35-54 demographic and to 93% in the under  35s1. This is expanding the range of audio content and diversifying the ways in which audio can be consumed. LiSTNR is a curated and personalised app offering radio, podcasts, music and news that is a key element of  SCA’s digital transformation. LiSTNR features all of SCA’s existing digital content plus a huge range of new and  compelling premium content, all contained in one free and easy to use app. Since launch in February 2021, over 2 million users have signed-up to LiSTNR with 0.5 million of those in  FY2024, resulting in significant, growing audio consumption through the product and generating first-party data  from our signed-in audience that gives SCA enhanced ability to offer our clients targeted, engaged audiences  at scale. This targeted advertising is enabled by an Instream advertising product, which also delivers it across  the digital inventory of SCA’s partners such as SoundCloud. In April, the Group launched the LiSTNR AdTech Hub to deliver increased personalisation and targeting,  dynamic creative optimisation and an Australia-based Customer Data Platform with associated first party data  clean room solutions and services. Together these innovative technology capabilities and services deliver  exciting and effective advertising outcomes and set LiSTNR apart as the most advanced, data led and privacy  compliant digital audio platform for brands in 2024. This has been reflected in more than 20% of Digital Audio  sales now being AdTech supported with increases in revenues. SCA believes it will be able to offer its listeners compelling content across the medium of their choice –  being Broadcast Radio or Digital Audio. The bulk of the investment in digitisation is now complete with any  further resources being deployed towards developments that will provide greater monetisation opportunities  for LiSTNR and its market leadership in terms of content depth and quality, product capability, and digital  sales expertise. Revenues for Broadcast  Radio grow more slowly  than forecast SCA is a member of Commercial Radio & Audio (‘CRA’), which represents the interests of commercial radio  broadcasters throughout Australia. CRA has improved the accuracy and trust in the survey measurements it  commissions including the introduction of additional surveying methodologies. Further, SCA has developed  attribution tools to provide enhanced comparability with global technology solutions, which have been  attracting revenue away from traditional media. As described above, SCA has developed LiSTNR to take advantage of the increased consumption in Digital  Audio. As well as offering live radio, catch-up radio podcasts are available – in combination this is the majority  of listening hours on LiSTNR. SCA believes that as a result of its investment in the AdTech hub, it will be  able to offer and target audiences ever more effectively with content across the medium of their choice –  either Broadcast Radio or Digital Audio, which will mitigate the impact of any reduction in Broadcast Radio  growth alone. Global technology  companies participate  more aggressively in the  Audio market, making  SCA’s distribution less  profitable or increasing  subsidy from other  business lines SCA has a core expertise in content creation and is focused on providing localised content as a key  differentiator to international operators to ensure it receives strong engagement and listening from its customer  base across all of its platforms and environments. SCA launched LiSTNR in February 2021 and though the major development investment is effectively complete,  SCA continues to develop the product so that it directly attracts and retains listeners and establishes itself  as a destination for audio listening, providing a significant signed-in user base that enables SCA to compete  effectively in providing digital advertising solutions. The Group’s team of digital experts are integrated into the Group’s day-to-day operations and analytical teams  in order to leverage existing content and sales capabilities. SCA aims to continue to grow market share quickly with LiSTNR, so that it builds and retains a strong, engaged,  loyal audience that can compete with both domestic and international competitors. LiSTNR’s podcasting and  streaming monthly audience was above 8 million listeners in June 2024, retaining its number 1 position as  Australia’s largest podcast network2. The Group invests in engaging digital audiences through the simulcast of its FM radio stations online and the  creation of additional stations on DAB that extends its brands across broadcast and online platforms. This  is coupled with a large range of digital only content that ensures the LiSTNR product has a deep and often  exclusive content offering for users. SCA utilises its own media assets as well as paid media to drive both  awareness and adoption of LiSTNR to build a strong market position. Southern Cross Austereo 30 | Directors’ Report Directors’ Report For the year ended 30 June 2024  ===== PAGE 33 ===== Risk Mitigation Strategies Revenues from a  declining regional TV  market decrease faster  than forecast In FY24, the Group saw a decline in its television revenues of 8.6% year on year, due to market declines  and competitive pressures. Although FTA television continues to deliver scale audiences and retains a  key place in media buying strategies, the economics of FTA television remain challenging due to ongoing  audience declines. Key mitigation strategies are focused on improving the share of media spending directed towards regional  markets (which have historically lagged metro market behaviour); focusing on the efficiency of our television  operations; and accelerating the shift of the Group’s sales emphasis towards audio. The Group’s sales teams’  Regional Development Program continues to drive incremental marketing in regional markets where there is  an underinvestment in media spend on a per capita basis; and is supported in this regard by the industry trade  marketing Boomtown campaign. The Group is a diversified business covering television, radio and online, which provides a degree of protection  against individual market weaknesses, with television representing around 15% of the Group’s EBITDA (prior  to corporate costs) and declining. As a television affiliate the Group pays a percentage of revenue to program  supply partners resulting in a more variable cost structure than our radio or online businesses, thereby reducing  the profit impact of declines in FTA television revenue. SCA strategically is committed thematically to being ‘all about Audio’ and accordingly will continue to look to  reduce its exposure to the TV ad market through the sale of its licences should economic opportunities to do  so arise. Operational impact of a  cyber security breach A security breach could result in loss of content playout; compromise of secondary supporting systems or the  operational platform; or lead to a data breach. The Group is measuring and maturing its information security management system against the internationally  recognised NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) cybersecurity framework. The Group has commissioned ongoing cyber vigilance for malware, spam and phishing attempts. Regular  penetration and breach testing is conducted, and breach simulations are performed regularly with outcomes  reported to management and Directors. The Group has engaged CyberCX for Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) services, including  proactive threat hunting and break-glass digital forensics in the event of a major incident. Additionally,  Telstra Purple provides Security Operations Centre (SOC) services, enhancing the Group’s monitoring  and incident response capabilities. User education on Cyber Security has been uplifted through friendly  phishing campaigns, in-person awareness sessions, and mandatory annual compliance training. Multifactor  authentication is applied to all users, including executives and privileged user accounts. The Group maintains a  Cyber Security insurance policy. The Group has outsourced its transmission to Broadcast Australia and TV playout to NPC Media, which has  disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place, that are periodically tested to ensure continuity of its  services in case of a security breach or other interruption. Systems security questionnaires are completed for all new and existing third parties that require access to data  held by SCA or that host or manage data on SCA’s behalf. Corporate activity that  does not represent fair  value to shareholders Investment markets undervalue the Group’s business, especially as the Group transitions from its legacy  broadcast operations to high growth digital audio operations. This risk is exacerbated by the concentration of  ownership of the Group by shareholders with conflicting interests. The Group expects its completed investment in digital transformation and its ongoing cost-out program  to deliver improved returns in FY25 and beyond. In addition, during FY25, the Group will launch a  programme to improve the understanding of the Group’s assets, operations and strategy among current and  potential investors. 1	 The Infinite Dial Australia 2024 study. 2	 CRA Australian Podcast Ranker – Top Sales Representatives – June 2024. 2024 Annual Report Directors’ Report | 31   ===== PAGE 34 ===== Distributions and Dividends  Type Cents per  share Total  Amount  $’m Date of  Payment Final 2023 Ordinary 2.2 cents $5.3 million 4 October 2023 Interim 2024 Ordinary 1.0 cent $2.4 million 12 April 2024 There will be no final dividend paid for the year  ended 30 June 2024. Significant Changes in State of Affairs In the opinion of the Directors, there were no significant changes  in the state of affairs of the Group that occurred during the  year under review. Events Occurring After Balance Date Events occurring after balance date are outlined in note 25  ‘Events Occurring After Balance Date’ to the Financial Statements. Likely Developments and Expected Results of Operations Further information on likely developments relating to the  operations of the Group in future years and the expected results  of those operations has not been included in this report because  the Directors of the Company believe it would be likely to result in  unreasonable prejudice to the commercial interests of the Group.  Indemnification and Insurance of Officers and Auditors During the year the Company paid a premium of $1,194,523 to  insure its officers. So long as the officers of the Company act in  accordance with the Constitution and the law, the officers remain  indemnified out of the assets of the Company and the Group  against any losses incurred while acting on behalf of the Company  and the Group. The auditors of the Group are in no way indemnified  out of the assets of the Group. Non-Audit Services The Company may decide to employ the auditor on assignments  additional to its statutory audit duties where the auditor’s expertise  and experience with the Group are important. Details of the amounts paid or payable to the auditor  (PricewaterhouseCoopers Australia) for audit and non-audit  services provided during the year are set out in note 22. The Board has considered the position and, in accordance with  advice received from the Audit & Risk Committee, is satisfied that  the provision of the non-audit services is compatible with the  general standard of independence for auditors imposed by the  Corporations Act 2001. The Directors are satisfied that the provision  of non-audit services by the auditor did not compromise the auditor  independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 for the  following reasons: –	 all non-audit services have been reviewed by the Audit & Risk  Committee to ensure they do not impact the impartiality and  objectivity of the auditor; and –	 none of the services undermine the general principles relating  to auditor independence as set out in APES 110 Code of Ethics  for Professional Accountants. Environmental Regulation The operations of the Group are not subject to any significant  environmental regulations under Australian Commonwealth, State  or Territory law. The Directors are not aware of any breaches of any  environmental regulations.

Southern Cross Austereo 34 | Directors’ Report Directors’ Report For the year ended 30 June 2024  ===== PAGE 37 =====  Remuneration Report Letter from People & Culture Committee Overview On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present SCA’s remuneration  report for the year ended 30 June 2024 (FY24). The People  & Culture Committee (PCC) assists the Board in its oversight  of management activities in developing and implementing  strategies to improve SCA’s financial performance, culture, and  diversity, consistent with our values. The PCC also oversees the  composition, performance and remuneration of SCA’s executive  key management personnel (KMP) and the other members of SCA’s  Senior Leadership Team (leadership executives). An important  part of the PCC’s role is to ensure SCA’s remuneration policies  align executive reward with creation of value for shareholders,  having regard to applicable governance, legal and regulatory  requirements, and industry standards. SCA’s executive remuneration includes fixed and variable  components. SCA operates a combined Executive Incentive Plan  (EIP), which provides a simple and direct way to link executive  performance and reward to generation of sustainable positive  returns for shareholders. Executive Incentive Plan Under the EIP, the performance of the executive KMP and other  executives is assessed annually against a mix of financial and  non-financial performance measures. The EIP uses a balanced  scorecard to assess an executive’s performance. Sixty percent  of the annual award for SCA’s Senior Leadership Team is based  on performance against annual financial performance hurdles.  Non-financial measures – accounting for 40% of the annual award  – include execution of strategic projects designed to drive future  financial performance, and cultural and behavioural influences.  This balanced scorecard recognises the long-term benefits to the  organisation of SCA’s leaders committing to develop and maintain  a strong culture and operational discipline. In all cases, executives’  maximum EIP opportunity is capped at target. The Board also maintains a corporate balanced scorecard to assess  overall performance against agreed targets for radio audience  survey performance, advertising market commercial share, growth  in Digital Audio reach and monthly active users of LiSTNR, as  well as financial performance measures. Several of the measures  from the corporate scorecard are reflected in the scorecards of  individual executives, and the Board also uses the scorecard to  inform its exercise of discretion when considering the performance  and incentive opportunities of individual executives. The annual EIP award to each executive KMP is settled partly in  cash and the remainder in equity performance rights. The cash  component is 40% for the CEO and 50% for other executive KMP.  These performance rights are eligible for vesting and conversion  to ordinary shares at the end of year 3, subject to ongoing  employment. Vesting of one-half of an executive’s performance  rights will potentially be scaled back according to whether SCA  achieves satisfactory growth in earnings per share over this  three-year period. A further restriction on disposal of vested  shares applies until the end of year 5, two years after allocation of  any vested shares. Executive remuneration in FY24 FY24 was the first full year of service for each of SCA’s three  executive KMP in their current roles. The Board set their respective  remuneration with the assistance of external search consultants  and independent benchmarking advice from KPMG. With the  Board’s endorsement, KPMG selected a comparator group  comprising 34 companies in the Consumer Staples, Consumer  Discretionary, Communication Services and Information Technology  sectors with an average market capitalisation of between  $200 million and $420 million along with certain other companies  with similar market capitalisation. The Board approved total  remuneration for these roles between the 60th and 80th percentile  of the comparator group. Under the FY24 EIP, the performance of each executive KMP was  assessed against a mix of financial and non-financial performance  measures. The profitability and financial performance measures  under the FY24 EIP were group EBITDA, advertising revenue, and  non-revenue related costs compared to budget. The EBITDA and  advertising revenue targets were not achieved. The non-financial goals of leadership executives targeted growth in  SCA’s Broadcast Radio and Digital Audio audiences, expansion of  digital revenues, optimising the Group’s operating model, deploying  a commercially effective diversity and inclusion strategy, and  improving the understanding among media buyers and investors of  SCA’s digital transformation strategy. The Board acknowledged external economic factors leading to  a contraction in broadcast advertising markets had contributed  to the significant shortfalls against revenue and earnings targets.  The management team was also diverted during the year by  corporate activity, most notably the unsolicited non-binding  indicative offer received from ARN Media and Anchorage Capital  Partners. The uncertainty caused by this proposal and the  resources required to deal with it meant that some optimisation  initiatives were deferred. Against this background, the Board  acknowledged management’s efforts and achievements during the  year to grow broadcast audiences, improve metro radio commercial  shares, bring LiSTNR to EBITDA profitability, and control cost  growth in an inflationary environment. The Board assessed that executive KMP and other leadership  executives achieved a portion of their EIP opportunities based on  the measures in their respective balanced scorecards. However,  considering that SCA’s corporate revenue and earnings outcomes  fell short of targets and the ongoing deterioration in SCA’s share  price during the year, the Board, in consultation with management,  decided that no cash or performance rights should be awarded  under the FY24 EIP. In making this decision, the Board is conscious that the award of  performance rights under the EIP is designed to provide ongoing  performance and retention incentives for executives in subsequent  years. Any performance rights granted under the FY24 EIP would  have been eligible for vesting after 30 June 2026 and there will  now be a gap in potential reward for executives and alignment with  shareholders’ interests at that time if SCA’s financial performance  improves in coming years. Summary details of the EIP assessment and outcome for  each executive KMP are provided in section 4.1.2 of the  remuneration report. 2024 Annual Report Directors’ Report | 35   ===== PAGE 38 ===== Letter from People & Culture Committee (continued) FY22 EIP Fifty percent of the first performance rights granted under  SCA’s EIP in FY22 will vest in September 2024. SCA will acquire  shares on-market and allocate those shares to participating  executives. Vesting of the remaining 50% was contingent on SCA  achieving a cumulative annual growth rate in earnings per share  of at least 1.5% over the three years ended on 30 June 2024.  That threshold was not met. The shares allocated to executives on partial vesting of their FY22  EIP performance rights will be subject to disposal restrictions until  30 June 2026 or earlier cessation of employment, aligning the  interests of these executives with those of our shareholders. Board remuneration The Board reviewed its fees for non-executive directors during  the year. For that purpose, the Board engaged KPMG to prepare  a report benchmarking the Board’s size, committee structure and  remuneration. With the Board’s approval, KPMG selected two  comparator groups for benchmarking purposes: the bespoke group  mentioned above used to benchmark the remuneration of the  CEO and Chief Commercial Officer, and the companies in the ASX  250-300 by market capitalisation (excluding materials). While SCA’s  current market capitalisation is lower than that of the companies  in these comparator groups, the Board considers SCA’s scale,  complexity and risk supports comparison with them. SCA’s total  assets, total revenue and number of employees are in the top half  of both comparator groups. The Board also considered recent changes in its size and  composition. The Board had seven non-executive directors in FY23  and six for most of FY24. Following the retirement of two Directors  in March 2024, the Board now has only four non-executive directors  and intends to maintain this size in FY25. After considering these matters, the Board has resolved to  reduce its fees for FY25. Details are provided in section 2.7 of the  remuneration report. The PCC continues to strive to ensure SCA’s remuneration  framework will drive behaviours to generate sustainable value for  shareholders. I look forward to your feedback and to welcoming  you to our 2024 Annual General Meeting. Yours faithfully, Heith Mackay-Cruise Chair of the People & Culture Committee Southern Cross Austereo 36 | Directors’ Report Directors’ Report For the year ended 30 June 2024  ===== PAGE 39 ===== 1.

The aggregate remuneration of SCA’s non-executive directors is expected to be about $760,000 in FY25. Changes are due principally to reduction since FY22 in the number of non-executive directors from seven to four and changes in the  compositions of the Board’s Committees.

Executive reward is aligned with the  achievement of strategic objectives and the creation of value for shareholders and is informed by market practice for executive reward. Executive remuneration packages include a mix of fixed and variable remuneration. More senior roles in the organisation have a greater  weighting towards variable remuneration.

The EIP is a combined incentive plan under which awards are paid partly in cash and partly in equity performance rights that are eligible for vesting at the end  of year 3. The percentages in this column are the equity performance rights component of an executive’s EIP opportunity in FY24. 3	 John Kelly was Chief Operating Officer in FY23 and was appointed as Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director with effect from 1 July 2023. 2.2	 Fixed remuneration for executive KMP Fixed remuneration for executives is structured as a total employment package. Executives receive a combination of fixed base pay, at-risk  incentive opportunities, and prescribed non-financial benefits at the executive’s discretion. SCA contributes superannuation on behalf of  executives in accordance with the superannuation guarantee legislation. Fixed remuneration is reviewed annually to ensure the executive’s pay is competitive and appropriate for the results delivered. There are no  guaranteed fixed remuneration increases included in any executive KMP contracts. FY24 was the first full year of service in their current role for each of SCA’s three executive KMP. The Board set their respective  remuneration with the assistance of external search consultants and independent benchmarking advice from KPMG. With the Board’s  endorsement, KPMG selected a comparator group comprising 34 companies in the Consumer Staples, Consumer Discretionary,  Communication Services and Information Technology sectors with an average market capitalisation of between $200 million and  $420 million along with certain other companies with similar market capitalisation. The Board approved total remuneration for these roles  between the 60th and 80th percentile of the comparator group. 2.3	 Variable remuneration for executive KMP The table below outlines details of the Company’s executive incentive plan (EIP) in FY24. The EIP operated for the first time in FY22. What is the incentive? The EIP is an annual at-risk bonus designed to reward executives for meeting or exceeding financial and  non-financial objectives. How is each executive’s  entitlement determined? Each executive is allocated a dollar value target (which may be a fixed percentage of the executive’s total  remuneration) representing the executive’s maximum EIP opportunity for the one-year performance period. How is the  incentive delivered? The EIP operates over five years as follows: –	 a one-year performance period commencing on 1 July in the first year of the EIP, after which individual and  corporate performance is assessed and an EIP award may be made partly in cash and partly in grant of  performance rights; –	 a two-year service period commencing on 1 July in the second year of the EIP, after which performance  rights will be eligible for vesting and conversion to fully paid ordinary shares; and –	 a two-year retention period commencing on 1 July in the fourth year of the EIP, during which any shares  allocated at the end of the service period are subject to a disposal restriction. To the extent the EIP performance conditions for an executive are satisfied during the performance period,  SCA will make an EIP award to the executive. SCA will satisfy the dollar value of the EIP award by: –	 paying the executive the cash component of the EIP award; and –	 granting the executive performance rights with a face value equal to the equity component of the EIP award  in two equal tranches. The number of performance rights granted to the executive is calculated by dividing the dollar value of the  equity component of the EIP award by the face value of a performance right. The face value of a performance  right is: –	 the volume weighted average price of SCA’s shares for the five trading days commencing seven days after  SCA’s results for the performance period are announced to the ASX; less –	 the amount of any final dividend per share declared as payable in respect of the performance period. These performance rights will be eligible for vesting after the end of year 3, two years after their grant to the  executive. This two-year period is referred to as the service period. Southern Cross Austereo 38 | Directors’ Report Directors’ Report For the year ended 30 June 2024  ===== PAGE 41 ===== What are the  performance measures  and hurdles? The Board sets the annual goals for the CEO near the beginning of each financial year. The goals are allocated  to three categories having regard to SCA’s business strategy: financial performance (60%), strategic execution  (30%) and culture and behaviour (10%). In consultation with the Board, the CEO determines the annual goals for other leadership executives in the  same three categories and having regard to their areas of responsibility. Financial performance (60%) The financial performance metrics that applied under the EIP for all executive KMP in FY24 are  summarised below. –	 Group EBITDA compared to budget: This is a core measure of operational profitability and, as such, is  measured excluding significant items. This EBITDA measure is the one used throughout the Remuneration  Report unless otherwise noted. –	 Revenue compared to budget: Targets may be set for total revenue or for specific categories of revenue,  such as Digital Audio revenue. –	 Non-Revenue Related costs compared to budget: These controllable costs exclude costs such as agency  commissions and television affiliation fees that are variable with revenue. Achievements against financial metrics are based on SCA’s audited annual financial report.  The Board has  discretion to adjust targets and outcomes to ensure executive reward is appropriately linked to corporate  performance. For this purpose, the Board may consider matters including SCA’s overall corporate performance  and progress against strategic objectives; significant non-cash items (such as impairment losses); acquisitions,  divestments, one-off events; and abnormal or non-recurring items. The results of investments are typically  excluded from executive incentive measurements. Strategic execution (30%) Goals for strategic execution are tailored to the individual responsibilities of each executive. These goals focus  on implementation of strategic initiatives, major projects, and material operational improvements designed  to deliver growth, improved and sustainable business performance, and shareholder value. These goals may  include financially based targets for strategic or growth-oriented parts of the business for which SCA has  long-term aspirations. Culture and behaviour (10%) Goals for culture and behaviour are tailored to the individual responsibilities of each executive. These goals  focus on maintaining a positive corporate culture, effective leadership, and development, retaining talent,  and building effective external relationships to improve and sustain long-term business performance and  shareholder value. Is there a gateway? The following minimum performance and vesting schedules apply for EIP awards based on financial metrics: EBITDA – percentage of budget Vesting percentage Below 95% Nil 95% 50% Above 95% to 102.5% Straight-line vesting between 50% and 100% Above 102.5% 100% Revenue – percentage of budget Vesting percentage Below 97% Nil 97% 50% Above 97% to 100% Straight-line vesting between 50% and 100% Above 100% 100% Non-revenue related costs – percentage of budget Vesting percentage Above budget Nil On budget or below 100% None of the above financial measures operates as a gateway to an award being made under any other financial  or non-financial measure. Individual performance must be at a ‘meets expectations’ level before any EIP award will be made. What is the maximum  amount payable? The maximum award under the FY24 EIP is 100% of an executive’s EIP target opportunity if all vesting conditions  are fully satisfied over the one-year performance period. 2024 Annual Report Directors’ Report | 39   ===== PAGE 42 ===== How is performance   assessed? The Board will calculate the financial measures under the EIP at the end of the performance period. SCA may  engage an independent consultant to review or carry out these calculations. The Board has discretion to adjust  targets and outcomes to ensure executive reward is appropriately linked to corporate performance. CEO: At the end of the financial year, with the assistance of the Board’s People & Culture Committee, the  Board assesses the performance of the CEO against the applicable non-financial measures and determines  the extent to which the CEO has achieved applicable targets. In doing so, the Board may consider the CEO’s  achievements in the context of SCA’s overall performance. Other executive KMP and leadership executives: At the end of the financial year, the CEO assesses the  performance of the other leadership executives against the applicable non-financial measures and determines  the extent to which each leadership executive has achieved applicable targets. In doing so, the CEO may  consider each leadership executive’s achievements in the context of SCA’s overall performance. The CEO  provides these assessments to the People & Culture Committee for review. Vesting of performance  rights after service   period If the executive remains employed by SCA at the end of the two-year service period: –	 Tranche 1 of the executive’s EIP award will vest at that time; and –	 Tranche 2 of the executive’s EIP award will be eligible for vesting according to the following scale of SCA’s  EPS growth during the first three years of each EIP cycle (comprising the one-year performance period and  the two-year service period).  3-year EPS CAGR % of Tranche 2 that vests 1.5% or below Nil Above 1.5% – 8.0% Straight-line vesting between 0% and 100% Above 8.0% 100% SCA will allocate one fully paid ordinary share for each of the executive’s performance rights that vests at the  end of the two-year service period. An executive will receive an additional allocation of fully paid ordinary  shares with a value equal to the dividends paid on vested rights in respect of the two-year service period.  The Board has discretion to settle vested awards in cash. Any performance rights that do not vest at the end of the service period will lapse. The Board has discretion to fulfil SCA’s obligation to allocate shares on vesting by issuing new shares or  acquiring shares on-market. Shares allocated under the EIP are subject to disposal restrictions for two years (until 1 July after the end of  year 5) or cessation of the executive’s employment, whichever is earlier. For leadership executives, these  shares will be subject to further disposal restrictions under the Senior Executive Share Ownership Policy unless  the leadership executive has accumulated the target shareholding required under that policy. Cessation of   employment If an executive ceases employment with SCA during the five-year term of an EIP cycle, the treatment of  executive’s rights under the EIP will be determined by the time and circumstances of the cessation of  employment as explained below. During performance period Bad Leavers (who resign or are terminated for cause) during the year 1 performance period will not be eligible  for an award under the EIP. For an executive who ceases employment for other reasons during the performance period, the Board has  discretion to make an award to the executive under the EIP on a pro-rata basis considering time and the  performance to date against the applicable performance measures, to hold the EIP award to be tested against  the applicable performance measures at the end of the original performance period , or to treat the EIP award in  any other manner it considers appropriate. During service period Bad Leavers (who resign or are terminated for cause) during the two-year service period will forfeit any  unvested performance rights,  unless otherwise determined by the Board. For executives who cease employment during the service period for other reasons, the Board has discretion to  vest any unvested performance rights on a pro-rata basis considering time and the performance to date against  the EPS performance hurdle, to hold all or a part of any unvested performance rights to be tested against the  EPS performance hurdle at the end of the original service period, or to treat the award in any other manner it  deems appropriate. After service period If an executive ceases employment with SCA after the service period, SCA will release the executive’s shares  from any remaining restrictions on disposal. Southern Cross Austereo 40 | Directors’ Report Directors’ Report For the year ended 30 June 2024  ===== PAGE 43 ===== Change of control If a change of control event in relation to SCA occurs before assessment of performance under an EIP award or  before vesting of performance rights granted under an EIP award, the Board has discretion as to how to treat  the unassessed award or unvested performance rights, including to forfeit or make an award in whole or in part,  to determine performance rights will vest or lapse in whole or in part, or that performance rights will continue  subject to the same or different conditions. In exercising its discretion, the Board may consider the proportion  of the performance period and the service period that has passed at the time of the change of control, the  performance to date of SCA and the executive against applicable performance conditions , and any other  matters the Board considers to be relevant. Clawback The Board may reconsider the level of satisfaction of a performance hurdle and take steps to reduce the benefit  of an EIP award to the extent its vesting was affected by fraud, dishonesty, breach of obligation or other action  likely to result in long-term detriment to SCA. Other features Treatment of dividends: There are no dividends payable to executives on unvested performance rights.  Once performance rights have vested to fully paid ordinary shares, the executive will be entitled to dividends  on these shares. In addition, upon vesting of an executive’s performance rights, the executive will receive an  additional allocation of fully paid ordinary shares with a value equal to the dividends paid on vested rights in  respect of the two-year service period. Sourcing of shares: The Board has discretion to purchase shares on-market or to issue new shares in respect  of vested performance rights. The Board typically chooses to purchase shares on-market for this purpose. Retention of shares: Participants must retain any shares allocated to them upon vesting of performance rights  for two years or until cessation of employment, whichever is earlier. SCA’s Senior Executive Share Ownership  Policy also applies to shares allocated to leadership executives on vesting of performance rights under the EIP. 2.4	 Consequences of performance on shareholder value In considering the Group’s performance and the benefits for shareholder value, the Board has regard to the following indicators in the  current financial year and the preceding four financial years.  30 June 2024 $’000 30 June 2023 $’000 30 June 2022 $’000 30 June 2021 $’000 30 June 2020 $’000 Revenue 499,405 504,294 519,682 528,649 540,152 EBITDA1 66,209 77,169 89,646 125,936 111,133 EBITDA % 13.3% 15.3% 17.3% 23.8% 20.0% Net (loss)/profit before tax (320,578) 27,253 (214,068) 71,282 38,294 Net (loss)/profit after tax (NPAT) (224,604) 19,109 (153,722) 48,096 25,100 NPAT % (45.0)% 3.8% (29.6%) 9.1% 4.6% Net profit after tax excluding significant items 11,152 21,882 28,554 48,096 34,193 NPAT % excluding significant items 2.2% 4.3% 5.5% 9.1% 6.3% EPS (cents)1 4.65 8.85 10.82 24.1 17.69 Opening share price2,4 $0.865 $0.99 $2.093 $1.75 $8.60 Closing share price2,4 $0.61 $0.865 $0.99 $2.093 $1.75 Dividend/Distribution5 1.0c 9.35c 9.50c 0.00c 4.00c 1	 EBITDA and EPS are shown after adjustments to exclude the impact of significant or non-recurring items as approved by the Board for the  purposes of SCA’s EIP. 2 	 On 4 May 2020, the Company completed a $169.6 million equity raising. The equity raising consisted of a pro-rata accelerated non-renounceable rights issue  and placement, resulting in the issue of 1,873,092,080 shares. 3	 On 30 October 2020, the Company’s shareholders approved a one for 10 consolidation of the Company’s share capital. The consolidation was implemented  on 2 November 2020. As a result, the number of shares on issue reduced from 2,642,105,685 to 264,214,027. 4	 Opening and closing share prices and dividends per share have been adjusted for the rights issue component of the equity raising referred to in note 2 and the  consolidation of share capital referred to in note 3 (Source: Capital IQ) 5	 Dividends paid during FY20 represent amounts paid per share prior to the equity raising and prior to the share consolidation. 2024 Annual Report Directors’ Report | 41   ===== PAGE 44 ===== 2.5	 Executive service contracts SCA has entered service contracts setting out the terms of employment of each executive KMP. All service contracts are for an indefinite  term, subject to termination by either party on up to six months’ notice. Each executive service contract provides for the payment of base  salary and participation in SCA’s incentive plans, along with other prescribed non-monetary benefits. 2.6	 Services from remuneration consultants The Board engaged KPMG during the year to prepare a report benchmarking the Board’s size, committee structure and remuneration. The  Board also engaged KPMG to advise on executive remuneration strategies relating to the additional work required of certain executives to  respond to the non-binding indicative offer received from the consortium comprising ARN Media and Anchorage Capital Partners, and the  change of control that would have occurred had that offer proceeded. KPMG did not make any remuneration recommendations (as defined  in the Corporations Act). KPMG was paid a total of $81,873 for these services. Deloitte was engaged during the year to advise on valuation of outstanding entitlements granted under SCA’s EIP. Deloitte did not make  any remuneration recommendations (as defined in the Corporations Act). Deloitte was paid $1,500 for these services. 2.7	 Remuneration of non-executive directors SCA enters a letter of appointment with each non-executive director. The letter sets out the Board’s expectations for non-executive  directors and the remuneration payable to non-executive directors. The maximum annual aggregate fee pool for non-executive directors is $1,500,000. This was confirmed in amendments to the Constitution  approved by shareholders at the 2020 AGM. The Chair receives a fixed aggregate fee. Other non-executive directors receive a base fee for acting as a Director and additional fees for  acting as chair or as a member of the Board’s committees. Non-executive directors do not receive performance-based fees and are not  entitled to retirement benefits. The table below sets out the scale of fees for non-executive directors that applied in FY23 and FY24 and those that will apply in FY25. The  Board has decided to reduce its fees in FY25. This followed the Board’s consideration of an independent benchmarking report from KPMG. ﻿ FY23 $ FY24 $ FY25 $ Base fees – Annual Chair1 273,000 273,000 270,000 Other non-executive directors 136,500 136,500 135,000 Committee fees – Annual Audit & Risk Committee – Chair 23,000 23,000 20,000 Audit & Risk Committee – member 15,500 15,500 10,000 People & Culture Committee – Chair1 23,000 23,000 20,000 People & Culture Committee – member 15,500 15,500 10,000 Digital Transformation Committee2 – Chair 23,000 23,000 – Digital Transformation Committee – member 15,500 15,500 – Nomination Committee2 – Chair 16,500 – – Nomination Committee – member 11,000 – – 1 	 The Chair does not receive additional fees for committee work. While Heith Mackay-Cruise serves as Chair of the People & Culture Committee, he will not  receive an additional fee for acting as Chair of that Committee. 2	 The Board disbanded the Nomination Committee in June 2023 and the Digital Transformation Committee in December 2023 and has resumed responsibility  for the matters formerly delegated to those Committees. Members of the Nomination Committee waived their fees in FY23 because the Nomination Committee  did not meet during that year.

Tranche 1 (50%) of these performance rights granted in September 2022 will vest based on continuity of employment.

Accordingly, Tranche 2 of the performance rights awarded under the FY22 EIP will not vest. Vesting of Tranche 1 of the performance rights awarded under the FY22 EIP (including rights awarded for dividends paid or payable in  respect of FY23 and FY24) will be reported in FY25.

Summary of Material Accounting Policies The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of  these consolidated financial statements are set out below. In  addition, significant and other accounting policies that summarise  the measurement basis used and that are relevant to an  understanding of the financial statements are provided throughout  the notes to the consolidated financial statements. These policies  have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless  otherwise stated. The financial statements are for the consolidated  entity consisting of Southern Cross Media Group Limited (‘the  Company’) and its subsidiaries (‘the Group’).  Basis of preparation  This general purpose financial report has been prepared in  accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the  Corporations Act 2001 (where applicable). The Group is a for-profit  entity for the purpose of preparing the financial statements.  These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern  basis. The Group has performed an assessment of its ability to  continue as a going concern. The assessment has considered  the balance sheet position, including $10.5 million of cash and  cash equivalents at 30 June 2024; forecast performance; and  the expectations that the Group will comply with its debt facility  covenants. Based on the assessment, the Group concluded  that these financial statements should be prepared on a  going concern basis. Information in respect of the parent entity in this financial report  relates to Southern Cross Media Group Limited. i) Compliance with IFRS Compliance with Australian Accounting Standards ensures that  the financial statements and notes of the Group comply with  International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as issued by the  International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’). Consequently,  this financial report has also been prepared in accordance with and  complies with IFRS as issued by the IASB. ii) Historical cost convention These financial statements have been prepared under the historical  cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial  assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value  through profit or loss. All amounts are presented in Australian  dollars, unless otherwise noted. iii) Comparative figures  Where necessary, comparative figures have been adjusted to  conform to changes in presentation in the current year. Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and  liabilities of all subsidiaries of the Company as at 30 June 2024 and  the results of all subsidiaries for the year then ended. Subsidiaries  are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls  an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable  returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to  affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the  entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which  control is transferred to the Group. The effects of all transactions  between entities in the Group are eliminated in full. Rounding of amounts The Company is of a kind referred to in ASIC Legislative Instrument  2016/191, relating to the ‘rounding off’ of amounts in the Directors’  Report and Financial Report. Amounts have been rounded off in  accordance with the Instrument to the nearest thousand dollars,  unless otherwise indicated. Critical accounting estimates and judgement The preparation of the financial report in accordance with Australian  Accounting Standards requires the use of certain critical accounting  estimates. It also requires management to exercise judgement in  the process of applying the accounting policies. Estimates and  judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical  experience and other factors, including expectations of future  events that may have a financial impact on the entity and that are  believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management  believes the estimates used in the preparation of the financial report  are reasonable. Actual results in the future may differ from those  reported. Judgements and estimates which are material to the  financial report are found in the following notes: Note 8	 Non-Current Assets – Intangible Assets  Note 9 	 Impairment Note 11	 Receivables, Payables, Deferred Income and Provisions Note 24	 Leases and Other Commitments  Market conditions The slow macroeconomic environment in Australia, with continued  high interest rates, has contributed to challenging conditions in the  traditional advertising markets in which the Group operates. As a consequence, management has: –	 Continued to evaluate areas of judgement or  estimation uncertainty; –	 Updated its economic outlook, principally for the purposes of  input into the impairment analysis of financial and non-financial  assets classes, but also for input into its expected credit losses  through the application of forward-looking information and  disclosures such as fair value disclosures of financial assets and  liabilities; and –	 Reviewed public and industry forecasts for input into  the impairment assessment of the Broadcast Radio and  Digital Audio CGUs. Further judgements and estimates were required due to these  external factors and are detailed further in the notes to the  consolidated financial statements, in particular: Note 9	 Impairment Note 11	 Receivables, Payables, Deferred Income and Provisions Note 12	 Capital Management Objectives Note 17	 Financial Risk Management Note 18	 Non-Current Assets – Investments Notes to the consolidated financial statements Notes relating to individual line items in the consolidated financial  statements now include accounting policy information where it is  considered relevant to an understanding of these items, as well as  information about critical accounting estimates and judgements.  Details of the impact of new accounting policies and all other  accounting policy information are disclosed at the end of the  financial report in note 26. 2024 Annual Report Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements | 57   ===== PAGE 60 ===== 2.	 Segment Information AASB 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly  reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in order to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance. The Group has determined operating segments are based on the information reported to the Group CEO and the Company Board  of Directors, the Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’). Towards the end of the second half of the reporting period, the financial  performance of Digital Audio to the CODM significantly increased in prominence and is now considered a separate operating segment from  Broadcast Radio. Consequently, the Group has determined that it has three main operating segments being: –	 Broadcast Radio, comprising metro and regional radio, and other related businesses; –	 Digital Audio; and –	  Television, comprising the regional television business ﻿ Broadcast Radio Digital Audio Television Corporate Consolidated 2024 $’000 20234 $’000 2024 $’000 20234 $’000  2024 $’000 2023 $’000 2024 $’000 2023 $’000 2024 $’000 2023 $’000 Segment revenue 366,620 372,570 35,031 24,626 97,489 106,742 265 356 499,405 504,294 National revenue1 202,963 211,401 – – 54,782 61,932 – – 257,745 273,333 Local revenue2 141,285 136,923 – – 34,369 37,824 – – 175,654 174,747 Other 22,372 24,246 35,031 24,626 8,338 6,986 265 356 66,006 56,214 Total revenue 366,620 372,570 35,031 24,626 97,489 106,742 265 356 499,405 504,294 EBITDA before  significant items3 87,181 97,860 (10,909) (17,584) 13,278 18,684 (23,341) (21,791) 66,209 77,169 Reported EBITDA 84,437 95,830 (13,595) (17,584) 12,985 18,668 (28,287) (23,706) 55,540 73,208 EBITDA % of Revenue 23.0% 25.7% (38.8)% (71.4)% 13.3% 17.5% N/A N/A 11.1% 14.5% Impairment of broadcast  radio licences (326,126) – – – – – – – (326,126) – Depreciation  and amortisation – – – – – – – – (31,087) (29,155) Statutory EBIT/  Segment Result – – – – – – – – (301,673) 44,053 Financing costs – – – – – – – – (18,905) (16,800) Income tax   (expense)/credit – – – – – – – – 95,974 (8,144) Profit/(Loss) for the  year attributable  to shareholders – – – – – – – – (224,604) 19,109 1	 National revenue is sold by SCA’s national sales team who are able to sell all SCA products across all markets. 2	 Local revenue is sold directly by SCA’s local sales team who are only able to sell local products specific to the particular market. 3 	 Refer to Note 4 ‘Significant Items’. 4	 To allow consistency comparisons, the prior year comparatives have been restated to reflect the change in reportable operating segments. 5	 The CODM reviews the balance sheet on a consolidated basis only. Southern Cross Austereo 58 | Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2024  ===== PAGE 61 ===== 3.	 Revenue The profit before income tax from continuing operations included the following specific items of revenue: ﻿ Consolidated 2024 $’000 2023 $’000 Revenue from continuing operations Sales revenue 499,115 503,951 Rental revenue 290 343 Total revenue from continuing operations 499,405 504,294 Recognition and Measurement Revenues are recognised at fair value of the consideration received or receivable net of the amount of GST payable to the relevant  taxation authority. Sales revenue Under AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of the goods or  services. Determining the timing of the transfer of control requires judgement. The Group recognises revenue at the point the underlying  performance obligation has been completed and control of the services or goods passes to the customer. Revenue represents revenue earned primarily from the sale of radio, digital and television advertising airtime and related activities,  including sponsorship and promotions. Based on the Group being considered the principal entity in the sale of radio, digital and advertising, revenue is recognised gross of  rebates and agency commissions. For significant payment terms refer to note 11. Advertising revenue is recognised at a point in time when the underlying performance obligation has been satisfied, being primarily when  the advertisement is aired. Sponsorship revenue is included within advertising revenue and the length of the sponsorship can vary in length of time. Revenue is  recognised over the period to which the sponsorship relates. Production services used to create advertising suitable for broadcast is treated as a separate performance obligation. Production  revenue is recognised at a point in time when the Group has completed the production service, which is likely to be before the relevant  advertising is broadcast. Included within advertising revenue is the Australian Traffic Network (ATN) contract where revenue is recognised over time. The ATN  contract has been deemed to contain a significant financing component. Revenue from this contract has been recalculated over the  30-year contract period and has been grossed up to account for interest expense (for further detail refer to note 11). Digital revenue is recognised at the point the underlying performance obligations of the contract have been delivered to the customer.  SCA determines whether it is the principal or agent under AASB 15. SCA is the principal in a transaction when it has primary responsibility  for fulfilling the promise, the inventory risk and discretion in establishing price. Revenue is recognised as gross when SCA is principal,  with a corresponding expense for any fees which could include agency commission. SCA is the agent in a transaction when it receives a  commission/revenue share, has no inventory risk and little or no discretion in establishing price. Revenue is recognised as net when SCA is  an agent, with no corresponding expense for any fees.

There are $58.155 million available of unused tax losses on the capital account for which no deferred tax asset has been  recognised (2023: $58.966 million). There are no other unused tax losses for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised. Recognition and Measurement Income Tax Income tax amounts recognised in the Group’s financial statements relate to tax paying entities within the Group and have been recognised  in accordance with Group policy. The income tax expense for the year is the tax payable on the current year’s taxable income based on the applicable tax rate for each  jurisdiction adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets  and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements and adjusted by changes to unused tax losses. Deferred Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences at the tax rates expected to apply when the assets are  recovered or liabilities are settled, based on those tax rates which are enacted or substantively enacted for each jurisdiction. The  relevant tax rates are applied to the cumulative amounts of deductible and taxable temporary differences to measure the deferred tax  asset or liability. Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable  amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses. In determining the extent of temporary differences of assets, the carrying amount of assets is assumed to be recovered through use.

Cost includes those  costs directly attributable to bringing the assets into the location and working condition necessary for the asset to be capable of operating  in the manner intended by management. The estimated cost of dismantling and removing infrastructure items and restoring the site on  which the assets are located is only included in the cost of the asset to the extent that the Group has an obligation to restore the site and  the cost of restoration is not recoverable from third parties. Additions, renewals and improvements are capitalised, while maintenance and  repairs are expensed. The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate  that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the  asset’s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount. Depreciation Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is calculated on a straight-line basis to amortise the cost of the asset over its  estimated useful life. Estimates of remaining useful life are made on a regular basis for all assets, with annual reassessments for major items. The expected useful  life of property, plant and equipment is as follows:  Buildings 25 – 50 years Leasehold improvements 3 – 16 years Network equipment 2 – 10 years Communication equipment 3 – 5 years Other plant and equipment 2 – 20 years Leased plant and equipment 2 – 20 years Southern Cross Austereo 62 | Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2024  ===== PAGE 65 ===== 8.

The tests incorporate assumptions regarding future events which may or may not occur, resulting  in the need for future revisions of estimates. There are also judgements involved in determination of cash generating units (‘CGUs’). Key Judgement Useful Life A summary of the useful lives of intangible assets is as follows: Commercial Television/Radio Broadcasting Licences	 Indefinite Brands and Tradenames	 Indefinite Licences Television and radio licences are initially recognised at cost. Analogue licences are renewable for a minimal cost every five years under  provisions within the Broadcasting Services Act. Digital licences attach to the analogue licences and renew automatically. The Directors  understand that the revocation of a commercial television or radio licence has never occurred in Australia and have no reason to believe  the licences have a finite life. During the year, the free-to-air commercial television and radio broadcasting licences have been assessed  to have indefinite useful lives. Brands Brands are initially recognised at cost. The brands have been assessed to have indefinite useful lives. The Group’s brands operate in  established markets with limited restrictions and are expected to continue to complement the Group’s media initiatives. On this basis,  the Directors have determined that brands have indefinite lives as there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the assets are  expected to generate net cash inflows. 2024 Annual Report Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements | 63   ===== PAGE 66 ===== 8.	 Non-Current Assets – Intangible Assets (continued) Other intangible assets IT development and software Costs associated with maintaining software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the  Group are recognised as intangible assets where the following criteria are met: –	 it is technically feasible to complete the software so that it will be available for use –	 management intends to complete the software and use or sell it –	 there is an ability to use or sell the software –	 it can be demonstrated how the software will generate probable future economic benefits and adequate technical, financial and other  resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software is available, and –	 the expenditure attributable to the software during its development can be reliably measured. Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software include employee and contractor costs. Capitalised development costs are recorded as intangible assets and amortised from the point at which the asset is ready for use. The Group amortises other intangible assets with a limited useful life using the straight-line method over the following periods: IT development and software 3 – 5 years Customer contracts 5 years 9.	 Impairment a) Impairment tests for licences, tradenames, brands and goodwill  The value of licences, tradenames, brands and goodwill is allocated to the Group’s cash generating units (‘CGUs’). Towards the end of the  second half of the reporting period, it was determined that Broadcast Radio and Digital Audio, formerly comprising the Audio CGU, had  independent cash inflows for the first time and at 30 June 2024 the CGUs have been identified as being Broadcast Radio, Digital Audio and  Television. As the indefinite lived intangible assets relating to the Television CGU were fully impaired in the year ended 30 June 2019, and  no indicator of impairment has been identified for the remaining assets based on the Television CGU’s performance for FY2024 relative to  its remaining carrying value, no impairment test was performed on the Television CGU at 30 June 2024.  The recoverable amounts of the  Broadcast Radio and Digital Audio CGUs at 30 June 2024 and the Audio CGU at 30 June 2023 were  determined based on the fair value less costs of disposal (‘FVLCD’) discounted cash flow model utilising probability weighted scenarios,  and approximates the carrying value, except the recoverable amount of the Digital Audio CGU, which exceeds its carrying value. Shared  assets and liabilities in the Audio CGU were allocated to Broadcast Radio and Digital Audio CGUs on the basis of revenues over the  forecast period.

Impairment (continued) Broadcast Radio CGU Impairment  At 30 June 2024, an impairment loss of $326.1 million was recorded against the Broadcasting Licences in the Broadcast Radio CGU,  reflecting a recoverable amount of $275.1 million. The carrying values of the other assets in the Broadcast Radio CGU, including the  Brands and Tradenames, were considered equal to or less than their fair value. After the impairment loss, the estimated recoverable  amount of the Broadcast Radio CGU, based on FVLCD, equals its carrying amount.  The impairment reflects observed market pressures,  independent estimates of radio broadcast growth rates showing declines over the forecast period and a consequent reduction in the long- term growth rates. b) Key assumptions used  30 June 2024  The FVLCD calculations used cash flow projections based on the 2025 Board approved financial budgets extended over the subsequent  four-year period (‘Forecast Period’) and applied a terminal value calculation using estimated growth rates approved by the Board for the  business relevant to the Broadcast Radio and Digital Audio CGUs. In determining appropriate growth rates to apply to the Forecast Period  and to the terminal calculation, the Group considered forecast reports from independent media experts and publicly available broker  reports as well as internal Company data and assumptions. The long-term growth rates in respect of the Broadcast Radio and Digital Audio  CGUs are based on management’s view after considering independent forecast reports. The discount rate used is based on a range  provided by an independent expert and reflects specific risks relating to the Broadcast Radio and Digital Audio CGUs in Australia.  The Group considered three scenarios: the Base case, Lower case and Upper case applying a probability weighting to each scenario as  outlined below to determine a recoverable amount. The key assumptions under each scenario are as follows: Broadcast Radio Lower case Base case Upper case FY25 Budget achievement % 75% 100% 100%  Growth in Broadcast Radio advertising  revenue – 5-year CAGR (1.3)% 1.4% 3.9% Long-term growth rate (1.0)% 0.0% 2.5%  Discount rate (post-tax) 10.25% 10.25% 10.25% Metro market share – Year 5 26% 28.5% 30% Cost out savings – FY26 onwards $6m savings from FY26,  plus additional 1% in FY27  and FY28 $6m savings from FY26 $6m savings from FY26 Probability weighting 40% – lower case  considered more likely  than upper case due to  potential for worsening  market conditions 50% – base case considered  most likely outcome 10% – upper case considered  less likely than lower  case due to potential for  worsening market conditions Digital Audio Lower case Base case Upper case FY25 Budget achievement % 100% 100% 100% Long-term growth rate 1.0% 2.0% 4.5% Discount rate (post-tax) 12.25% 12.25% 12.25% Growth in digital audio revenues –  5-year CAGR 11% 24% 26% Probability weighting 40% – lower case  considered more likely  than upper case due to  potential for worsening  market conditions 50% – base case considered  most likely outcome 10% – upper case considered  less likely than lower  case due to potential for  worsening market conditions  The market capitalisation of the Group at 30 June 2024 was $146 million, which represented a $57 million deficiency against the net  assets of $203 million. The Group considered reasons for this difference and concluded the recoverable amount resulting from the FVLCD  methodology is appropriate in supporting the carrying value of the Broadcast Radio and Digital Audio CGUs. 2024 Annual Report Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements | 65   ===== PAGE 68 ===== 9.	 Impairment (continued) 30 June 2023  The FVLCD calculations used cash flow projections based on the 2024 Board approved financial budgets extended over the subsequent  four-year period (‘Forecast Period’) and applied a terminal value calculation using estimated growth rates approved by the Board for the  business relevant to the Audio CGU. In determining appropriate growth rates to apply to the Forecast Period and to the terminal calculation,  the Group considered forecast reports from independent media experts and publicly available broker reports as well as internal Company  data and assumptions. In respect of the Audio CGU the long-term growth rates did not exceed the average of the independent forecast  reports. The discount rate used is based on a range provided by an independent expert and reflects specific risks relating to the Audio  CGU in Australia. The Group considered three scenarios: the Base case, Lower case, and Upper case and applied a probability weighting to each scenario as  outlined below to determine a recoverable amount. The key assumptions under each scenario are as follows: Audio Lower case Base case Upper case Extent and duration of audio  market recovery To 82% of CPI adjusted  FY19 revenue base in FY25  declining to 76% by FY28 To 83% of CPI adjusted  FY19 revenue base in FY25  declining to 82% in FY26 and  flat thereafter To 84% of CPI adjusted FY19  revenue base by FY25 and  increasing to 88% by FY28 Long term growth rate 0.0% 1.5% 2.5% Discount rate (post-tax) 10.0% 10.0% 10.0% Growth in digital audio revenues –  5-year CAGR 17% 27% 31% Metro market share – Year 5 26% 29% 30% Probability weighting 40% – lower case  considered more likely  than upper case due to  potential for worsening  economic conditions 50% – base case considered  most likely outcome 10% – upper case  considered less likely  than lower case due to  potential for worsening  economic conditions c) Impact of a reasonably possible change in key assumptions  Broadcast Radio CGU Sensitivity  Any variation in the key assumptions used to determine the FVLCD would result in a change in the recoverable amount of the Broadcast  Radio CGU. The assumptions in the lower-case scenario for 30 June 2024 described above represent a reasonably possible change in  assumptions, which together would lead to a further pre-tax impairment of $336 million. The following reasonably possible changes in a  key assumption would result in the following approximate impact on recoverable amount (as derived on a probability weighted basis) and  carrying value for the Broadcast Radio CGU: ﻿ Sensitivity Reasonable  Change in  variable % Impact of  change on  Broadcast  Radio CGU  carrying value $ million Increase in post-tax discount rate from 10.25% to 12.25% 2.0% (41.6) Reduction in long-term growth rate by 2% in each scenario (2.0)% (29.8) FY25 Budget earnings reduced by 5% in each scenario (5.0)% (27.3) Southern Cross Austereo 66 | Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2024  ===== PAGE 69 ===== 10.

The Group applies a simplified  model of recognising lifetime expected credit losses immediately upon recognition. The expected loss rates are historically based on the  payment profile of sales over a period of three years before the end of the current period. Historical loss rates have been adjusted to reflect  current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of customers to settle the receivables. The amount  of the loss allowance is recognised in profit or loss. Where a debt is known to be uncollectible, it is considered a bad debt and written off. Recognition and Measurement Trade Receivables Trade receivables are recognised at fair value, being the original invoice amount and subsequently measured at amortised cost less ECL  provision. Generally, credit terms are for 30 days from date of invoice or 45 days for an accredited agency. 2024 Annual Report Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements | 69   ===== PAGE 72 ===== 11.

SCA received payment of $100 million from ATN in return for its stations broadcasting  advertising tags provided by ATN attached to news and traffic reports. The contract has a term of 20 years, with an option for ATN to  extend it by a further 10 years. The $100 million payment has been recorded on the balance sheet under ‘Deferred Income’ and will be  released to the Income Statement over a 30-year period, unless the contract ends after 20 years at which point the remaining balance will  be recognised as revenue in year 20. This treatment will match the receipt of future broadcasting services, airtime and traffic management  services that the Group is required to provide over the life of the contract. ATN revenue recognised that was included in the deferred income balance at the beginning of the period was $7.1 million. The ATN revenue  recognised of $7.1 million (2023: $7.1 million) has been offset by the recognition of $5.2 million (2023: $5.4 million) in interest expense as the  unwind of discounting. In addition to the payment received from ATN, deferred income represents government grants received and income invoiced in advance.  Government grants relating to costs are deferred and recognised in profit or loss over the period necessary to match them with the costs  that they are intended to compensate. Government grants relating to the purchase of property, plant and equipment are deferred and  recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the related assets.

Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering  the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the  same class of obligations may be small. Provisions are measured at the present value of management’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at  the balance sheet date. The discount rate used to determine the present value reflects current market estimates of the time value of money  and the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as interest expense. Wages and salaries, leave and other entitlements Liabilities for unpaid salaries, salary related costs and provisions for annual leave are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial  Position at the salary rates which are expected to be paid when the liability is settled. Provisions for long service leave and other long-term  benefits are recognised at the present value of expected future payments to be made. In determining this amount, consideration is given  to expected future salary levels and employee service histories. Expected future payments are discounted to their net present value using  high quality corporate bond rates with terms that match as closely as possible to the expected future cash flows. Onerous Contracts A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the  unavoidable costs of meeting the obligation under the contract. Any resultant provision is measured at the lower of the cost of fulfilling the  contract and any compensation or penalties arising from the failure to fulfil it. Lease Provisions The provision comprises of the makegood provisions included in lease agreements for which the Group has a legal or constructive  obligation. The present value of the estimated costs of dismantling and removing the asset and restoring the site is recognised as a  provision. At each reporting date, the liability is remeasured in line with changes in discount rates, estimated cash flows and the timing of  those cash flows. 2024 Annual Report Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements | 71   ===== PAGE 74 ===== Capital Management 12.	 Capital Management Objectives The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to  provide appropriate returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the  cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, maintain a fully  underwritten dividend reinvestment plan, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, buy back existing shares or sell assets to reduce  debt. The Group has taken measures to maintain net debt at a level consistent with a leverage ratio of below 2.0 times. The following  outlines the capital management policies that are currently in place for the Group: Dividend Policy Dividend Payout Ratio The Group has a policy to distribute between 65-85% of underlying financial year Net Profit After Tax. Dividend Reinvestment Plan (‘DRP’) The Group operates a DRP whereby shareholders can elect to receive their dividends by way of receiving shares in the Company instead  of cash. The Company can elect to either issue new shares, or to buy shares on-market. The DRP has been suspended since the 2016  interim dividend. Further details on the Group’s dividends are outlined in note 13. Share buy-back On 24 March 2022 the Group announced its intention to conduct an on-market share buy-back of up to $40 million over the twelve- month period from 8 April 2022 to 7 April 2023. In the year to 30 June 2023, the Group completed its share buy-back programme, with  20,948,644 shares bought for $21.3 million. Debt Facilities Syndicated Debt Facility At 30 June 2024 the Group had a $160 million (2023: $160 million) revolving facility expiring on 10 January 2026. This facility is used as core  debt for the Group and may be paid down and redrawn in accordance with the SFA. Covenants For the duration of the SFA the Banking Group, being Southern Cross Austereo Pty Ltd and its subsidiaries, has a maximum leverage ratio  covenant of 3.5 times and a minimum interest cover ratio of 3.0 times. As at 30 June 2024, the leverage ratio was 1.87 times, and the interest  cover ratio was 8.30 times. Further details on the Group’s debt facilities are outlined in note 16. Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangibles The capital expenditure for 2024 was $2.8 million (2023: $7.5 million) with further additions to intangible assets of $13.0 million (2023:  $13.0 million). Further details on the Group’s fixed assets are outlined in note 7 and on the Group’s intangible assets in note 8.

Ordinary shares in Southern Cross Media Group Limited Ordinary shares entitle the holder to participate in distributions and the proceeds on winding up of the Company in proportion to the  number of and amounts paid on the shares held. On a show of hands, each shareholder present in person and each other person present as a proxy has one vote and upon a poll, each  share is entitled to one vote. Ordinary shares have no par value, and the Company does not have a limited amount of authorised capital. Employee share entitlements The Group operates an EIP for its senior executives. Information relating to the employee share entitlements, including details of shares  issued under the scheme, is set out in the Remuneration Report. Nature and purpose of reserves a) Share-based payments reserve The share-based payments reserve is used to recognise the fair value of future potential shares to be issued to employees for no  consideration in respect of performance rights offered under the Executive Incentive Plans and Long-Term Incentive Plan. During the year  no performance rights vested (2023: nil). In the current year $144,111 has been recognised as an expense (2023: $276,733 expense) in the  Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as the fair value of potential shares to be issued. b) Hedge reserve The hedge reserve is used to record gains or losses on a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge that are recognised in Other  Comprehensive Income. Amounts are reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income when the associated hedged  transaction affects profit or loss.

The facility matures on 9 January 2026 and has an average variable interest rate of 5.9 % (2023: 5.1%).  The Group also has a short-term  $25 million overdraft facility with the ANZ Banking Group, which is renewable on an annual basis each 30 April. The Group’s bank facilities  are denominated in Australian dollars. There are certain financial and non-financial covenants which are required to be met by subsidiaries in the Group. One of these covenants  is an undertaking that the subsidiary is in compliance with the requirements of the facility before any amount may be distributed to the  benefit of the ultimate parent entity, Southern Cross Media Group Limited.

Transaction costs that have been paid or accrued for prior  to the drawdown of debt are classified as prepayments. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Any difference between  the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using  the effective interest method. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement  of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date. Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are expensed over the life of the facility to which they relate. 17.	 Financial Risk Management  The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (the Group’s main exposure to market risk is interest rate risk),  liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk. The Group’s overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial  markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group. The Group uses derivative financial  instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge certain risk exposures. The Risk Management Policy is carried out by management under policies approved by the Board. Senior management of the Group  identify, quantify and qualify financial risks as part of developing and implementing the risk management process. The Risk Management  Policy is a written document approved by the Board that outlines the financial risk management process to be adopted by management.  Specific financial risks that have been identified by the Group are interest rate risk and liquidity risk. a) Interest rate risk Nature of interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the Group’s exposure to the risk that interest rates move in a way that adversely affects the ability of the Group to pay its  interest rate commitments. The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings which are taken out at variable interest rates and  therefore expose the Group to a cash flow risk. Interest rate risk management Whilst there is no formal policy in place mandating hedging levels, it is considered by the Board regularly and SCA has historically hedged  the interest rate risk by taking out floating to fixed rate swaps against a portion of its drawn debt. Such interest rate swaps have the  economic effect of converting borrowings from variable rates to fixed rates. Generally, the Group raises long-term borrowings at variable  rates and swaps them into fixed rates that are lower than those available if the Group borrowed at fixed rates directly. Under the interest  rate swaps, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals (quarterly), the difference between fixed contract rates  and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional principal amounts. Exposure and sensitivity to interest rate risk External borrowings of the Group currently bear an average variable interest rate of 5.9% (2023: 5.1%). In 2020 the Group entered into  $100 million of interest rate swap contracts under which it was obliged to receive interest at variable rates and pay interest at fixed rates  starting in January 2021 at an average fixed rate of 1.04%. These interest rate swap contracts expired in January 2023. In 2023 the Group  entered into $35 million of interest rate swap contracts under which it is obliged to receive interest at variable rates and pay interest at fixed  rates starting in April 2023 at an average fixed rate of 3.6%. These interest rate swap contracts will expire in April 2026. Details on how the Group accounts for the interest rate swap contracts as cash flow hedges are disclosed in note 26.  Derivative financial instruments ﻿ Consolidated 2024 $’000 2023 $’000 Interest rate swap contracts – non-current asset 485 736 Total derivative financial instruments 485 736  Swaps currently in place cover 30% (2023 – 30%) of the variable loan principal outstanding. The fixed interest rates of the swaps is 3.6%  (2023: 3.6%) and the variable rates on the loans are 1.5% (2023: 1.4%) above the 3 months bank bill rate, which at the end of the reporting  period was 4.4% (2023: 3.7%). The swap contracts require settlement of net interest receivable or payable every 3 months. The settlement dates coincide with the dates  on which interest is payable on the underlying debt.

These interest rate swaps are cash flow hedges as they satisfy the requirements for hedge accounting. Any change in fair value of the  interest rate swaps is taken to the hedge reserve in equity in the relevant period. In assessing interest rate risk, management has assumed a +/- 100 basis points movement (2023: +/- 100 basis points) in the relevant interest  rates at 30 June 2024 for financial assets and liabilities denominated in Australian Dollars (‘AUD’).

Financial Risk Management (continued) b) Liquidity risk Nature of liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk of an entity encountering difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities. Liquidity risk management Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed  credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions. The Group and Company have a liquidity management policy which manages  liquidity risk by monitoring the stability of funding, surplus cash or near cash assets, credit facility headroom, anticipated cash in and  outflows and exposure to connected parties.

Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to  the Group. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing  whether the Group controls another entity. The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. Where control of an entity is  obtained during a financial year, its results are included in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income from the date on which  control commences. Where control of an entity ceases during a financial year, its results are included for that part of the year during which  control existed. Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive  Income and Consolidated Statements of Financial Position respectively. 2024 Annual Report Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements | 79   ===== PAGE 82 ===== 20.

The parent entity has not given any unsecured guarantees at 30 June 2024 (2023: nil). c) Contingent liabilities of the parent entity The parent entity did not have any contingent liabilities as at 30 June 2024 (30 June 2023: nil). d) Contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant or equipment As at 30 June 2024, the parent entity had no contractual commitments (30 June 2023: nil). Recognition and Measurement Parent entity financial information The financial information for the parent entity has been prepared on the same basis as the consolidated financial statements, except as set  out on the following page. i) Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint venture entities Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost in the financial statements of the Company, less any impairment charges. ii) Tax consolidation legislation The Company and its wholly-owned Australian controlled entities have implemented the tax consolidation legislation as of  23 November 2005. The Company is the head entity of the tax consolidated group. Members of the group have entered into a tax sharing agreement in order  to allocate income tax expense to the wholly-owned subsidiaries on a stand-alone basis. The tax sharing arrangement provides for the  allocation of income tax liabilities between the entities should the head entity default on its tax payment obligations. The possibility of such  a default is considered remote at the date of this report. Members of the tax consolidated group have entered into a tax funding agreement. The group has applied the group allocation approach  in determining the appropriate amount of current taxes to allocate to members of the tax consolidated group. The tax funding agreement  provides for each member of the tax consolidated group to pay a tax equivalent amount to or from the parent in accordance with their  notional current tax liability or current tax asset. Such amounts are reflected in amounts receivable from or payable to the parent company  in their accounts and are settled as soon as practicable after lodgement of the consolidated return and payment of the tax liability.

Share-Based Payments The Company operates a long-term incentive plan for Executive KMP and certain senior executives. The share-based payment expense for  the year ended 30 June 2024 was $144,111 (2023: $276,733). The following table reconciles the performance rights outstanding at the beginning and end of the year: Number of performance rights 2024 2023 Balance at beginning of the year 945,954 403,052 Granted during the year 1,090,635 1,131,948 Exercised during the year – – Forfeited during the year (519,813) (589,046) Balance at end of year 1,516,776 945,954 Recognition and Measurement  Share-based compensation benefits are provided to employees via certain Employee Agreements. Information relating to these  Agreements is set out in the Remuneration Report. The fair values of entitlements provided are recognised as an employee benefit  expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured at grant date and recognised as an expense over the period  during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the shares.  No performance rights will be awarded under the FY2024  Executive Incentive Plan. The fair value at grant date of the securities granted is adjusted to reflect any market vesting conditions but excludes the impact of any non- market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth targets). Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions  about the number of shares that are expected to be issued. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimate of the number of  shares that are expected to be issued. The employee benefit expense recognised each period takes into account the most recent estimate.  The impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss with a corresponding adjustment to equity. Where the  terms of the share-based payment entitlement are modified in the favour of the employee, the changes are reflected when determining the  impact on profit or loss. 22.

Leases and Other Commitments ﻿ Consolidated 2024 $ 2023 $ Capital commitments Commitments for the acquisition of plant and equipment contracted for at the reporting date but not  recognised as liabilities are payable as follows: Within one year 243 1,556 243 1,556  Other commitments In 2019, the Group entered into a 15-year contract with Broadcast Australia for the outsourcing of the Group’s transmission services to  support both radio and television broadcasting. In addition to the prepayment disclosed in Note 11 b) the Group is committed to annual fees  through to September 2034. Leases From 1 July 2019, the Group recognised right-of-use assets for these leases, except for short-term and low-value leases. The Group leases various premises, IT equipment and vehicles. Premises typically have initial rental periods of 5 to 10 years, with options,  exercisable by the Group, for periods extending the total lease period up to 30 years. Other leases are typically for less than 4 years. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. Extension options are included in a number of property leases across the Group, which provide flexibility in terms of managing the assets  used in the Group’s operations. The extension options are exercisable by the Group, which applies judgement to determine whether these  options are reasonably certain or not. Extension and termination options have been included in all property leases across the Group except  those that are surplus to the Group’s operational requirements. The Group sub-leases buildings under an operating lease and rent revenue is recorded as income in the profit or loss on a  straight-line basis. Where the Group assumes that extension options in leases will be exercised these are included in the calculations for the lease liability  and ROU asset. Twenty-eight leases were renegotiated during the year resulting in a total net lease liability and ROU remeasurements  of $1.0 million.

Rental contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Group allocates the consideration in the contract to the lease and  non-lease components based on their relative stand-alone prices. 25.	 Events Occurring after Balance Date No matters or circumstances have arisen since the end of the financial year that have significantly affected, or may significantly affect, the  operations, results of operations or state of affairs of the Group in subsequent accounting periods. 26.	  Other Accounting Policies Defined contribution scheme The Group operates a defined contribution scheme. The defined contribution scheme comprises fixed contributions made by the Group  with the Group’s legal or constructive obligation being limited to these contributions. Contributions to the defined contribution scheme  are recognised as an expense as they become payable. Prepaid contributions are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial  Position as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available. The defined contribution plan  expense for the year was $18.7 million (2023: $16.8 million) and is included in employee expenses. Derivative financial instruments The Group enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage its financial risks. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the  date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain  or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group  may have derivative financial instruments which are economic hedges, but do not satisfy the requirements of hedge accounting. Gains or  losses from changes in fair value of these economic hedges are taken through profit or loss. 2024 Annual Report Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements | 83   ===== PAGE 86 ===== 26.	Other Accounting Policies (continued) Derivative financial instruments (continued) If the derivative financial instrument meets the hedge accounting  requirements, the Group designates the derivatives as either (1)  hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm  commitment (fair value hedge); or (2) hedges of highly probable  forecast transactions (cash flow hedge). The Group documents at  the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging  instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management  objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.  The Group also documents its assessments, both at hedge  inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that  are used in hedging transactions have been and will continue to  be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows  of hedged items. The fair values of over-the-counter derivatives are determined using  valuation techniques adopted by the Directors with assumptions  that are based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet  date. The fair values of interest rate swaps are calculated as the  present values of the estimated future cash flows. Hedge accounting The Group designated interest rates swaps as cash flow hedges  and has applied hedge accounting from this date. The Group documents the relationship between hedging  instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management  objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transactions. The  Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception  and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used  in hedging transactions have been and will continue to be highly  effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. The fair values of derivative financial instruments used for hedging  purposes are presented within the balance sheet. Movements in  the hedging reserve are shown within the Statement of Changes  in Equity. The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as  a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the  hedged item is more than 12 months; it is classified as a current  asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is  less than 12 months. Derivatives Hedge ineffectiveness Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge  relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness  assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists  between the hedged item and hedging instrument. The Group enters into interest rate swaps that have similar critical  terms as the hedged item, such as reference rate, reset dates,  payment dates, maturities and notional amount. The Group hedges  up to 100% of its loans, and the hedged item is identified as a  proportion of the outstanding loans up to the notional amount of the  swaps. As all critical terms matched during the year, the economic  relationship was 100% effective. The Group therefore performs a qualitative assessment of  effectiveness. If changes in circumstances affect the terms of the  hedged item such that the critical terms no longer match exactly  with the critical terms of the hedging instrument, the Group uses the  hypothetical derivative method to assess effectiveness. Hedge ineffectiveness may occur due to: –	 the credit value/debit value adjustment on the interest rate  swaps which is not matched by the loan; and –	 differences in critical terms between the interest rate  swaps and loans. There was no ineffectiveness during 2024 or 2023 in relation to the  interest rate swaps. Cash flow hedge The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives  that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised  in other comprehensive income and accumulated in reserves  in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion  is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Statement of  Comprehensive Income. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in  the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss (for instance  when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). The gain or  loss relating to the effective portion of interest rate swaps hedging  variable rate borrowings is recognised in profit or loss within  ‘interest expense and other borrowing costs’. When a hedging  instrument expires or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no  longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative  gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is  recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised  in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected  to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is  immediately reclassified to profit or loss.  Fair value estimation The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities  must be estimated for recognition and measurement or for  disclosure purposes. The Group has adopted AASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures  which requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the  following fair value measurement hierarchy: Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical  assets or liabilities; Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that  are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or  indirectly (derived from prices); and Level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on  observable market data (unobservable inputs). The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active  market (for example, unlisted convertible notes) is determined  using valuation techniques. The Group uses a variety of methods  and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions  existing at each balance date. Other techniques, such as estimated  discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for the  remaining financial instruments. The fair value of interest rate swaps  is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows. The nominal values less estimated credit adjustments of trade  receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair  values. The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes  is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the  current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar  financial instruments.  New accounting standards and interpretations The year-end financial statements have been prepared on a basis  of accounting policies consistent with those applied in the 30 June  2023 financial statements. The Group adopted certain accounting  standards, amendments and interpretations during the financial  year, which did not result in changes in accounting policies nor an  adjustment to the amounts recognised in the financial statements.  They also do not significantly affect the disclosures in the Notes to  the consolidated financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis  for our opinion.

We have also  fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.    2024 Annual Report Independent Auditor’s Report | 87   ===== PAGE 90 ===== Our audit approach  An audit is designed to provide reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from  material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if  individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of  users taken on the basis of the financial report.  We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an  opinion on the financial report as a whole, taking into account the geographic and management  structure of the Group, its accounting processes and controls and the industry in which it operates.  Audit Scope  Our audit focused on where the Group made subjective judgements; for example, significant  accounting estimates involving assumptions and inherently uncertain future events.  Key audit matters  Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in  our audit of the financial report for the current period. The key audit matters were addressed in the  context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do  not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Further, any commentary on the outcomes of a  particular audit procedure is made in that context. We communicated the key audit matters to the Audit  and Risk Committee.  Key audit matter  How our audit addressed the key audit matter  Impairment assessment for Broadcast Radio  indefinite lived intangible assets  (Refer to note 9)  As described in note 9, the directors’ determined that  Broadcast Radio and Digital Audio, formerly comprising  the Audio cash generating unit (CGU), had  independent cash inflows and therefore at 30 June  2024 have been identified as separate CGUs.  The Group has significant indefinite lived intangible  assets in the Broadcast Radio CGU, totalling $362.9  million as at 30 June 2024. These are subject to an  annual impairment test by the Group using a fair value  less costs of disposal discounted cash flow model (“the  model”). At 30 June 2024, the Group recognised an  impairment charge of $326.1 million in relation to the  Broadcast Radio CGU licences.  This was a key audit matter due to the size of the  indefinite lived intangible assets in the Broadcast Radio  CGU and on the basis that the impairment test involves  judgemental estimates of future profits and cash flows.  In performing our audit work we considered, amongst  other things:  ● whether the Group’s identification of CGUs is appropriate ● the market capitalisation of the Group in comparison to the carrying value of its net assets ● the appropriateness of adopting a fair value less costs of disposal methodology for estimating the Broadcast Radio CGU’s recoverable amount. To evaluate the model prepared for the directors’  impairment assessment, with assistance from PwC  valuation experts in aspects of our work, we performed  the following procedures, amongst others:  ● sample tested the mathematical accuracy of the model’s calculations Southern Cross Austereo 88 | Independent Auditor’s Report Independent Auditor’s Report to the members of Southern Cross Media Group Limited  ===== PAGE 91 ===== Key audit matter  How our audit addressed the key audit matter  ● assessed the appropriateness of the discount rate incorporated in the model in consideration of the forecasted cash flows ● assessed the appropriateness of the significant assumptions within the model compared to observable market information where available ● evaluated the Group’s historical ability to forecast future cash flows by comparing forecast cash flows with reported actual performance ● considered whether the model’s allocation of corporate costs between CGUs was appropriate and reflective of actual costs incurred ● assessed the sensitivity of changes in significant assumptions incorporated in the model ● compared the Group’s valuation to external data sources including broker reports. We evaluated the reasonableness of the disclosures in  note 9 in light of the requirements of Australian  Accounting Standards.  Indefinite lives classification of intangible assets  (Refer to note 8)  As at 30 June 2024, the Group has intangible assets  totalling $370.3 million, including Radio Broadcasting  Licences, Brands and Tradenames classified as  indefinite lived intangible assets.  This was a key audit matter because determination of  whether or not intangible assets are indefinite lived  involves significant judgement by the Group. The  determination has an impact on the financial report as it  affects whether amortisation is recorded in the  In assessing the classification of indefinite useful lived  intangible assets, we performed the following  procedures, amongst others:  ● considered relevant regulatory developments in the year which could change the licence renewal process or use of the brands ● assessed whether there had been any revocation of radio licences by Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) in the year ● considered the forecasted growth of the 2024 Annual Report Independent Auditor’s Report | 89   ===== PAGE 92 ===== Key audit matter  How our audit addressed the key audit matter  consolidated statement of comprehensive income.  associated cash flows of the assets  ● evaluated the directors’ strategic plans for the intended use of the assets ● compared the Group’s classification of indefinite lived intangible assets against a selection of similar assets held by other industry participants in the radio broadcasting market. We considered the reasonableness of the disclosures  in note 8 with regard to Australian Accounting  Standards.  Other information  The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the  information included in the annual report for the year ended 30 June 2024, but does not include the  financial report and our auditor’s report thereon. Prior to the date of this auditor's report, the other  information we obtained included the Directors’ Report. We expect the remaining other information to  be made available to us after the date of this auditor's report.   Our opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and we do not and will not  express an opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon through our opinion on the financial  report. We have issued a separate opinion on the remuneration report.  In connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information  and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial  report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of  this auditor’s report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are  required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.  When we read the other information not yet received, if we conclude that there is a material  misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to the directors and use our  professional judgement to determine the appropriate action to take.  Responsibilities of the directors for the financial report  The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report in accordance  with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001, including giving a true and fair  view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of  the financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.   Southern Cross Austereo 90 | Independent Auditor’s Report Independent Auditor’s Report to the members of Southern Cross Media Group Limited  ===== PAGE 93 ===== In preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group to  continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the  going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease  operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.  Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial report  Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is  free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that  includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that  an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material  misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material  if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic  decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial report.
