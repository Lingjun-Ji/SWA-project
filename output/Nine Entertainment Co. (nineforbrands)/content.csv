Whilst economic conditions have  been more difficult this year, Nine has risen  to the challenge, continuing to invest in  its premium content, resulting in growth in  audience and revenue share across key  advertising segments and platforms.  In FY23, Nine was the Number 1 Metro  FTA Network and primary channel in our  targeted 25-54s as well as Total People;  Number 1 in BVOD; Number 1 in Talk Radio;  Number 1 in Publishing readership and  Australia’s leading local SVOD business.  On revenue of $2.7 billion, Nine reported  EBITDA of $591 million, down 16% on  FY22. Net Profit after Tax and Minorities  was $262 million, and earnings per share  was 15.7 cents, down 23% on pcp. Whilst  down on the record FY22 result, Nine’s  EBITDA and EPS in FY23 were the second- highest since the Group listed in 2013. During the year, Nine continued to invest  in the content that defines who we  are. This included Australia’s favourite  entertainment brands through shows  like Married At First Sight, The Block and  Lego Masters; key sporting moments  through the State of Origin as well as an  amazing season of NRL, tennis and cricket  including The Ashes and the World Cup.  Nine’s journalists investigated and broke  many key news stories, highlighting to  all of Australia the value and importance  of public interest journalism. Ray Hadley  posted 150 consecutive survey wins in  Sydney Radio, and Stan Originals took  four of the top six spots in both series  and movies on Stan. And of course,  during the year, we secured a deal with  the IOC to make Nine the home of the  Olympic Games for the next decade,  culminating with Brisbane in 2032, and  with Paralympics Australia for the Games  in 2024. We are proud to say that Australia  Belongs at Nine. 1.	 Before Specific Items.

We have a strong balance sheet and  unrivalled diversity in Australian media platforms. Our focus is to  create the best content, distribute it broadly and thereby engage  our audiences and advertisers. In particular, we continue to use our  premium content to build our digital future. FY23 was more challenging than FY22. The local economy  stumbled against a backdrop of higher inflation and rapid interest  rate rises. Nine performed well, maintaining revenue on FY22  and taking market share. Nine recorded Group EBITDA in FY23  of $591 million, our second-highest on record, and Net Profit  After Tax (before Specific Items) of $262 million.  There was some cyclical softness in advertising markets, but  Nine’s ability to create and monetise the best content was  reflected in clear share gains across our unique suite of platforms  – Television, Radio and Publishing. In FTA, our market-leading  revenue share was above 40% in FY23, which is the highest  share recorded by any broadcaster since OZTAM began  collecting data in 2001. We reported growth in Digital revenue  and EBITDA from our wholly owned businesses, and our success  in diversifying the drivers of revenue is shown by subscription  revenue now contributing 28% of the wholly-owned total.  Nine continued to implement its previously announced on-market  buy-back. Since it began in September 2022, Nine has bought  back around 78 million shares, or just under 5% of issued capital  – reflecting both our strong balance sheet and conviction in the  value and future opportunities of Nine’s business. Across the financial year, Nine also announced fully franked  dividends of 11 cents per share, totalling $182 million, and  consistent with our stated policy of a 60-80% payout.  Content is the key to Nine’s business and will be instrumental in  our future success. Across all our platforms – Total Television,  Radio, Publishing, Stan and Domain – Nine is focused on our  audiences, the content they want, and how best to distribute  and monetise it. Through 2023, we have been very pleased  with the performance of our content – with strong audiences in  Television, Talk Radio and Publishing resulting in further growth  in revenue share. Of course, premium content comes at a cost. This year the  Federal Court handed down its decision in the defamation  case brought against The Age and the Sydney Morning Herald  by Mr Roberts-Smith. It is now on appeal by Mr Roberts-Smith.  The legal costs have been high, in many ways unprecedented.  We don’t receive taxpayer funds to cover the cost of litigation.  It is borne by the Company and ultimately the shareholders.  The Board believed this was a matter of genuine public interest  and committed the resources to defending that position in Court. We believe that sport will remain a key driver of Television  into the future, and to this end we have recently renewed our  agreement with Tennis Australia through to 2029 and brought  the Olympics back to Nine for the next 10 years – the next five  Games through to Brisbane in 2032. We will also broadcast the  Paralympics in 2024. We are excited about the opportunities  these events, including the NRL through to 2027, will give  6 Nine Entertainment Co. 6 Nine Entertainment Co.  ===== PAGE 9 ===== across all of our businesses – Television, Radio, Publishing and  Streaming. We are committed to maximising the value of our  partnerships with the various sporting bodies who conduct these  competitions. We believe the Olympics, and the Paralympics, epitomise Nine  – the broadcaster of premium events that bring all of Australia  together. We will bring those unforgettable Olympic and  Paralympic moments to all screens, all publications and all audio  and we will join with our audiences and advertisers to celebrate  Australia as a sporting nation. We continue to work with the Government on a range of  regulatory issues, all of which we believe could have a marked  impact on Australia’s media sector. The Government has stated  its support for requiring free-to-air television and apps from  Australian free-to-air television networks to be in a prominent  position on screens, such as connected televisions, to ensure  the continued relevance of locally made and focused content.  We look forward to the Government progressing laws to give  effect to that commitment.  The Government is also looking to make substantial reforms  to the Privacy Act 1988. We continue to caution against the all- encompassing changes which are being considered, including  the right to sue media outlets for breaches of privacy which  would harm our valued freedom of the press. This would clearly  not be in the broader public interest.  And whilst we support the Government’s objectives to develop  the local production industry, we believe that its proposed policy  to impose Australian content quotas on all streaming services  would lead to damaging unintended consequences such as  stretching finite creative and production resources which would  diminish quality and significantly increase costs for Australian  production. Across all of these issues, we continue to work  cooperatively with the Government to ensure a suitable outcome  for the Australian media industry and our Australian audiences. Much has been written, particularly over the past six months,  about the impact of Artificial Intelligence (or AI), and specifically  Generative AI on the media sector, as well as the rest of the  Australian economy. Over the past 12 months, both the Board and  management team have spent time assessing how Nine currently  uses AI, what the opportunities are for further development  of these uses and new initiatives that could be implemented.  We also see potential for Nine to use AI to drive significant  longer-term benefits across content production, optimisation  and commercialisation throughout the business.  Of course there will be challenges. We see the biggest challenge  being our content and our data being used or ‘mined’ for training  AI models that could eventually produce future copy without  human intervention. This would mean the past and current work  of journalists and our intellectual property being used, without  fair compensation, to compete back against them in future news  reporting. A model for fair compensation could be the News  Media Bargaining Code where large digital platforms that are  using third party content to drive their business models are  required to fairly compensate the owners of that content.  This year, we have furthered our commitment to Community,  Company and Climate after completing our initial Materiality  Assessment, and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)  Policy last year. We appointed global sustainability consultants  South Pole as our partner, to help with progressing our planning  on carbon reduction. We have also actively engaged through  industry steering groups Sustainable Screens Australia, the  AANA, the IAB and Commercial Radio & Audio.  After a thorough search to fill the Board vacancy created  when Nick Falloon retired, we welcomed Mandy Pattinson  to the Board in August. Mandy has a wealth of experience in  the Australian media sector, and brings particular strength in  premium subscription television content and multi-platform  strategies. We believe Mandy adds valuable skills to our Board  as we continue to navigate and build Nine’s position within the  Australian media sector. I would like to thank our CEO Mike Sneesby and his leadership  team, on behalf of our Board and all our shareholders, for  ensuring the continued focus and momentum of the business.  Nine is well positioned and continues to gain ground in a  competitive market – a testament to the management team and  their vision and implementation.  We are excited about where our business is, but we do not lose  sight of the challenges ahead. We believe we are in a leading  position to weather those challenges and emerge a stronger, and  more innovative Australian media company.  Thank you. PETER COSTELLO, AC Chairman Annual Report 2023 7 Annual Report 2023 7 Overview Corporate Governance Directors’ Report Operating and Financial Review Financial Statements Shareholder Information Corporate Directory  ===== PAGE 10 ===== Nine finished 2023 in an incredibly strong position,  notwithstanding the challenging operating environment.  Over the past year, the relative position of each of our  businesses – Total Television, Streaming, Radio, Publishing  and Marketplaces – has been further strengthened. This has resulted from Nine’s clear strategy and execution across  the Company – particularly through our focus and investment  in content, technology and data. We remain committed to  developing and delivering the content and public interest  journalism that Australians want across Nine’s breadth of  platforms – attracting larger audiences and creating greater  targeted and cross-platform opportunities for advertisers – as we  continue to challenge the traditional paradigms in the markets in  which we operate. Across Total Television, Radio and Publishing, we have gained  share against our traditional competitors. But the opportunity  today is far greater than those traditional media categories.  The Digital Video, Digital Audio and Digital Publishing markets  are all growing and, in some cases, are already larger than their  traditional counterparts. Our business has embraced the opportunities presented,  extending Nine’s content across these evolving digital platforms.  This broad distribution base delivers us a reach of around  20 million people each month and our extensive signed-in  user base enables us to offer advertising solutions across the  consumer lifecycle and the marketing funnel. We have a strong balance sheet and cash flow and will continue  to look for opportunities to further strengthen our position in  Australia’s media landscape. In FY23, Nine reported EBITDA of $591 million, our second- highest result since listing in 2013. The clear highlight of the year  was our share performance, both audience and revenue across  all of our platforms, which continued its positive trajectory. For the  year, Nine achieved a 20-year high for Metro FTA revenue share,  up 2.5 percentage points on FY22 to 40.7%; a 49.1% revenue  share in BVOD and growth in Radio with a market-leading share  of streaming audiences. Our content and journalism underpinned  around 9% growth in Subscription and Licensing revenue at  Nine’s wholly owned businesses, Stan and Publishing, now  accounting for 28% of total Group revenue, as Nine continues to  successfully diversify its revenue base. This outperformance reflects the targeted and considered  investments in content that Nine continues to make – be it  innovative new strips for television like The Summit and My Mum,  Your Dad, timely content in news and public interest journalism,  extended content in Publishing in genres like Good Food and  Traveller, new cross-platform sports or unique Stan Originals –  these investments are paying off and solidifying Nine’s position  as Australia’s Media Company. In an evolving video market, the value of premium sports rights  is clear. Major sporting events like the State of Origin show us  year in, year out that audiences and advertisers are committed  and engaged in premium sports, while a season of the NRL  provides audience consistency. Sport drives audiences to a  destination, acting as a strong promotional platform for Nine’s  other content, across all platforms. Our unique model enables us  to offer unrivalled exposure to the largest audiences (across free  and subscription television) with the media assets to support that  coverage and build fan engagement. We are pleased to have our key sports of NRL and Tennis,  as well as Rugby Union and UEFA, locked in for the longer  term. And during the year, we reached an agreement with the  IOC, locking in the next five Olympics for Nine with exclusive  broadcast rights to the Olympic Games all the way to Brisbane  2032. Across Publishing, Audio and Television (including  CEO’S ADDRESS ‘Nine’s broad base of  revenue and scale enables  us to maintain investment  in content and product’ 8 Nine Entertainment Co. 8 Nine Entertainment Co.  ===== PAGE 11 ===== Streaming), Nine will bring the 2024 Paris Olympics and  Paralympics to all Australians, with an unprecedented cross- platform strategy. The performance of our Total Television business was  underpinned by Nine’s content – the Australian Open,  Married At First Sight, The Block and the NRL and of course  augmented by our leading News and Current Affairs coverage.  Whilst competition for eyeballs continues to increase, it is  clear that great content continues to be rewarded with strong  audience performance. The value of Total Television is becoming  clear to both audiences and advertisers as we continue to make  in-roads into the $3.4 billion digital video market. The global subscription streaming market continues to evolve as  major US studios begin to shift their strategic focus away from  direct-to-consumer distribution to an increased focus on content  licensing and profitability. Stan remains focused on profitable  growth; and in FY23 not only did we grow our sport and original  content offering, but we also grew subscribers and profitability.  FY23 was Stan’s fourth year of profit and positive cash flow. Stan’s strategic positioning in Originals and Sport, alongside the  best of global licensed content, coupled with an active subscriber  base approaching 2.6 million and strong P&L, stands it in good  stead as the global market continues to evolve and international  streamers rationalise their approach. Stan’s position as part of  Nine creates significant benefits from content acquisition and  production to marketing and cross-promotion. In FY23, Nine’s Publishing business reported EBITDA of  $165 million, with Digital accounting for more than 60% of  revenue. We are incredibly proud of the work our journalists  do to ensure the Australian public is reliably informed about the  news they care about. Be it the day’s biggest stories, award- winning investigative journalism or engaging lifestyle content,  Nine is there. Strong audience engagement enabled us to lift  digital subscription prices, for the first time since the introduction  of digital packages. We see further opportunities for Nine  Publishing to grow its footprint and engage more deeply with  more consumers. One of the key challenges for media in Australia is the impact  of the global digital platforms and their increasing presence  in the Australian market. We want to maintain a future that  ensures Australia’s voices and key moments are heard, shared  and celebrated with maximum potential audiences. As Peter  highlighted in his letter, we continue to work with the Government  through issues like prominence on connected devices, streaming  quotas and anti-siphoning to ensure the health and security of  Australia’s media companies; and are confident we share the  same values and ambitions. The further development of AI, artificial intelligence, creates  similar challenges – but also opportunities for our business.  AI is already embedded in many of Nine’s current operations  – including user segmentation and engagement optimisation  across our 14.2 million signed-in 9Now user-base, as well as  personalised content recommendations and process automation  across our publishing assets and at Stan. We also see potential  for Nine to use AI to drive meaningful longer-term benefits in  content production, operational efficiency and commercialisation  throughout the business. Of course there will be challenges as well, the most immediate  being that of companies utilising our content and data as the  basis for training AI Platforms. This is not unlike the benefits the  digital platforms receive from Nine’s content, which resulted in  mutually beneficial commercial agreements supported by the  News Media Bargaining Code. We continue to look for positive  engagement with the Government to address the potential risks  which the growth of AI will pose to the local media landscape.  In a difficult property market, Domain has made clear progress  diversifying its revenue base, and building on the foundations  of its Marketplace Strategy. Whilst its result was impacted by  markedly lower listing volumes around Australia in FY23, we  remain confident about the Group’s strategy and long-term future  and continue to explore mutually beneficial ways our two groups  can work together.  Over the second half of the year, the Executive team has again  been focused on the development of our long-term plan, and  the setting of our strategic priorities. We continue to remain very  focused on the long-term positioning and growth of Nine and,  notwithstanding the general operating environment, can see  real progress and opportunities across each of our businesses  – Television including Streaming, whether it is subscription  or advertising based, Digital Publishing, Total Audio and  Marketplaces – and all have opportunities to strengthen their  relative position, and to grow. The Board has been engaged  throughout the process, and I thank them for their support and  insights along the way. Whilst the current market conditions remain challenging,  Nine’s broad base of revenue and scale enables us to maintain  investment in content and product. This is expected to result in  further improvement in Nine’s competitive position through the  cycle, while the Group also remains disciplined around operating  costs and underlying efficiencies. Nine’s strong cash flow and  balance sheet enables the continuation of the buy-back and  a targeted 60-80% dividend payout, as well as providing the  flexibility to consider strategic investments that will underpin the  longer-term growth of the business. Once again, I would like to  thank the team and acknowledge their focus and determination,  notwithstanding the more difficult economic backdrop which has  challenged the entire industry. Nine has risen to this challenge  and continues to build its audience and revenue share, and  invest in its future. A difficult economic environment creates challenges, but Nine’s  strategy and momentum, strong market position and balance sheet  also create an opportunity to further strengthen our competitive  position – we remain committed to seizing that opportunity. Thank you.

Reflecting the strong performance of Nine’s programming  slate and the benefit of the Group’s continued investment in  its content, Nine gained revenue share, with a market-leading  41.8% across the year, up 2.8pts on FY22. As a result, Nine’s Total  TV revenues were down by just 2%, with the growth in digital  revenues (9Now) partially offsetting the decline in free-to-air  (Nine Network). Around 15% of Nine’s Total Television revenues  in FY23 were digital, up from around 13% in FY22.  Total TV costs increased by just under 7% as Nine continued  to invest in its high quality schedule, with incremental sports,  entertainment content and a continual refresh of the core.  Specific investments included sports like the T20 Cricket  World Cup and UK Ashes as well as entertainment content like  The Summit, the format for which has subsequently been sold  offshore, and dating series, My Mum, Your Dad. In addition,  Nine invested in the 9Now platform, ensuring Nine’s strength in  the BVOD and broader digital video market continued. These  investments enabled the strong growth in revenue share, as the  traditional television market paradigm continues to be tested.  Total Television EBITDA in FY23 declined by 20% to $307 million.  Whilst down on FY22’s record year, FY23 was Nine’s second- most profitable year from Total Television over the past 10 years.

And  while linear television continues to account for the majority of  the audience, Nine is experiencing strong growth in the other  platforms, particularly live streaming, as consumers turn to 9Now  for their linear (live) television consumption. In FY23, almost half  of 9Now’s viewing was of live content, with the balance being  catch-up, as audiences increasingly embrace digital delivery.  News and Current Affairs, Sport and Entertainment are the three  key content genres of Nine’s Total Television business.  News & Current Affairs Nine’s commitment to news is evidenced across the entire  business. Breaking stories, shared footage, depth of analysis  and cross-platform usage of talent are all benefitted by Nine’s  portfolio of assets – across Television, Radio and Publishing.  Nine’s newsroom is uniquely designed to enable our businesses  to maximise interaction and efficiency.  Further reflecting Nine’s broader commitment to news, during  2023 Nine undertook a number of major joint investigations,  delivered across multiple distribution platforms. The exposé on  sex trafficking and border security in Australia which resulted in  the Stan documentary Revealed:Trafficked was based on the  60 Minutes story first reported by Nine’s award-winning journalist,  Nick McKenzie, in collaboration with The Age and The Sydney  Morning Herald. Nine’s leading investigative podcast Hannah’s  Story was a result of the collaboration between Nine’s podcasts  team and Queensland’s news and radio teams and received a  Kennedy Award for Outstanding Podcast.  News and Current Affairs is also the backbone to Nine’s regular  television schedule with more than 60 hours of broadcast  content across Nine and 9now each week of the year. This core  of news provides the network with reliable audiences at scale,  with Nine’s nightly 6pm bulletin, attracting more than one  million Australians each night, forming an important lead-in to  each evening’s entertainment schedule and epitomising Nine’s  Purpose – Australia Belongs Here.  Younger Australians are also connecting with 9News in record  numbers on social media platforms. 9News is Australia’s most  engaged news brand across Facebook and Instagram1. Vertical  video content is watched 50 million times monthly across  TikTok, Instagram and Facebook2. Nine’s digital audience growth  continues on YouTube with 1.22 million subscribers choosing  9News as their premium source of news3.  At the end of 2022, after 17 years, Tracy Grimshaw stepped  down as host of A Current Affair. Grimshaw, a Walkley-award  winning journalist, first joined Nine as a reporter in the Melbourne  newsroom in 1981 before she began presenting 9News daytime  bulletins four years later. In 1996, she became the co-host of  Today, before making the move to A Current Affair in 2006.  1.	 CrowdTangle Intelligence report, 12 months to August 2023. 2.	 Internal data for Nine + Crowdtangle, July 2023. 3.	 YouTube data. At ACA, Tracy prided herself  on telling the stories that  matter to her viewers, which  included prime ministers,  Hollywood stars, sports  icons and everyone in  between. At the start of 2023, Ally  Langdon made her debut at  A Current Affair, moving from  Nine’s Today show which  she had co-hosted for three  years. The transition has  been smooth with audiences  holding above 900,000  each night and social  feedback very positive about  the next stage of ACA.  Sport Sport is also a key pillar to  Nine’s Total Television strategy,  attracting similarly reliable  and committed audiences. In  FY23, Nine broadcast more  than 1,900 hours of premium sports content, as well as a further  177 hours of sport-related content. Nine’s broad coverage  through free linear and streaming is complemented by the  deeper offering of Stan, while Nine’s radio and publishing assets  can be employed to further the exposure of its key sports.  The core of Nine’s sporting coverage is the NRL, with Nine  holding broadcast and live, free streaming rights through to the  end of season 2027. In season 2023, Nine’s broadcast of the  NRL performed well, with average audiences up 3% on 2022 and  with 9Now accounting for almost 10% of the 500,000-plus total.  The State of Origin in 2023 confirmed our long-held view that  audiences will find the right content. Game one attracted a total TV  audience of a massive 3.4 million, with all of Metro, Regional and  BVOD recording double-digit growth on 2022. Records tumbled  at the time, including the largest-ever live streaming audience in  Australia. Across the series, audiences grew by 2% to an average  of around 3 million viewers.  Nine also broadcast the Women’s State of Origin series in FY23,  which attracted an average audience of more than 600,000  across the two-match series, up 34% on the 2022 game; with  9Now audiences up 110% to 10% of the total. The 2023 Australian Open boasted record attendance despite  the absence of some big name players, as Melbourne got out and  about once again after two years of COVID disruptions. After an  enormous 2022, with Ash Barty, the Special Ks, and Dylan Alcott,  television audiences were down on the record levels of 2022.  Notwithstanding, across the fortnight, Tennis on Nine reached  a national audience of 11.8 million people, while 525 million live  Respected journalist Ally Langdon  joined Australia’s No. 1 daily  current affairs program,  A Current Affair, as host in 2023. 12 Nine Entertainment Co. 12 Nine Entertainment Co.  ===== PAGE 15 ===== minutes were streamed through 9Now. In terms of minutes viewed,  9Now accounted for around 10% of the total, up from 7.6% in 2022.  In November, Nine entered into an agreement with Tennis  Australia for the rights to all premium tennis played in Australia  for the 2025-2029 seasons, extending Nine’s partnership with  Tennis Australia for a further five years. During the year, Nine also  showed its year-round commitment to the sport, augmenting its  Australian Open coverage with the other Grand Slams – Roland- Garros, US Open and Wimbledon shown across Nine and Stan.  In February, Nine announced that it had secured the rights to the  next five Olympics, culminating in Brisbane in 2032. This is a long- term strategic investment for Nine across Total TV, Stan, Publishing  and Radio. It is complementary to the existing sports portfolio  which drives audiences to a destination and also acts as a strong  promotional platform for our network programs. The longevity of  the deal will allow Nine to build value in the partnership on the  road to Brisbane, driving consumption across Nine and growth for  9Now and Stan over the long term, as it helps define Nine’s digital  platforms as the destination of choice for Australia.  In a separate agreement, Nine has also secured the exclusive  free and subscription audio-visual and audio rights for the  Paris 2024 Paralympic Games, complementing Nine’s already  extensive sporting line-up. Every Olympic Games delivers iconic sporting moments that  engage and unite Australia. Nine will bring these moments to  Australia across its breadth of platforms like never before. Live  broadcast across FTA, streamed not just through 9Now and  Stan, but also embedded in the Group’s Publishing platforms  and Audio assets. On big screens, on tablets and on phones.  The broadcast of the Olympic Games provides huge growth  opportunities, leveraging short-term uplift in consumption to  establish longer-term behaviours. Entertainment The third key pillar of Total Television is Entertainment content,  and Nine continues to demonstrate that it has the most popular  and resilient entertainment brands. Over the past few years,  Nine’s strategy has been to develop and trial new concepts  around the core of proven strips – and 2023 was no different.  Nine’s proven brands continue to perform and, in some cases,  grow their total television audiences. Season 18 of The Block,  Travel Guides, Love Island and Married At First Sight are all  evidence that good content will always find an audience.  In particular, The Block in October 2022 continued to be a  proven time slot winner. The average audience of more than  1.6 million viewers across Australia for each episode equated  to growth of 5% over season 17. 9Now accounted for a growing  share of total audience – 17% in FY23, up from 14% in FY22.  For the latest season of Married At First Sight, Total Television  audiences also grew, a result of 24% growth in live streaming  coupled with 22% growth in catch-up audiences – making MAFS  Australia’s biggest strip for the year. Across the year, Love Island Australia was complemented by  the Love Islands UK and US which all drew young and dedicated  audiences, primarily on 9Now. Of Love Island Australia’s 450,000  average audience across the season, around 77% were 9Now  viewers, making it one of Nine’s key pieces of content across the  year. Across all the Love Islands, around 1.9 billion minutes were  streamed across FY23.  During the year, Nine continued to invest in new content and  concepts. The Summit launched in May, with audiences building  throughout the season and the subsequent sale of the concept  offshore. My Mum, Your Dad launched in late 2022. Both of these  reflect Nine’s focus on owning many of its creative concepts and  IP (intellectual property) looking forward.  In May, with the long-awaited roll-out of VirtualOz (VOZ), the  Television industry prepared to change the way it reports and  analyses audience data. VOZ is an industry-wide ratings product  that brings together broadcast viewing on TV sets and connected  devices to provide all-screen, cross-platform reporting for  Australia’s Total Television industry. For the first time, the industry  will be able to accurately measure and sell Total Television reach,  a key buying metric for advertisers which, despite the enormous  evolution of television over the past 10 years, has held well  over that time period. No other two mediums can be combined  and measured in a consistent, de-duplicated way. Moreover,  VOZ enables the measurement of co-viewing, for the first time  allowing broadcasters and marketers to more accurately estimate  audiences rather than just devices. It is expected that VOZ will  become the industry-wide trading currency in calendar 2024. Nine now has three unique ways to monetise Total Television  content – linear Free To Air, and Broadcast Video on Demand,  both live streaming and catch-up.  9News Sydney chief  newsreader Peter  Overton celebrated  22 years with Nine  in 2023.

Nine recorded a market leading share of Metro  FTA revenues for the year of 40.7%, up from 38.2% in FY22,  underpinned by Nine’s strong content and ratings performance.  Total FTA revenue declined by a modest 4% with share gains  across both metro markets and regional (both affiliate revenues  from WIN as well as wholly-owned Northern NSW and Darwin)  offsetting much of the underlying market weakness.  FY23 was another strong ratings year for Nine. For the year  to June, Nine was the #1 Free To Air Network in all of the key  demographics – in Nine’s targeted 25-54s, Nine was the clear  leader on both a Network and main channel basis, 5.7 points  and 6.8 points respectively ahead of its nearest rival.

Nine recorded the market leading share of  BVOD revenues for the year of 49.1%, resulting in revenue growth  of 16% to $176 million.  9Now continues to record strong growth in audiences. Growth in  live streams of 21% again outpaced growth in on-demand  viewing (+6%) and now accounts for around 50% of total streams.  From initially being established as a catch-up service for past  Nine content, 9Now continues to evolve and is expected to  further grow audiences as viewers embrace streamed delivery  of their Total Television content.  9Now’s success primarily reflects the strength of Nine’s core  network content. However, targeted content continues to be  added to 9Now to augment Nine’s core network content –  content like Love Island which brings incremental viewing and  minutes to 9Now. Nine has also continued to invest in the key technologies behind  9Now, with better-than-broadcast picture quality and startover  two key additions through FY23.  Nine’s opportunity is to gain an increasing share of the  overall digital video market, estimated currently to be more  than $3.4 billion, and dominated by YouTube and Facebook.  Beyond Nine’s premium content, 9Now has clear advantages  over these global platforms – a brand safe environment,  unskippable ads and a third party, auditable measuring system.  The rollout of Virtual Oz, which brings broadcast viewing on  TV sets and connected devices together in a single database,  will also enable Nine to sell the de-duplicated reach of Total  Television – a key opportunity looking forward.  Novak Djokovic  made history  at the 2023  Australian  Open on  Channel Nine  and 9Now –  winning his  tenth AO and  equalling the  men’s Grand  Slam record.

Nine also owns music stations in three of the same  markets through Magic 1278, 2UE and 4BH, which are operated  by Ace Radio. In FY23, the total linear radio market (through Nine’s four markets)  was broadly flat at ~$625 million, with Nine’s revenue growing by  1%. Total revenues at Nine Radio grew by 4% to $106 million of  which $4.3 million, up 115%, were digital or streaming revenues,  the key growth segment of the market. Costs increased by 8%  due to the associated investment in digital and other content,  coupled with higher sales and marketing costs, resulting in  EBITDA of $13 million for the year. Nine’s live and local content continued to resonate  in FY23, with 3AW maintaining its dominance in the  Melbourne market. 3AW returned #1 results overall, as  well as in Breakfast and Mornings across each of the  eight surveys. 2GB won six of the eight surveys overall,  with Breakfast dominating three surveys in the most  contested and competitive radio market in Australia. 2GB  Mornings continued its winning tally notching up a record  150 consecutive survey victories. In June, industry body Commercial Radio & Audio (CRA)  launched Radio 360, the new audience measurement  system which incorporates streaming audiences for each  radio station alongside total and broadcast audience  figures, enabling a rank of networks and stations according  to the new metric.  The first Radio 360 survey highlighted what Nine has known  for some time – the power of talk radio. From a streaming  perspective, Nine’s talk stations in Melbourne and Sydney  recorded leading audience shares, well above the traditional  metrics, with talk far outpacing music radio in a streaming  environment.  Around 22% of Nine’s audience are now streaming Nine  Radio, with the associated single sign-on (SSO), enabling  data and analysis of audience composition and preferences  across all of Nine’s ecosystem. Nine is committed to  broadening its current podcast offering, focusing on Sport,  Entertainment and long form narrative podcasts. The extension of  Radio’s traditional content into podcasts is expected to provide  incremental opportunities for audiences and advertisers. In May, Nine launched Hannah’s Story, which immediately  shot to Number 1 on the Australian charts. Nine’s Queensland  Newsreader, Melissa Downes, and producer Jess Lodge, were  behind this powerful retelling of the events that led to the horrific  death of Hannah Clarke and her three children on a Brisbane  street three years ago, at the hands of her abusive partner.  It is a further example of collaboration across Nine, across  Television, Radio and Publishing and also Sales, which ensured  the commercial success of the podcast series.

As consumers enter Nine’s ecosystem, and engage with Nine’s  content, the Group has an opportunity to gather data and  intelligence on user habits and preferences. The benefit of this  is two-fold. Firstly, it enables the analysis of content consumption  – what works and what doesn’t and with whom – helping to  support future content investment and inform digital product  development; and secondly, it enables the delivery of more  relevant advertising – a benefit to the consumer, advertisers and  Nine, as advertisers will pay a premium for effective targeting. With an increasing focus on privacy, the recent changes to  Apple’s iOS settings and the expected phasing out of third party  cookies by Google from January 2024, Nine’s access to this  leading pool of first party data (information a company collects  directly from its customers and owns) is expected to become  increasingly important and valuable.  With a broad range of platforms to contribute to this data pool,  and a similarly broad range of platforms to distribute content and  advertise through, Nine is well placed to continue to grow its data  revenue. In FY23, Nine’s revenue from data increased by 16% to  $115 million.

Revenue growth in FY23 was underpinned by 9% growth in  ARPU (average revenue per user), reflecting the success of price  increases for both Stan Entertainment (in September 2022) and  Stan Sport (March 2023) during the financial year. This ability  to raise pricing, with limited impact on churn, reflects Stan’s  confidence in its content slate and the engagement of its  subscriber base. It also contributed to Stan’s 30% growth in  EBITDA, despite costs increasing by 11% as a result of new first  run content and increased investment in Originals and Sport. Stan has forged a unique position in the Australian market as the  only subscription streaming service to offer the combination of  domestic and international TV and movies as well as live sports  and pay per view events all in one place. Over the past two  years, as well as aggregating key content from the Hollywood  Studios, including Starz Lionsgate, Sony, Paramount, NBCU and  Warner Bros Discovery, Stan has been focused on furthering its  differentiation from the global DTC operators through growth  in both Originals and Sport. Furthermore, as a profitable local  player, with approaching 2.6 million active subscribers (more  than 2.2 million paying) and a registered subscriber base of  approximately 9 million since inception, Stan is truly unique.  IN FY23, STAN REPORTED EBITDA  OF $37M (+30%) ON REVENUES  OF $428M (+12%).  STAN 18 Nine Entertainment Co. 18 Nine Entertainment Co.  ===== PAGE 21 ===== Across the year, Stan continued to expand its commitment to Stan  Originals, launching 21 new titles. Original projects are developed  and commissioned with a broad range of partners, both local  and offshore, with Stan retaining exclusive rights in the Australian  market. Stan achieved particularly strong viewership in FY23 with  new Original series such as Black Snow, Poker Face, Ten Pound  Poms, Bali 2002 and Totally Completely Fine complementing  returning series such as Bump and Ru Paul’s Drag Race Down  Under as well as Original movies including Transfusion, Poker  Face and The Portable Door. Over the past 12 months, Stan  Originals have accounted for four of the six most viewed features  and four of the most viewed series on the platform. They have  also featured across many of the world’s leading networks  and platforms including Hulu, Peacock, Paramount+, BBC and  HBO Max.  Stan also made its first foray into reality television with Love  Triangle, from the producers of Nine smash hit Married At First  Sight (Endemol Shine). Releasing eight weekly episodes, Love  Triangle attracted a young and dedicated audience and will  return for a second season in 2024. In a cross-platform approach to content that is unique to Nine,  Stan continues to work closely with Nine’s award-winning  journalists as well as key filmmakers and philanthropists from  Australia and around the world – and with support from Screen  NSW, VicScreen, Shark Island Foundation and Fremantle – to  develop the Revealed series of Original documentaries. In FY23,  these series included Trafficked, inside the world of human  trafficking in Australia; Reefshot, documenting efforts to protect  the Great Barrier Reef from the effects of climate change;  and The Cape, a haunting documentary about the mysterious  tragedies befalling an isolated community in Australia’s Cape York.

Annual Report 2023 19 Annual Report 2023 19 Overview Corporate Governance Directors’ Report Operating and Financial Review Financial Statements Shareholder Information Corporate Directory  ===== PAGE 22 ===== STAN This investment in Originals is significant as it not only  differentiates Stan’s offering from the global players by bringing  the best local stories to Australian audiences, but it also creates  the foundations of a long-term content library asset. Stan will  again increase its output of original productions in 2024.  Stan also continued to bring high quality licensed content  to Australian audiences including popular shows such as  Yellowstone, Power, Your Honour and From. During the year, Stan  signed a new multi-year output deal with Sony which saw the  launch of new titles such as Lucky Hank and Panhandle and the  successful release of the highly anticipated series Twisted Metal,  based on the Playstation game. Towards the end of the year, Stan  announced the successful acquisition of three new spin-offs to the  global smash hit franchise The Walking Dead from AMC, a new  partner, with the first of these titles Dead City released in June. Live streaming provides another key point of differentiation  compared with its competitors – across entertainment and  Stan Sport. During the year, Stan launched its first forays into  entertainment live streaming, broadcasting the Queen’s funeral,  Golden Globes and the King’s Coronation event. Stan also  strengthened its Stan Sport proposition; extending key  partnerships with Rugby Australia; Grand Slam tennis events  the Australian Open, Roland Garros and Wimbledon; as well  as the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). Stan  also continues to provide access to other high quality sporting  competitions, with international and domestic motorsport  including Formula E, INDYCAR, World Endurance Championship,  World Rally Championship, SpeedSeries, Australian Superbike  Championship, Australian Pro MX and FIM Motocross as  well as the emerging MMA competition, the Professional  Fighters League, which during FY23 announced the additions  of superstars Jake Paul and Francis Ngannou to its line-up.  Stan Sport’s strategy is premised on delivering premium sports  with large and committed supporter bases via its high quality  platform. The unique combination of sport and entertainment is  a significant point of difference for Stan and continues to drive  high engagement among subscribers and positive contribution  to the business. Stan Sport also enables Nine to offer a whole of television  approach to Sport, a benefit for both Nine and the relevant  sporting bodies who value the merits of Nine’s whole of company  commitment, with audiences and editorial focus across both free  and subscription platforms.  Stan also offers subscribers access to premium Pay Per View  events and in FY23 Stan brought audiences two big fight nights  headlined by Joseph Parker vs Joe Joyce in September, followed  by the blockbuster match-up between Sonny Bill Williams and  former UFC star Mark Hunt in November. Stan’s continued success is taking place in an ever-changing  global streaming landscape, where global streaming services  have significantly pivoted their strategies from a focus on building  global subscriber numbers at any cost (often by launching  direct-to-consumer offerings in a large number of markets) to  a renewed focus on profitability. As a consequence, a number  of the global players are expected to evolve their strategies in  Australia, with some returning to a third party licensing model for  some of their content. With a profitable active subscriber base  approaching 2.6 million, as well as an inactive subscriber base of  more than twice this level, Stan is well positioned to play a part in  the evolution of SVOD in Australia.  20 Nine Entertainment Co. 20 Nine Entertainment Co.  ===== PAGE 23 ===== Beloved Stan  Original Bump,  returned to Stan  in 2023 for its  third season.

Nine’s Publishing division includes the mastheads The Sydney  Morning Herald, The Age, The Australian Financial Review,  The Brisbane Times and WAtoday, as well as Nine’s other Digital  Publishing titles including Pedestrian, Drive and nine.com.au.  During 2023, in a more difficult economic and advertising market,  the quality, diversity and veracity of Nine’s content underpinned  continued growth in reader revenue (subscription, licensing  and circulation) which now accounts for more than half of total  revenue. This longer-term reweighting has been the result of  Nine’s clear commitment to audiences, and the content that  drives engagement and, ultimately, subscription. As in Television and Radio, Nine Publishing is focused on  extending audiences of its content across existing and emerging  digital platforms, and is the most progressed of the Nine assets  on that journey. In FY23, more than 60% of revenues were  digitally-sourced, up from less than 50% in 2019.  IN FY23, NINE  PUBLISHING REPORTED  EBITDA OF $165M  (-8%) ON REVENUE  OF $575M (-3%).

In FY23, digital subscription and  licensing revenue grew by 5%, more than offsetting the decline  in print. This strong performance in digital enabled Nine to  increase digital subscription rates, for the first time since digital  packages began, boosting ARPU, and with a minimal impact  on churn. Nine’s pool of around 1.3 million incremental registered users  has provided Nine with valuable data on consumption and  engagement, enabling targeting of advertising to more of the  Group’s 16 million monthly readership base.  During the year, Nine continued to receive licensing revenues  from the key digital platforms, in recognition of the quality of the  Group’s journalism and the contribution Nine’s content makes  to the business models of these platforms. As distribution paths  continue to proliferate, Nine remains focused on monetising its  content across all available platforms – crucial in ensuring the  long-term vibrancy and uniqueness of the Group’s premium  journalism. The growth of TikTok and surge of AI (artificial  intelligence) platforms such as ChatGPT creates incremental  opportunities for Nine to continue to build its licensing revenues. After a strong start to the year, Nine Publishing was impacted  by the softer advertising market through the second half of  FY23. Digital advertising revenue declined by 14% across the  year, primarily reflecting softness in programmatic advertising.  Print advertising was broadly flat across the year – first half  growth being followed by a markedly softer second half. Growth in audiences, and utilisation of Nine’s Group-wide data  will provide further opportunities to continue to grow our share  of the $1.5 billion addressable digital advertising market. In FY23,  Nine Publishing continued to grow share in a market which  was impacted by the underlying economic conditions.

This judgement was vindication for Nine’s  investigative journalists Nick McKenzie and Chris Masters who  began reporting on this difficult and complicated story more  than seven years ago. It was a vindication for the many people  in Nine’s newsrooms and organisation who support this public  interest journalism. It is also a vindication for the brave soldiers  of the Australian Defence Force’s SAS who served their country  with distinction and then had the courage to speak the truth  about what happened in Afghanistan. Publishing a story of this magnitude is never easy, but  high quality investigative journalism is vital to a thriving  democracy. Nine’s unequivocal backing of this story and the  associated defence (and now the appeal brought about by  Mr Roberts‑Smith) is a clear demonstration of Nine’s commitment  to quality journalism. 1.

New product launches in FY23 During 2023, without the impact of pandemic news consumption,  readers increasingly turned to lifestyle and sport content.  In keeping with this theme, Nine invested in two key categories –   where it already had a presence, but which the Group believed  could become more significant subscriber and advertising  drivers in the medium term. These products also offer advertisers  a differentiated opportunity to access engaged and highly  relevent audiences. In March, Nine re-launched its Good Food product, Australia’s  trusted food media brand, across both digital and print.  With a monthly cross-platform readership of 1.5 million1 and a  social media presence of nearly 700,000 people, the relaunched  goodfood.com.au is now fully integrated into the Sydney Morning  Herald, The Age, Brisbane Times and WAtoday websites,  with new tech and product features; a revamped navigation  of localised restaurant reviews; regular columns from some of  food’s biggest names, and new editorial features including more  cooking tips, eating out guides and trends coverage. Enhanced  content from some of the biggest names in Australian food is  complemented by state-of-the-art technology features improving  navigation and ultimately engagement.  The annual Good Food Awards are the home of Australia’s most- recognised and respected restaurant awards – the coveted  chef’s hats have been given out for more than 40 years – making  Good Food a cross-platform brand like no other spanning print,  digital, television, events and retail.

Drive’s motoring experts review and drive every  car available for Australians to buy and provide expert advice,  opinion, new car showrooms, Drive Car of the Year awards and  extensive listings of dealer accredited cars for sale. Pedestrian Nine also owns 100% of Pedestrian Group, one of Australia’s  leading youth media groups. With a monthly audience of  3.5 million young Australians3 on its websites (a notoriously  hard to reach demographic), Pedestrian Group breaks the  stories that matter to those readers, from culture to tech,  business to gaming, fashion to entertainment and politics to  lifestyle through its diverse brand portfolio across pedestrian.tv,  VICE, Refinery 29, Gizmodo, Kotaku and Lifehacker. It is also  home to Open Air Cinemas.  Advertising constituted around 85% of total gross revenues  in FY23, as the Group continued to extend its monetisation of  audiences through affiliate and commerce revenues as well as  continued engagement on Pedestrian Jobs, a jobs board for  young Aussies in the creative and media industries.  The Group also expanded its operations into New Zealand, led  by VICE AU’s work with the Ministry of Social Development to  launch their multi-year Love Better initiative.  14 time Walkley-award  winning investigative  journalist, Nick McKenzie. Annual Report 2023 25 Annual Report 2023 25 Overview Corporate Governance Directors’ Report Operating and Financial Review Financial Statements Shareholder Information Corporate Directory  ===== PAGE 28 ===== Nine holds a 60% stake in the separately listed Domain Group  (ASX: DHG), one of Australia’s leading property technology and  services businesses. Domain’s integrated suite of assets offers  both consumers and agents a cohesive and integrated suite of  property-related services including core listings, agent solutions,  consumer solutions and property data solutions. Nine’s relationship with Domain extends beyond this equity  stake. Editorial content, support of Domain brand through Nine’s  news and shows like The Block as well as the bringing together  and utilisation of the Groups’ extensive first party data-bases are  key examples of mutually beneficial co-operation between Nine  and Domain.  In FY23, Domain’s result reflected the challenging property  environment, particularly in its core markets of Sydney and  Melbourne. Domain’s Residential revenues, 63% of the total,  fell by 7%, with 8% growth in controllable yield, a function of  both price and depth penetration, more than offset by the  weaker listing market, and Domain’s geographic mix. This yield  performance was supported by Domain’s new product launches  during the year including the Social Boost All tier early in FY23.  These initiatives continue the Group’s focus on increasing the  value Domain provides to agents and consumers, consistent with  the Marketplaces model. Media, Developers and Commercial recorded a slight decline  in revenues to 13% of the Group total. Commercial Real Estate  (CRE), which provides subscription, depth listing and advertising  for the office, industrial and retail sector, was the best performing  business, with revenue growth of 6%. Conversely, Media had  a more difficult period, in line with both the property cycle and  broader advertising market. Domain’s Agent Solutions business is focused on providing  agents with enhanced tools and solutions to enable them to  strengthen and grow their businesses. In FY23, revenue grew  by a reported 86% (6% underlying), boosted by a full year  contribution from Realbase. Realbase is the leading campaign  management platform in Australia and New Zealand with its initial  contribution impacted by the weaker listing environment. Real  Time Agent provides enhanced digital tools for the property  transaction process while Pricefinder delivers property data,  insights and reporting tools and Homepass provides database  tools to support the open for inspection process.  Domain Insight recorded revenue growth of 16% (4% underlying),  which includes the performance of Pricefinder (non-Agent),  Australian Property Monitors and a full year of Insight Data  Solutions (IDS), which provides land and property valuation data  to Government and corporate customers. Domain Insight is  focused on building Australia’s best quality data asset, available  to all customers, by combining all of Domain’s data sources.  IN FY23, DOMAIN  REPORTED EBITDA  OF $103M ($109M1)  ON REVENUES OF  $355M ($346M1)  FOR THE YEAR. DOMAIN 1.	 As reported by Domain Group (ASX: DHG), excludes discontinued  businesses (Domain Home Loans). 26 Nine Entertainment Co.  ===== PAGE 29 ===== While announcing its decision to exit its current Domain Home  Loans joint venture, Domain remains confident about the future  role that home loans can play in driving the Marketplace strategy.  Domain services print audiences with property listings and  editorial through the Domain, Domain Prestige, Allhomes and  Domain Review magazines. Domain and Domain Prestige are  distributed through Nine’s leading publications – The Sydney  Morning Herald, The Age and The Australian Financial Review.  Domain’s print revenues declined by 24% to $17 million,  reflecting the underlying listing market weakness, particularly in  Domain’s key markets of Melbourne and Sydney. Print continues  to deliver strategic value to Domain, from both an agent and  consumer perspective.  Across the year, as the listings market weakened, Domain  responded to the changing market conditions with second  half costs down 18% on first half, which resulted in a full year  underlying cost increase of 7%1 – slightly bettering guidance  provided to the market during the year. Fourth quarter initiatives  included proactive annual leave management, staff recruitment  phasing and further discretionary cost controls. Across its Marketplace ecosystem, Domain’s unique digital  audience of 8.3 million2 supports the Group’s extensive data and  related infrastructure, enabling greater utilisation and insights  for Domain’s customers. During the year, Domain continued its  commitment to the three key areas of Platforms, Personalisation  and Privacy which together contribute to Domain’s data quality,  user experience and ability to monetise its solutions across its  entire marketplace.  1.

Community We will create opportunities  for all Australians to feel they  belong here Company We want everyone to know they  have the opportunity to join the  Nine community Climate We are focused on developing the tools  and framework to give us the ability to  fully measure our corporate greenhouse  gas footprint across the business Company – People and Culture  This year was a year of reset for our people – of resetting what it  means to be part of Nine, resetting our purpose and our values,  resetting connection with our audiences, resetting how we  work and resetting our commitments. Together with our people,  we co-created our Purpose – Australia Belongs Here – and  our Values – Walk the Talk, Turn Over Every Stone and Keep it  Human. Our Purpose and Values always existed – they are the  behaviours our people use to display their passion for Nine –  but co-creating and articulating the Purpose and Values helps  to unify our people, and align our expectations of behaviour  at Nine. It’s this purpose and values that now underpin all that  we do at Nine, the way we make decisions, how we show  up. And the People and Culture strategy is anchored on the  Purpose, delivering in Purpose and Values, Talent, Leadership  and Inclusion, Learning and Development, and Health, Safety  and Wellbeing. Delivering on Purpose and Values In FY22, we began a process to hear from people from all parts  of our business, right around the country. More than 1,000 people  engaged in digital sessions and interactive workshops to debate  what unites us. These workshops created conversation about values and  behaviours, identifying what was important to us. We heard that  empathy, humility, courage, credibility, curiosity and innovation  mattered most. Despite being a large, diverse organisation,  we found that consistent themes came up time and time again.  Our shared purpose was already there, driving our passion and  belief in what we do. It was a part of our DNA; who we all are  at Nine, and why we can consistently deliver success for our  audiences, the wider community and our shareholders. Delivering on Leadership With the launch of our Purpose and Values, changing market  conditions and the increased opportunity of our Olympic Games  deals, our leaders are critical to supporting our people to be the  best they can be and deliver our long-term strategy.  Over FY23, we continued to support our leaders, launching our  first Group-wide leadership conference. 230 senior leaders from  across all areas of Nine came together to connect, exchange  ideas and align on the future direction of our business.  With the launch of our Purpose and Values, resources and  workshops were also created for our leaders to help them lead  with purpose and bring our values to life within their teams.  To continue to further ensure we have the leadership capability  we need for our future, we have also defined what it means to  lead at Nine and identified the core capabilities our leaders need.  In FY24, we will launch a new Leadership Portal with resources  for our leaders; as well as a leadership program, Leading@Nine.  All leaders will go through this program over the course of two  years, ensuring they have the skills required to lead and support  our people to be the best they can be.  Delivering on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Following our review in FY21, and partnership with leading  consultancy Diversity Partners, a new team was created within  People & Culture to further the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion  agenda Group-wide. This team has now been in place for close  to 12 months, and over this time we have launched a number  of planned activities and initiatives, both to the business and  behind the scenes. During FY23, we created and launched Employee Resource  Groups (ERGs) across multiple diverse lenses, spanning the  breadth of the Nine Group. Each with a dedicated Executive  Sponsor and co-chairs, Nine Communities exist to provide  support for people with lived experience, encouraging them to  come together as a group to raise awareness and champion  change within our organisation. Nine Communities (Gender  Equity, Cultural Diversity, Pride, All Abilities and First Nations)  have come together and rallied around causes and issues alike,  launching internally through events such as Lunar New Year  events, International Womens’ Day and World Pride celebrations.  28 Nine Entertainment Co. 28 Nine Entertainment Co.  ===== PAGE 31 ===== As at 30 June 2023. In particular, we have convened an Employee Resource Group  consisting of employees with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  backgrounds. This group of employees meet regularly, and are  advising Nine on approaches to our First Nations Strategy, areas  of importance and future focus for the organisation.  In FY23, we again celebrated our First Nations employees and  the wider community with the launch of Cultural Competency  training modules, available Group-wide, delivered online by  Arrilla and Shelley Reyes AO. We also placed Acknowledgement  of Country plaques across all of our offices nationwide,  referencing the specific lands of each of our locations.  While in its early stages, we see the future of this group as one  of our key advisory lenses, coupled with external expertise in  relevant areas. The success of our efforts in Diversity, Equity and Inclusion would  not be possible without the shared knowledge of our peers and  partners. In FY23, Nine solidified relationships with peak industry  bodies, including our membership investment in Media Diversity  Australia, while also embarking on new partnerships across  multiple lenses. The Australian Network on Disability, Pride in  Diversity, and the Diversity Council of Australia are now strategic  partners and assisting us with resources, training and advisory  on our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion journey. Details on our objectives for gender diversity can be found in the  Corporate Governance Statement on page 38. Risk and Compliance/Respect at Work With the recent legislation changes and upcoming mandates  we are working towards full compliance by executing a deep  dive into the experiences of our people across Nine. We have  engaged and are working with Intersection at Work, a leading  consultancy whose members were involved in crafting the  legislation itself, to assist us in uncovering any areas of concern  and updating our policies, processes and employee experiences  to not only meet requirements but also provide support and  guiderails into the future. We expect to see this work complete by  the end of the calendar year. Delivering Engagement Results from the annual Nine Employee Engagement Survey in  2022 told us that whilst our people feel connected to their team  and the brand or product their role relates to, they wanted to  learn more and get closer to the broader Group and its many  different products and brands.  A new concept initiative called ‘Employee Exclusives’ was  developed to provide unique value around our incredible content  that only employees at Nine can experience. The initiative  includes an annual calendar of unique events, behind-the- scenes access, and special perks related to our products such  as competitions, prizes, exclusive stories, merchandise, discounts  and more.  Delivering our Value Proposition The need for Nine to identify, develop and retain the best talent  in the market has never been stronger. This is impacted by many  factors, including the current employment market, and changes  in employee expectations about the working environment and  corporate citizenship, particularly around responsibility, ESG  and inclusion. In FY23, we undertook research and qualified our available data  to get an insight into both the internal and external perceptions  of our employer brand. Utilising these and other inputs, including  our work on Purpose and Values and linked to the Group  strategy and goals, we have worked with our employees, tested  assumptions and then crafted our Group-wide Employer Value  Proposition. As a result, we have developed a visual identity  and narrative that we can take to market, articulating the true  experience of working at Nine. Delivering on Health and Wellbeing Psychosocial Safety With the regulatory changes across Australia pertaining to the  management of psychosocial safety in the workplace, Nine  continues to review its operation in light of the new obligations.  In particular, Nine has continued to deliver on training and  reviewed the strategy for FY24, which will have clear governance  around the strategic pillars of Protect, Promote and Respond and  programs of work behind each element.

To supplement knowledge at a leadership level, Nine has  continued to roll out the Thrive Ambassador program, which  is a peer-support mental health program. This is supported by  an external provider, who provides suitable supervision and  instruction to Thrive Ambassadors. Nine will continue to deploy  this program throughout FY24. FY23 has seen an increased uptake of Converge, our Employee  Assistance Program (EAP) partner. This has been seen as a direct  result of the education provided to leaders and employees, and  an understanding of the proactive support available to Nine’s  employees and their families. Nine’s safety team curate a monthly  publication which is generated from Converge; and ‘Thrive at  Nine’ is a digital magazine shared across the Nine Group, and  is widely read by our people. To safeguard Nine’s Safety team from psychosocial harm,  we have implemented a ‘Care for the Carer’ program so that  the members of this team can appropriately receive suitable  professional assistance as required. Given the nature of  conversations and matters the safety team are involved in, the  psychological support required is more tailored and specialised  than EAP and allows team members to build trust and rapport  with a clinician for ongoing care and supervision. This program  was nominated in the ARPA NSW industry awards and was a  finalist for ‘Outstanding Achievement in Return to Work Award –  ARPA Associate Members and Industry Stakeholders’. Building on the Respect@Work legislation changes, Nine has  co-designed a capability module with external psychologists  for Nine’s leaders, initially being deployed in our Publishing  division. The identified risk in this business unit is exposure of  journalists to disrespectful behaviour from external stakeholders,  that ranges from incivility to overt discriminatory behaviour or  commentary, and online violence. Female journalists have been  identified as being at a greater risk of exposure to these types  of behaviour, including sexualised discrimination. This module is  designed to upskill leadership in how to respond to employees  who have been exposed to these behaviours, and how to refer  them to support. This training will continue into FY24 and be  shared with all news gathering departments. Fatigue study Nine is engaged in a broad range of activities to collect and  gather content from across the business in relation to the  management of fatigue across the Group. In FY23, we have  undertaken a study of our people to listen to them and gain their  perspectives, insights and thoughts on the work they undertake  and the risks and opportunities associated with fatigue.  This research demonstrated the need for further fatigue planning  and processes; and in FY24, Nine will focus on development  of a fatigue risk management system and practical tools for our  people to use to assess and manage fatigue. Manual Handling Project At Nine, the primary workplace-related injuries are  musculoskeletal injuries; and slips, trips and falls. To gather more  insight into this, we continued to invest in onsite physiotherapists  at our main broadcast centre in Sydney, and provide treatment  and education to those involved in physical roles associated with  news gathering including camera operators, photographers etc.  There is high engagement and participation with this program and  we aim to broaden this across the Nine operating group in FY24.  In addition to this, a review of equipment was undertaken to  understand the physical demands placed on these higher risk  employees. Recommendations have been made and initial  implementation of carrying aids to reduce the physical load on  employees is expected across the country in FY24. Injury Management and Workers Compensation  Nine continues to invest in support for injured workers and has  achieved good pre-injury outcomes for our people this year.  This has resulted in a stable premium result, below the industry  average. We are pleased to see the increase in reported hazards  back to pre-COVID levels (acknowledging the reduction in FY22  primarily due to the prevalence of working from home in that year).

The Charters which Nine has adopted and related corporate  governance policies are available on Nine’s website  (https://www.nineforbrands.com.au/corporate-governance-2/). Consumer Data and Privacy Nine collects consumer data and information through the Group’s  base of more than 20 million unique, registered users. Nine  recognises that it is critically important to have controls and  frameworks in place to protect consumers’ data and privacy.  Without appropriate controls, the business risks losing public  faith, social licence to operate and shareholder value.  Collection and usage of this data is governed by the Australian  Privacy Principles (APPs) and Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (Privacy  Act) and Nine’s privacy policy. Nine has recently engaged an  independent third party to review Nine’s policy and procedures  for data governance, which recommended a number of data  management practices that Nine is looking to implement in the  short term. Nine is also engaging with the Government through  the current Privacy Act reform proposals, to seek to ensure a fair  balance between protecting the rights of individuals and ensuring  an effective free press. Details on Nine’s security and privacy policy can be found at  https://login.nine.au/privacy. Facilitating trusted journalism As a public facing media outlet, it is important that Nine promotes  independent journalism. There are, in place, governance  frameworks that ensure truthfulness, accuracy, objectivity and  independence of editorial decision making, from commercial  decision making. These are underpinned by the external  frameworks which apply to journalism activities, specifically: •	 For online and print journalism, Nine is committed to  complying with the various standards developed by the  Australian Press Council in conjunction with its constituent  members (https://www.presscouncil.org.au/statements-of- principles). This includes a Statement of General Principles, a  Statement of Privacy Principles, Specific Principles covering  matters such as the reporting of suicides, and Advisory  Guidelines on matters such as reporting elections. As a  member of the Press Council, Nine must cooperate with  the Press Council’s consideration of complaints against it  and publish any decisions by the Press Council following a  complaint to Nine. •	 Television broadcast journalism, including the handling  of personal information, is governed by the Commercial  Television Code of Practice (https://www.freetv.com/resources/ code-of-practice) and the ACMA Privacy Guidelines (https:// acma.gov.au/publications/2016-09/guide/privacy-guidelines- broadcasters). The Commercial Television Code of Practice  prohibits certain types of programs and advertisements,  requires classification of program material and broadcasts  in suitable time slots, and puts limits on the amount of  advertising and other non-programming matter which can be  broadcast. It also promotes editorial accuracy, fairness and  protection of privacy for individuals in relation to news and  current affairs. The Commercial Television Code of Practice also requires  Nine to ensure advertisers comply with the AANA Advertiser  Code of Ethics and the AANA Code of Advertising and  Marketing Communications to Children.  Further, Nine’s commercial television licences, issued under  the Broadcasting Services Act, are subject to conditions  around specific matters such as advertising of tobacco and  interactive gambling, obligations to broadcast matters of  national interest, and prohibitions on the broadcast of material  with certain classifications.  •	 For Radio journalism, Nine complies with the  standards developed by Commercial Radio & Audio  (https:///www.commercialradio.com.au/legal/regulation-codes).  In respect of its Radio business, Nine is bound by the  Commercial Radio Code of Practice and the Commercial  Radio Guidelines which also promote editorial accuracy and  guide reporting on sensitive topics such as mental illness.  As in television, Nine’s commercial radio licences, issued  under the Broadcasting Services Act, are subject to conditions  around specific matters such as advertising of tobacco and  interactive gambling, obligations to broadcast matters of  national interest, and prohibitions on the broadcast of material  with certain classifications.

Nine Cares also delivers indirectly within the Company pillar,  ensuring our people have the opportunity and encouragement  from Nine to support our charity partners and to give back to the  community in a number of ways. Each employee receives two  extra days annual leave to volunteer and anyone volunteering  on a weekend day receives a day in lieu. The uptake amongst  our people has been exceptional and the ease with which Nine  helps them to navigate volunteering outside work hours has  been appreciated. We know that to both attract and retain top  talent, it is essential we continue to give employees a range  of opportunities to engage and contribute to the stories and  journeys of Australians in need. Our charity partners produce impact reports as a requirement  of our relationship, which is reviewed on an ongoing basis by  People and Culture to ensure good governance.

Climate – Environmental Measurement  and Reporting In January 2023, Nine appointed internationally recognised  environmental specialists South Pole, to support us in GHG  accounting and goal setting across the Group. Relative to similar  media corporations globally, we anticipate our Scope 1+2 not  to exceed 5% of our GHG emissions; the remainder being  our supply chain relationships in Scope 3. On completion this  calendar year, Nine will be able to consider whether it is able  to set science-based targets, report to stakeholders, and adopt  a Net Zero roadmap. Nine has joined Sustainable Screens Australia as a foundation  member to support the establishment of albert in Australia.  Founded in 2011 in the UK, albert is a BAFTA-owned industry  backed organisation that supports the film and television industry  to reduce the environmental impact of its productions. Nine provides senior Sustainability representation across  the industry (IAB, AANA, CRA, SSA) and regularly reviews  industry initiatives. Our mastheads continue to drive agenda  setting sustainability conversations. This year’s Australian  Financial Review ESG Summit was a sell-out and our Sydney  Morning Herald Sustainability Summit continues to educate  and inform the industry.

The  Board ensures that this team is appropriately qualified and experienced to discharge its responsibilities and has in place procedures  to assess the performance of the senior management team. During the year, the delegation of authority across the Group was  reviewed and updated.  The Chief Executive Officer’s role includes: i.	 responsibility for the effective leadership of the management team;  ii.	 the development of strategic objectives for the business; and  iii.	 the day-to-day management of Nine’s operations. The Chief Executive Officer may delegate aspects of his authority and power but remains accountable to the Board for Nine’s  performance and is required to report regularly to the Board on the conduct and performance of Nine’s business units.  1.3 Board composition  The Board consisted of a majority of independent Directors during the Reporting Period.  At all times during the Reporting Period, the Chairman was an independent Director and not the same person as the Chief Executive  Officer.  During the Reporting Period, the Board and its committees consisted of the following individuals:  Name Tenure  Independent Committee membership Peter Costello From 6 February 2013 Yes Member of the Audit & Risk Management Committee  Michael Sneesby From 1 April 2021 No None Nicholas Falloon  From 7 December 2018   to 9 November 2022 Yes Member of the People & Remuneration Committee till 9 November 2022 Andrew Lancaster From 1 April 2021 No Member of the People & Remuneration Committee (from 9 November 2022) Samantha Lewis From 20 March 2017 Yes Chair of the Audit & Risk Management Committee  Member of the People & Remuneration Committee  Mickie Rosen From 7 December 2018 Yes  None  Catherine West From 9 May 2016 Yes Member of the Audit & Risk Management Committee  Chair of the People & Remuneration Committee  Mr Falloon resigned as a director during the financial year. Since the end of the financial year, the Board has appointed Mandy  Pattinson as an additional independent non-executive director.  Details of Directors’ skills, experience and expertise and their attendances at Board and Committee meetings are contained in the  Annual Report. The Board has considered whether the Chairman remains independent, given he has been a director for over 10 years,  and has confirmed that he is still properly considered an independent director, as he brings independent judgement to matters before  the Board.  1.4 Company Secretary  The Board appoints and removes the Company Secretary. All Directors have direct access to the Company Secretary who supports  the effectiveness of the Board by monitoring that Board policy and procedures are followed, and co-ordinates the completion and  despatch of Board agendas and papers.

Those  processes are described in this section and section 2.3.  The process for nomination of new Directors is managed by the Board, under the leadership of the Chairman.  Where a casual vacancy is to be filled, the Board typically considers the skills and expertise which it would be beneficial to add to  the Board, then identifies suitable candidates (using an external search adviser if necessary). A review process is carried out by the  Chairman, before a candidate is proposed to the whole Board for approval.  When Directors are proposed to shareholders for election or re-election, detailed information about the Director, their professional  background and areas of expertise are provided to shareholders, so that the shareholders have all material information relevant to a  decision whether or not to elect or re-elect that Director.  All Directors are issued with a letter of appointment that sets out the key terms of their appointment and the Company’s expectations  regarding involvement with Nine. Nine provides briefings to new Directors on its business and strategy and the Directors’ roles and  responsibilities and access to previous board papers, as part of the induction. Directors may meet with the Company’s auditors to  receive a detailed briefing on Nine’s financial reporting and audit issues.  All Directors are expected and encouraged to engage in professional development activities to develop and maintain the skills and  knowledge needed to perform their roles as Directors. In addition, ongoing engagement with senior management across the business  provides the Directors with development of their knowledge of industry issues. Directors may obtain independent professional advice at Nine’s expense on matters arising in the course of their Board and committee  duties, after obtaining the Chairman’s approval. The other Directors must be advised if the Chairman’s approval is withheld. 2.2 Remuneration  The Remuneration Report sets out Nine’s policies and practices regarding the remuneration of non-executive Directors, executive  Directors and other senior management of the group. It also provides details of the remuneration paid to Directors and certain other  senior management of Nine in the Reporting Period.  Nine has a written employment agreement with each senior executive, setting out the terms on which she or he is engaged by the  Company, including the components of fixed and variable or at risk remuneration payable to the senior executive.  40 Nine Entertainment Co. 40 Nine Entertainment Co.  ===== PAGE 43 ===== 2.3 Board skills matrix The Board has adopted a skills matrix which is used, together with a consideration of the diversity present among the Board, in  assessing the composition of the Board from time to time. During the Reporting Period, the Board reviewed the skills matrix and  confirmed it remains appropriate. The skills identified are: Media Industry  Working in or with the media industry in a significant capacity Content  Working in or with businesses that acquire, create or exploit content Digital/New Media Working in or with digital/online businesses and emerging forms of media and technology Direct to consumer Working in or with businesses that are consumer facing General business expertise Gained in a substantial business, as a senior executive or director  Strategy  Developing and implementing the strategic direction of an organisation Managing Risk Developing, implementing and overseeing risk management policies and procedures for a substantial organisation Managing People & Change Expertise in human resource management, particularly through periods of change in a business or industry  Political/regulatory Managing and influencing the political and regulatory environment Mergers & Acquisitions Expertise in undertaking corporate mergers or acquisitions activities Financial Markets Expertise in debt and capital markets  ASX Governance Knowledge of the corporate governance and regulatory framework that applies to an ASX listed company  Legal  Experience practising as a lawyer in a relevant field or exposure to legal issues relevant to Nine’s business Tax/Financial Expertise in overseeing or managing the tax and financial affairs of a substantial Australian business The Board considers that the current members, taken as a whole, satisfy the mix of skills identified in the skills matrix, as a majority of  Directors have a high level of expertise across each of the skills identified in the skills matrix. The Board also demonstrates diversity in  terms of gender and international work experience.  The chart below shows the degree to which Board members, considered as a group, demonstrate a high level of the skills which form  part of Nine’s skills matrix (with a score of 100% indicating that all Directors have the skill to a high degree).

Nine is  committed to the identification, monitoring and management of key risks, to protect and enhance shareholder interests. Responsibility for risk management is shared across the organisation: i.	 The Board is responsible for approving Nine’s Risk Management Policy and for determining Nine’s approach to risk, taking into  account Nine’s strategic objectives and other factors including stakeholder expectations. ii.	 The Board has delegated to the Audit & Risk Management Committee responsibility for:  a.	 identifying major risk areas;  b.	 periodically reviewing, monitoring and approving Nine’s risk management framework, policies, procedures and systems to  provide assurance that major business risks are identified, consistently assessed and appropriately addressed;  c.	 ensuring that risk considerations are incorporated into strategic and business planning;  d.	 providing risk management updates to the Board and any supplementary information required to provide the Board with  confidence that key risks are being appropriately managed and making recommendations on changes to Nine’s risk  management framework; e.	 reviewing reports from management concerning compliance with key laws, regulations, licences and standards which Nine is  required to satisfy in order to operate;  f.	 overseeing the effectiveness of Nine’s financial controls and systems; g.	 overseeing tax compliance and tax risk management;  h.	 reviewing any significant findings of any examinations by regulatory agencies;  i.	 reviewing any material incident involving a fraud or a breakdown of Nine’s risk controls; and j.	 evaluating the structure and adequacy of the Group’s insurance coverage.  iii.	 Nine management is responsible for establishing operational processes and policies to support Nine’s risk management framework,  including identifying major risk areas and effectively identifying, monitoring, reporting on and managing key business risks.  iv.	 Each employee and contractor is expected to understand and manage the risks within their responsibility and boundaries of  authority, as set out in Nine’s internal policies, when making decisions and undertaking day-to-day activities. Nine has processes in place to identify and assess key risks, whether at an enterprise level or a project level, and to manage those  risks. Nine’s Risk and Assurance function, with oversight from the Audit & Risk Management Committee, implements a continuous  process of communication with internal stakeholders to understand and influence the risk environment affecting Nine. It also conducts  annual examinations of Nine’s external and internal environments, to establish the parameters within which risks must be managed.  Key business risks are discussed below and are further outlined in the Operating and Financial Review section of the Annual Report.  Nine’s internal processes for risk management include establishing operating plans and budgets, periodic reforecasting and  monitoring of progress against the approved plans and budgets. There are controls in place in relation to matters such as approval  of payments and approval of contracts, which are designed to ensure that levels of delegated authority are adhered to. Staff and  business units have both financial and non-financial KPIs, which are monitored.  Nine has a thorough system for managing workplace safety, including regular reviews of policies and standard operating procedures,  training for staff, consultation with staff through WHS committees at each site and regular site inspections to identify any changes in risks.  During the Reporting Period, Nine, including through the Audit & Risk Management Committee, continued to review its risk  management framework, including re-assessing the major risk areas for the business. Through these activities, the Audit & Risk  Management Committee has reviewed Nine’s risk management framework and satisfied itself that it continues to be sound and that  Nine is operating with due regard to an appropriate risk appetite. 4.2 Internal Audit Responsibility for internal audit is part of the broader Risk and Assurance function, managed by the Director of Risk, who reports on  internal audit activities at each meeting of the Audit & Risk Management Committee.  The internal audit function’s goal is to bring a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluating and improving the effectiveness of risk  management, control and governance over business processes, through independent, objective assurance. The internal audit plan is agreed with the Audit & Risk Management Committee annually, however is able to be adapted as the need  arises following consultation with the Committee. During the year, Nine conducted a number of reviews in the internal audit plan, using  an external service provider to provide specialist skills and capacity.

Any exposures or breaches of key policies or incidence of risks, where  significant, must be reported to the Audit & Risk Management Committee and the Board. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required to provide to the Board declarations in accordance with  section 295A of the Corporations Act which confirm:  i.	 that the financial records of Nine have been properly maintained and that the financial statements comply with the appropriate  accounting standards and give a true and fair view of Nine’s financial position and performance;  ii.	 their view that the Company’s financial reporting is founded on the basis of a sound system of risk management and internal  compliance and control which implements the financial policies adopted by the Board; and iii.	 that the Company’s risk management and internal compliance and control system is operating effectively in all material respects. These declarations were provided before the half year accounts to 31 December 2022 and the full year accounts to 30 June 2023  were approved by the Board.  4.4 Verification of the integrity of unaudited corporate reports Nine periodically releases reports which have not been audited or reviewed by the auditors, such as the Directors’ Report and  operating review which accompanies the financial statements, this Corporate Governance Statement and other elements of the  Annual Report.  Nine has a process to ensure that those reports are complete and accurate before they are released, which includes: •	 Preparation of drafts by experienced staff of Nine, who consult with relevant colleagues to ensure information is collected from  necessary departments within Nine and consult with advisers as required; •	 Review of the drafts by relevant stakeholders who will have knowledge of the matters covered in the report, which may include  the General Counsel, Head of Investor Relations, Chief Financial & Strategy Officer, Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Group Financial  Controller and Director of Risk; and •	 Where necessary or appropriate, approval by the Board or by the Company’s Disclosure Committee (which consists of the Chief  Executive Officer, General Counsel & Company Secretary and Chief Financial & Strategy Officer).  4.5 Material exposure to risks  Nine has exposure to specific risks that could impact on its ability to create value for its shareholders, including (in no particular order):  •	 Ransomware and other destructive cyber activity; •	 Managing the transition to digital and new markets; •	 Changes in industry structure and the competitive environment; •	 Breach of data/privacy laws; •	 Execution of Nine’s digital strategy, including delivery of platform development; •	 Impact of regulatory changes; •	 Mental health and wellbeing of staff;  •	 Attraction and retention of talent; and •	 Operational disruption due to technology failures.  Further discussion regarding the key risks affecting Nine’s business and the way in which Nine manages those risks is outlined in the  Operating and Financial Review in Nine’s Annual Report.  44 Nine Entertainment Co. 44 Nine Entertainment Co.  ===== PAGE 47 ===== Nine has adopted an Environmental, Social and Governance Policy. Nine’s initial priorities in this regard are in the areas of:  •	 Facilitating independent journalism  •	 Consumer data security and privacy •	 Community engagement and contribution  •	 Carbon footprint accounting  •	 Diversity and inclusion •	 ESG disclosure and transparency Nine does not have material exposure to environmental risks, given the nature of Nine’s business. However, Nine understands that  its impact on the environment is an important matter requiring increased attention and reporting. Nine has previously committed to  expanding the tracking and reporting of its carbon footprint, to support the identification of opportunities for Nine to do more to reduce  its environmental impact and its carbon emissions. To support this, in January 2023, Nine appointed environmental specialists South  Pole, to support Nine in GHG accounting and goal setting. Consistent with similar media corporations globally, Nine anticipates its  Scope 1+2 emissions will be less than 5% of total GHG emissions, the remainder being from supply chain relationships in Scope 3. On  completion of that exercise in the 2023 calendar year, Nine will be able to consider whether it is able to set science-based targets,  report to stakeholders, and adopt a Net Zero roadmap.  Nine has joined Sustainable Screens Australia as a foundation member, to support the establishment of the albert initiative in Australia.  Founded in 2011 in the UK, albert is a BAFTA-owned, industry backed organisation that supports the film and television industry to  reduce the environmental impact of its productions.  Nine provides senior Sustainability representation across the industry (via IAB, AANA and Sustainable Screens Australia) and regularly  reviews industry initiatives. Nine’s mastheads drive agenda-setting sustainability conversations, including the Australian Financial  Review ESG Summit and the Sydney Morning Herald Sustainability Summit.  Nine understands that, as a media company, it has a role to play in supporting the community and upholding high standards in relation  to its content. Nine undertakes a number of activities, including those described below, to engender trust and confidence in Nine. This  is necessary for its continued social licence to operate and to mitigate social risks relating to Nine’s operations.  Nine’s activities as a broadcaster and publisher are managed in compliance with the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth), Commercial  Television Code of Practice, Commercial Radio Code of Practice, the Press Council’s Statement of General Principles and other  regulatory obligations which affect the material which Nine can broadcast and publish, and the manner in which Nine conducts  operations. These set minimum standards for Nine’s content and provide its stakeholders with assurance about Nine as a trusted  source of news and entertainment.  There are a number of legislative reform projects being pursued which could impact on the way in which Nine carries out its business  activities, including its journalism. Nine contributes to these projects by making submissions, both directly and through industry bodies,  to ensure that the role of broadcasters, publishers and content creators is properly taken account of, when policies which impact on  their roles, such as the proposed reforms of the Privacy Act, are considered.  Nine has prepared its Modern Slavery Statement for the Reporting Period. In doing so, Nine has reviewed elements of its supply chain  to investigate whether Nine and its key suppliers are engaging in modern slavery practices. Nine’s Modern Slavery Statement provides  further details of its focus in this area. As part of its commitment to enhancing Diversity and Inclusion, during the last year Nine introduced Diversity, Equity and Inclusion  communities, built on Gender Equity, LGBTQIA+, Culture, Disability and First Nations. Each of these communities has an Executive  Sponsor and co-chairs drawn from across Nine. They provide support for people with lived experience, encouraging them to come  together as a group to raise awareness and champion change within its organisation. Nine takes its role as a community participant seriously, and undertakes a number of initiatives to support the communities we operate  in, including: •	 providing free airtime and advertising space to community service organisations and charities for community service  announcements; •	 actively supporting fundraising for a number of charities including the Sydney Children’s Hospital Gold Telethon and the Mark  Hughes Foundation Beanies for Brain Cancer fundraising drive; and •	 providing opportunities for staff to volunteer (through paid volunteer leave) both with the charities supported by Nine Cares,  including Adopt Change, St Vincent de Paul, and Two Good Co, and charities of the individual’s choosing.

Nine acknowledges the positive outcomes that can be achieved from a diverse workforce, and recognises the contribution of  diverse skills and talent from its Directors and employees. In the context of the policy, diversity includes gender, age, ethnicity, cultural  background, religion, sexual orientation, disability and mental impairment.  The Diversity Policy requires the Board to set and monitor on an annual basis Nine’s performance against measurable objectives in  relation to gender diversity, and other aspects of diversity.  5.2 Female representation  As at 30 June 2023, the proportion of men and women employed by Nine was as follows:  Women Men Board of Directors 50% 50% Senior Executives 36% 64% Total Nine workforce 45% 55% For this purpose, “Senior Executives” are the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Executive Officer’s direct reports.  5.3 Objectives for FY23 Nine’s performance against the objectives for achieving gender diversity which were adopted for the Reporting Period is as follows:  Objective Performance At least 30% of board positions to be  held by women and at least 30% of  such positions to be held by men This was satisfied.

At least 40% of senior executive  positions (CEO and direct reports) to  be held by women This was not satisfied. Following some changes in the CEO’s direct reports, five out of 14 (36%) of  these positions are held by women. However, women make up 47% (nine out of 19) of the Group  Leadership Team. Further, there are a number of women identified as potential successors for senior  executive roles within Nine.  At least 40% of management  positions to be held by women This was satisfied.

At Nine, we shape culture by sparking conversations, challenging perspectives, informing and entertaining our  communities. We bring people together by celebrating the big occasions and connecting the everyday moments.  Australia Belongs Here.  In conjunction with that purpose, Nine also developed and unveiled three values (www.nineforbrands.com.au/about/careers-at-nine/): •	 Walk The Talk •	 Turn Over Every Stone •	 Keep It Human Nine’s purpose is why we do what we do and is designed to guide decisions with a shared perspective, across all of Nine. The values  are “how we do it”. The values have been rolled out across Nine’s business, as each part of the business considers what those values  mean for how they work and the behaviours expected of all employees to demonstrate the values.  6.2 Code of Conduct Nine has a Code of Conduct which applies to all Directors and employees of Nine and its subsidiaries. The Code of Conduct:  •	 sets the ethical standards required in relation to conduct of Nine’s business; •	 provides clear guidance on Nine’s values and expectations of staff, in relation to matters such as protecting confidential information,  receipt of gifts, compliance with laws, protecting Company assets and outside interests of employees;  •	 prohibits giving or taking any bribes or improper payments in connection with doing business with Nine; and •	 offers guidance to shareholders and other stakeholders on its values, standards and expectations and what it means to work for or  with Nine.  Any material breaches of the Code of Conduct would be reported to the People & Remuneration Committee or, if any such breaches  involved fraud or other financial misconduct, would be reported to the Audit & Risk Management Committee. Nine is not aware of any  material breaches of the Code of Conduct during the Reporting Period.  6.3 Securities Trading Policy Nine’s Securities Trading Policy has been developed to educate the Board and employees of the Group about their obligations  under the Corporations Act in relation to trading in securities. The policy sets black  out periods in which shares cannot be traded by  Directors and employees to whom the policy applies. It requires those individuals to obtain consent before any trading outside a black   out period is undertaken.  The Securities Trading Policy prohibits employees from entering derivative or other transactions which limit economic risk in respect of  any Nine securities which are unvested or subject to a holding lock.  Nine is not aware of any breaches of the Securities Trading Policy during the Reporting Period.

Nine has a Disclosure Committee which is tasked with determining whether announcements on  potentially price sensitive matters are required, the content of announcements and ensuring that announcements are made within the  time frame required by the ASX Listing Rules.  Nine’s Disclosure Policy requires that any briefing and presentation materials containing previously undisclosed information will be  disclosed to the market through the ASX and Nine’s corporate website.  Nine is not aware of any breaches of the Disclosure Policy during the Reporting Period. Directors are on an email distribution list which ensures they receive copies of all material market announcements promptly after they  are released to the ASX.  Nine ensures that any new and substantive investor or analyst presentation, such as the Annual General Meeting presentation and  results presentations, is provided to the ASX Markets Announcement Platform before the presentation is provided to any third parties.  6.5 Shareholder Communications and participation Nine has a Shareholder Communications Policy which promotes effective two way communications with shareholders and other  stakeholders and encourages effective participation at Nine’s general meetings. Nine’s website (www.nineforbrands.com.au) provides  ready access for shareholders to key corporate governance documents, ASX releases, financial reports and other information of  relevance to shareholders. The website is updated as soon as possible after documents are released to the ASX under Nine’s  continuous disclosure obligations. The policy was complied with during the Reporting Period.  Nine and its share registry, Link Market Services, encourage shareholders to receive communications from Nine and its share registry  electronically. The websites of Nine and the registry both provide contact points for shareholders to communicate with Nine and the  registry electronically.  Nine provides a webcast/teleconference facility for its results announcements, so that all shareholders can attend the presentation  of the results, and its Annual General Meeting. In 2022, Nine held its AGM as a hybrid meeting, in preference to an in person only  meeting, to facilitate shareholder participation, and will do this again in 2023. In addition, Nine’s constitution allows direct voting, giving  shareholders a greater ability to participate directly in voting at the Annual General Meeting, if they are unable to attend the meeting.  Shareholders are invited to submit questions ahead of the Annual General Meeting, so that any issues raised by shareholders in  advance can be responded to. There is also an opportunity for shareholders to ask questions or comment on matters relevant to Nine  at the Annual General Meeting. The Company’s auditor is always present at Annual General Meetings to answer questions about the  conduct of the audit and the audit report.  For some years, Nine has put all resolutions at its Annual General Meeting to shareholders by a poll, rather than by a show of hands.  This is to support the principle of “one share, one vote” which is captured by the ASX Listing Rules, and ensures that the outcome of  resolutions reflects the will of the shareholders.  6.6 Whistleblower Policy  Nine has a Whistleblower Policy which applies to all Directors and employees of Nine and its subsidiaries and has appointed a third  party service provider to provide a confidential, anonymous means for notifications to be provided under the Whistleblower Policy.  Any material incidents reported under that policy will be reported to the People & Remuneration Committee or, if the incident relates to  fraud or other financial misconduct, to the Audit & Risk Management Committee.  A copy of the policy is available on Nine’s website.  48 Nine Entertainment Co. 48 Nine Entertainment Co.  ===== PAGE 51 ===== F I N A N C I A L  R E P O RT  2 0 2 3 CONTENTS Directors’ Report	 50 Auditor’s Independence Declaration	 55 Remuneration Report (Audited)	 56 Operating and Financial Review	 76 Consolidated Financial Statements	 82 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements	 87 Directors’ Declaration	 149 Independent Auditor’s Report	 150  ===== PAGE 52 ===== The Directors present the financial report for the year ended 30 June 2023.

Following a record year in FY22, financial year 2023 was challenged by the economic and operating environment. Nine still delivered  a strong result for FY23 and on a pre-specific item basis, Nine delivered Group EBITDA of $591 million and a Net Profit After Tax of  $262 million (pre specific items), the second highest Group result recorded. We continued to execute on our strategy of investment  in high quality content which resulted in growth in audiences and revenue share, and our ongoing digital transformation with strong  results in 9Now and Stan. Our digital earnings now account for 58% of Group EBITDA.  Nine’s remuneration structure awards short and long term incentives to Nine’s Executive Key Management Personnel (Executive KMP)  based on metrics which are aligned with the creation of shareholder value.  FY23 Short-Term Incentives outcomes  The Short Term Incentive plan for FY23 was structured with 50% allocated to achievement of the Group EBITDA target and 50%  allocated to individual objectives which were made up of financial and non-financial objectives aligned to our strategy. In challenging environment and market conditions, the Group EBITDA result of $591 million (pre specific items) did not meet the  target set by the Board of $675 million (pre specific items), and therefore no bonus was paid to Executive KMP for this portion of the  STI. The Individual objectives were assessed by the Board and were mainly achieved at target performance, resulting in overall STI  outcomes for Executive KMP being below target opportunity for FY23.  FY21 Long-Term Incentives Plan outcome in FY23 The FY21 Long Term Incentive Plan (LTI) grant was tested at the conclusion of FY23. The required targets for the FY21 LTI grant were  Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and Earnings Per Share Growth (EPSG) weighted to 50% each (40% for the CEO) measured over a  three-year performance period for all LTI participants. The CEO had a further Strategic hurdle based on Nine digital transformation  weighted at 20%. The EPSG target was achieved which resulted in 100% vesting of this portion of the grant.  The TSR performance was achieved, resulting in vesting of 100% of the rights attributable to that hurdle.  The Strategic hurdle only applies to the CEO and, for the FY21 LTI grant, was based on measures of success related to Nine’s digital  transformation strategy. The Board determined that the Digital transformation objectives had been mostly achieved and vested 95%  of this portion of the grant.  This resulted in the CEO receiving 99% and other Executive KMP receiving 100% of the maximum possible benefits under the FY21 LTI.  The unvested FY21 LTI Rights lapsed. Changes in remuneration during FY23  During the year, the Board reviewed the Executive remuneration arrangements taking into consideration the performance of the  Executives and appropriate external benchmarking, and increased the fixed remuneration by 3% for both Michael Stephenson and  Maria Phillips effective from 1 July 2022.  There was no change to the CEO remuneration, or the Directors’ fees in FY23. LETTER FROM COMMITTEE CHAIR Annual Report 2023 57 Overview Corporate Governance Directors’ Report Operating and Financial Review Financial Statements Shareholder Information Corporate Directory  ===== PAGE 60 ===== Changes in FY24  The People and Remuneration Committee and the Board review the Executive Remuneration Framework and the Executive team  remuneration arrangements on an annual basis.  Following a review of CEO Mike Sneesby and the Executive team remuneration arrangements, the Board increased the fixed  remuneration of Mike Sneesby by 7.1% to $1,500,000, and Michael Stephenson by 4% to $990,000 effective from 1 July 2023.  Mike Sneesby has not had an increase in his fixed remuneration since his appointment as CEO in 2021. The Board took into  consideration appropriate external benchmarking and the performance of executives in making its decision.  Whilst we have made no changes to the structures of the STI plan, we have made one change to the LTI plan for FY24. Given the  nature of the media business, and ongoing economic uncertainties, the Board made the decision to change the Earnings Per Share  (EPS) performance hurdle, which represents 40% of the performance required for vesting, from a compound annual growth rate (CAGR)  approach to a point to point measure. The Board and Management believe this approach removes volatility in years one and two, and  incentivises management to drive medium term growth to FY26. Point to point was previously used in the FY21 LTI Plan (just vested).  Going forward, our intention is to maintain a point to point measure in future LTI plans, rather than applying a CAGR hurdle. Following the departure of CFO Maria Phillips from Nine on 4 August 2023, the business took the opportunity to restructure the  executive team with Matt Stanton taking up the new role of Chief Financial and Strategy Officer effective from 7 August 2023.  Bringing the finance and strategy teams together will enhance Nine’s capacity in dealings with our commercial partners and driving  efficiency across the business. Maria has been a valued member of the Nine Executive team since she joined Nine three years ago,  including leading Nine’s finance transformation. On behalf of the Board, I wish Maria well in the next chapter of her career. In closing, FY23 has been a strong year for Nine despite the economic and operating challenges faced. On behalf of the Board I would  like to thank Mike, the Executives and the entire Nine team for continuing to execute the strategic priorities of the business to create  value for shareholders.  I trust you will find this report informative. I encourage you to vote in favour of the report and welcome any questions at the Annual  General Meeting.

The group financial measure rewards Group  performance.  Individual measures reflect individual’s  performance and contribution to the  achievement of both Group and business unit  short and long term objectives. This year’s  focus was on executing key FY23 initiatives  including continuing the growth in the digital  business revenue and audiences, securing key  commercial content, cost base management,  embedding our Purpose and Values across  the Group, and building on the Executive  team structure and effectiveness including  development and succession plans.  A portion is paid in cash (67%) and a portion  (33%) delivered as Nine shares deferred for up  to two years to ensure continued alignment to  shareholder outcomes.

Creates a strong link with the creation of  shareholder value. Relative TSR was chosen as it provides an  external market performance measure having  regard to S&P/ASX 200 Index companies  representing Consumer Discretionary,  Consumer Staples, Information Technology and  Communication Services. EPSG was chosen as it aligns with shareholder  dividends over time.  Strategic and transformation objectives are  chosen to focus on key initiatives to position  Nine for medium to long term growth and  sustainability. For the FY23 grant, performance  was based on measures supporting Nine’s  continued transformation as a digitally focused  organisation, including but not limited to growth  in digital EBITDA, digital revenue growth, and  growth in non-advertising revenue. Total Remuneration The remuneration mix is designed to align Executive remuneration and rewards to the creation of long term shareholder  value. The remuneration of Executive KMP is set on appointment and then reviewed annually. We set both fixed  remuneration and the total remuneration opportunity by considering factors such as experience, competence and  performance in the role, competitive market pressures and internal equity with peers. 60 Nine Entertainment Co. Remuneration Report (Audited)  ===== PAGE 63 ===== 2.1 Summary of remuneration outcomes for current Executive KMP  The table below is a summary of remuneration outcomes for financial year 2023.  Fixed remuneration •	 Following a review of the Executive team’s remuneration arrangements by the Board, Ms Phillips and  Mr Stephenson received a 3% increase in fixed remuneration effective 1 July 2022.  •	 During FY23 there was no increase to the fixed remuneration of Mr Sneesby.  Short-term incentive (STI) •	 The Group financial target for FY23 was set at Group EBITDA of $675 million (before specific items).  •	 The reported FY23 Group EBITDA (before specific items) was $591 million, resulting in the Group Financial  target not being achieved and therefore no payment for this portion of the STI. This represents 50% of the  STI opportunity.  •	 The Individual measures were assessed against specific targets and awarded where achieved.  This represents 50% of the STI opportunity.  •	 FY23 short-term incentive payments to Executive KMP were consequently below target levels at payouts  of between 50% and 52% of target opportunity. Long-term Incentive (LTI) •	 LTI grants were made in line with plan rules for Executive KMP in financial year 2023. Award vesting •	 LTI grants made in financial year 2021 were tested at 30 June 2023 in line with the plan rules.  •	 TSR requirements were met, resulting in maximum vesting of this portion of the grant (40% of the total grant  for the CEO and 50% for other KMP) •	 The EPS growth target was achieved at maximum performance, resulting in maximum vesting of this  portion of the grant (40% of the total grant for the CEO and 50% for other KMP).  •	 The Strategic hurdle is only applicable to the CEO and for the FY21 LTI grant was based on measures of  success related to Nine’s digital transformation strategy. The Board assessed the overall performance of  this hurdle on an aggregate basis and vested 95% of this portion of the grant (19% of the CEO’s total grant).  •	 The CEO received 99% and other Executive KMP received 100% of the possible benefits under the FY21  LTI plan.  •	 The unvested FY21 Rights lapsed.  Non-executive director fees •	 The total amount paid by Nine to Non-Executive Directors in financial year 2023 was $983,125. This is well  below the aggregate fee pool of $3 million approved by shareholders at the AGM on 21 October 2013. 3. Executive Remuneration  3.1 Remuneration Principles The remuneration framework is designed to attract and retain high performing individuals, align executive reward to Nine’s business  objectives and to create shareholder value. The remuneration framework reflects the Company’s remuneration approach and  considers industry and market practices and advice from independent external advisers. The Company’s Executive reward structure is designed to: •	 Align rewards to the creation of shareholder value, implementation of business strategy and delivery of results; •	 Implement targeted goals that encourage high performance and establish a clear link between executive remuneration and  performance, both at Company and individual business unit levels; •	 Attract, retain and motivate high calibre executives for key business roles; •	 Provide a balance between fixed remuneration and at-risk elements and short and long-term outcomes that encourages  appropriate behaviour to provide reward for short-term delivery and long-term sustainability; and •	 Implement an industry competitive remuneration structure. Annual Report 2023 61 Overview Corporate Governance Directors’ Report Operating and Financial Review Financial Statements Shareholder Information Corporate Directory  ===== PAGE 64 ===== 3.2 Approach to Setting Remuneration  Our Executive KMP reward is designed to support and reinforce the Nine strategy, reward delivery against our objectives and align to  returns to shareholders. The Group aims to reward the Chief Executive Officer and other Executive KMP with competitive remuneration  and benefits based on consideration of all the relevant inputs and provides a mix of remuneration (comprising fixed remuneration, short  and long-term incentives) appropriate to their position, responsibilities and performance within the Group and aligned with industry and  market practice.  The key components of the remuneration framework for Executive KMP detailed in this remuneration report include fixed remuneration  and at-risk remuneration:  •	 Fixed remuneration is made up of base salary, non-monetary benefits and superannuation; and •	 At-Risk remuneration is made up of Short Term and Long Term incentives which form the at-risk component of Executive KMP  remuneration. The Company reviews remuneration on a periodic and case-by-case basis taking into consideration market data, performance of  the Company and individual and market conditions. The policy is to position remuneration for Executive KMP principally within a  competitive range of industry peers in light of the small pool of executive talent with appropriate media and entertainment industry  experience and skills. There is also consideration of other Australian listed companies of a similar size, complexity and prominence.  The tables in section 3.3 summarise the Executive KMP remuneration structure and mix under the Company’s Remuneration  Framework.  3.3 Remuneration Mix (at target)  Chief Executive Officer Fixed Remuneration Short-Term Incentive Long-Term Incentive 30.8% 30.8% 38.4% Total at Risk 69.2% Cash – 67% Deferred Shares – 33% Other Executive KMP Fixed Remuneration Short-Term Incentive Long-Term Incentive 50% 25% 25% Total at Risk 50% Cash – 67% Deferred Shares – 33% Longer term focus through incentive deferral The remuneration mix is structured so that a substantial portion of remuneration is delivered through Deferred STI or LTI. The table  below shows that remuneration awards to Executive KMPs are earned over a period of up to three years. This ensures that the  interests of executives are aligned with shareholders and the delivery of the long-term business strategy.  Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Fixed remuneration     STI – cash (67%) STI – deferred shares (16.5%) STI – deferred shares (16.5%) LTI – 3 year performance period     3.4 Fixed Remuneration  Fixed remuneration represents the amount comprising base salary, non-monetary benefits and superannuation appropriate to the  Executive KMP’s role. Fixed Remuneration is set at a competitive level to attract and retain talent and considers the scope of the role,  knowledge and experience of the individual and the internal and external market. 62 Nine Entertainment Co. Remuneration Report (Audited)  ===== PAGE 65 ===== 3.5 Short Term Incentive (STI) Plan  Purpose and overview •	 The STI plan is the annual incentive plan that is used for the Executive KMPs and other Executives.  The STI plan is designed to align individual performance to the achievement of the business strategy and  increased shareholder value.  •	 Awards are made annually and are aligned to the attainment of clearly defined Group, business unit and  individual targets.  •	 The STI plan is subject to annual review by the People and Remuneration Committee (PRC). The structure,  performance measures and weightings may therefore vary from year to year.  STI funding •	 The pool to fund STI rewards is determined by the Group’s financial performance before specific items.  Weighting of STI Measures  •	 The STI is weighted 50% to a Group financial measure and 50% to individual objectives. STI Opportunity (at target) % of fixed remuneration CEO 100% Other Executive KMP 50% Group Financial Measures  (50% of the STI) •	 Group EBITDA – chosen as it aligns executive performance with the key drivers of shareholder value and  reflects the short-term performance of the business.  •	 Group financial performance measures for future years will be determined annually.  •	 Payouts based on financial measures are detailed below (pro-rata between bands). % Payout (of Group Financial Component) Performance against target CEO Other Executive  KMP <95% Subject to Board  consideration Subject to Board  consideration 95% 50% 50% 100% 100% 100% 105% 105% 110% 110% 112.5% 125% >115% 125% 150% Individual Objectives  (50% of the STI) •	 Executive KMPs are assigned individual objectives based on their specific area of responsibility. These  objectives are set annually and are directly aligned to the Board approved financial, operational and  strategic objectives and include quantitative measures where appropriate. At least one objective will be  a non-financial measure. Weightings are assigned to each objective to reflect their relative importance to  delivery of the strategy and required focus.  •	 This year’s focus was on executing key initiatives including continuing the growth in the digital business  revenue and audiences, securing key commercial content, cost base management, embedding our  Purpose and Values across the Group, and to build on the Executive team structure and effectiveness  including development and succession plans. Payouts based on individual measures are detailed below. % Payout (of Individual Component) Performance Assessment based on delivery of Individual KPIs CEO Other Executive  KMP Unsatisfactory Nil Nil Performance Requires Development 25 – 75% 25 – 75% Valued Contribution 75 – 100% 75 – 110% Superior Contribution 100 – 110% 110 – 130% Exceptional Contribution 110 – 125% 130 – 150% Annual Report 2023 63 Overview Corporate Governance Directors’ Report Operating and Financial Review Financial Statements Shareholder Information Corporate Directory  ===== PAGE 66 ===== Deferred STI Payment •	 33% of any STI outcome is deferred into Nine shares (Shares) that vest in two tranches and cannot be  traded until after they have vested. •	 Any unvested Shares may be forfeited if the executive ceases to be an employee before a vesting date. The following allocation of any STI payment between cash and Shares applies for financial year 2023: Cash Deferred Shares Date Payable/of Vesting Following results  release 1 year  following end  of performance  period 2 years  following end  of performance  period Percentage 67% 16.5% 16.5% •	 The number of Shares subject to deferral is determined by dividing the deferred STI amount (being 33%  of the STI payable) by the volume weighted average price (VWAP). VWAP is calculated over the period  commencing 5 trading days before and ending 4 trading days after the performance period results release  (i.e. over a total period of 10 trading days). •	 The Executive KMP will receive all benefits of holding the Shares in the period before vesting, including  dividends, capital returns and voting rights.  •	 Shares which have vested can only be traded, within specified trading windows, consistent with Nine’s  Securities Trading Policy or any applicable laws (such as the insider trading provisions). •	 The Board has determined that Shares will be acquired on-market to satisfy any awards under this  component of the STI Plan. Assessment and Board  discretion •	 Actual performance against Group financial and individual measures is assessed at the end of the  financial year.  •	 In assessing the achievement of Group financial and individual measures the People and Remuneration  Committee (PRC) may recommend that the Board exercise its discretion to adjust outcomes for significant  factors that are considered outside the control of management that contribute positively or negatively to  results. Adjustments are by exception and are not intended to be regular. Any adjustment will require the  judgement of the Board and will balance fair outcomes that reflect management’s delivery of financial  performance, with the outcomes experienced by Nine’s shareholders.  •	 The Board determines the amount, if any, of the short-term incentive to be paid to each Executive KMP,  seeking recommendations from the PRC and CEO as appropriate, as well as the Chair of the Audit and  Risk Committee. •	 For significant outperformance of financial measures and individual objectives, executives may be awarded  an STI payment of up to 125% for the CEO, and 150% for other executives, of the target STI.  •	 The Board has the discretion to clawback awards made under the Short Term Incentive plan to ensure that  participants do not unfairly benefit, including in the event of fraud, dishonesty or a breach of obligation to  the Company. In addition, the Board may also clawback awards in the case of material risk issues arising or  where any information becomes available after awards are granted, which suggests that the outcome was  not justified. 64 Nine Entertainment Co. Remuneration Report (Audited)  ===== PAGE 67 ===== 3.6 Long Term Incentive (LTI) Plan  The LTI plan involves the annual granting of conditional Performance Rights to participants. Overview The Long Term Incentive Plan is an equity incentive plan used to align the Executive KMP remuneration to the  returns generated for Nine shareholders.  Grant Date  The FY23 grant was issued on 1 December 2022 and remains on foot (subject to testing against vesting  conditions at the end of the performance period). Consideration Nil  Award Performance Rights are awarded based on the fixed amount to which the individual is entitled divided by the  VWAP. The VWAP is calculated over the period commencing 5 trading days before and ending 4 trading days  after the results release immediately following the start of the performance period (i.e. over a total period of  10 trading days). Upon satisfaction of Vesting Conditions, each Performance Right will, at the Company’s election convert to a  Share on a one-for-one basis, or at the Board’s discretion, entitle the Participant to receive cash to the value of a  Share. No amount is payable on conversion. LTI opportunity (at target) % of fixed  remuneration CEO 125% Other Executive KMP  50% Performance Period For the FY23 grant, the performance period is the three year period from 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2025  (Vesting Date). Vesting Dates Subject to the Vesting Conditions and Employment Conditions described below, Performance Rights held by  each Participant will vest on the Vesting Date (with no opportunity to retest). Vesting Conditions Performance Rights granted for the FY23 allocation will vest on performance of the following hurdles: •	 Total Shareholder Return (TSR) Hurdle:  40% of the FY23 grant is subject to the Company’s TSR performance against S&P/ASX 200 Index companies  representing Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Information Technology and Communication  Services. TSR was chosen as it provides a relative, external market performance measure. TSR vesting schedule: Outcome Vesting Ranked at the 75th percentile or higher (Maximum) 100% Ranked at the 50th percentile (Threshold) 50% Ranked below the 50th percentile 0% Vesting is pro-rated if the outcome is between the Threshold and Maximum band.  •	 Earnings Per Share Growth (ESPG) Hurdle:  40% of the FY23 grant is subject to the achievement of fully diluted Earnings Per Share Growth (EPSG)  targets as set by the Board over the Performance Period. EPSG was chosen as it aligns with shareholder  dividends over time and provides a clear focus on meeting the earnings expectations delivered to the  market.  EPSG vesting schedule: Outcome Vesting The EPSG hurdle assesses cumulative growth in EPS as the sum of the annual EPS growth  relative to an EPS starting point determined by the Board. This is calculated at the end of  each financial year over the performance period. Vesting occurs when:  Cumulative annual growth over the period exceeds the Maximum Vesting Target 100% Cumulative annual growth over the period exceeds the Threshold 33% Cumulative annual growth over the period of less than the Threshold 0% Annual Report 2023 65 Overview Corporate Governance Directors’ Report Operating and Financial Review Financial Statements Shareholder Information Corporate Directory  ===== PAGE 68 ===== Vesting Conditions  continued Vesting is pro-rated if the outcome is between the Threshold and Maximum band. EPSG hurdles are determined at the issue of each grant having regard to factors including: •	 Internal forecasting estimates, taking into account the outlook for the industry •	 Market expectations, including reference to sell-side equity analyst forecasts •	 Recent actual performance •	 Market practice and competitor benchmarking Due to the competitively sensitive nature of these hurdles and the implied outlook for Nine earnings, the Nine  Board has determined to disclose these EPSG targets upon vesting of any performance rights. •	 Strategic Hurdle – Digital strategy:  20% of the FY23 grant is subject to a strategic hurdle. For the FY23 grant, performance will be assessed on  measures supporting Nine’s continued transformation as a digitally focused organisation, including but not  limited to growth in digital EBITDA, digital revenue growth, and growth in non-advertising revenue. The number of rights that vest will be based on the Board’s assessment of performance, on an aggregated  level, across a group of quantitative measures.  Due to the competitively sensitive nature of these digital measures, the Nine Board has determined to  disclose their assessment upon vesting of any performance rights. The Board may vary the Vesting Conditions for each Plan issue.  The PRC undertakes reviews of the targets on LTI grants on-foot to ensure they remain relevant in light of any  Company transactions and external or legislative impacts.  Cessation of employment (Employment Conditions) If the Participant is not employed by Nine or any Nine Group member on a particular Vesting Date due to the  Participant:  –	 having been summarily dismissed;  –	 resigning (subject to the Board exercising discretion to allow rights to be retained); or –	 having terminated his/her employment agreement otherwise than in accordance with the terms of that  agreement,  any unvested Performance Rights held on or after the date of termination will lapse. If the Participant has ceased to be employed by Nine in any other circumstances (e.g. redundancy, retirement,  ill health), the Participant will retain a time based, pro-rated number of unvested Performance Rights determined  on a tranche by tranche basis (where the time based proportion of each tranche is determined as the length  of time from the start of the performance period to the date on which employment ceases divided by the total  performance period of a particular tranche).  Any unvested Performance Rights that do not lapse in accordance with the above, remain on foot until the  relevant Vesting Date. Any vesting at that time will be determined based on Vesting Conditions for those  Performance Rights being met. Disposal restrictions Where vesting occurs during a trading blackout period under the Company’s Securities Trading Policy, any  Shares issued or transferred to the Participant upon vesting of any Performance Rights will be subject to  restrictions on disposal from the date of issue (or transfer) of the Shares until the commencement of the  business day following the end of that blackout period, or such later date that the Board may determine  under the Company’s Securities Trading Policy. A Participant may not enter into any arrangement for the purpose of hedging, or otherwise affecting their  economic exposure to their Performance Rights. Clawback provision The Board has the discretion to clawback awards made under the Long Term Incentive plans to ensure that  participants do not unfairly benefit, including in the event of fraud, dishonesty or a breach of obligation to  the Company.  In addition, the Board may also clawback awards in the case of material risk issues arising or where any  information becomes available after awards are granted (whether vested or unvested), which suggests that the  initial grant or result was not justified. Change of control The Board has the discretion to accelerate vesting of some or all of a Participant’s Performance Rights in the  event of certain transactions which may result in a change of control of Nine Entertainment Co. Holdings Ltd.  The discretion will be exercised having regard to all relevant circumstances at the time. Unvested Performance  Rights will remain in place unless the Board determines to exercise that discretion. Amendments To the extent permitted by the ASX Listing Rules, the Board retains the discretion to vary the terms and  conditions of the Performance Rights Plan. This includes varying the number of Performance Rights or the  number of Shares to which a Participant is entitled upon a reorganisation of capital of Nine. Capital Initiatives The Board will endeavour to amend the terms of any Performance Rights on issue to equitably deal with  any capital return, share consolidation or share split, such that the value of those rights is not prejudiced.  The Board’s actions in this regard will be at their sole discretion. 66 Nine Entertainment Co. Remuneration Report (Audited)  ===== PAGE 69 ===== 4. Linking Pay to Performance 4.1 Link Between Remuneration and Company Performance  A key principle of the Nine remuneration framework is to align Executive remuneration outcomes with the Company performance.  The People & Remuneration Committee makes recommendations to the Board on performance objectives, both financial and non- financial, for Executive KMP which are intended to be strongly linked between remuneration outcomes and shareholder value.  The Company performance and remuneration outcomes link is demonstrated in the STI plan with 50% linked to the Group’s Financial  target (Group EBITDA for FY23) and the remaining 50% related to Individual Objectives made up of both a financial and non-financial  nature.  In the LTI plan, Company performance and remuneration outcomes are linked with key shareholder value measures of Earnings Per  Share, relative TSR, and a strategic hurdle based on digital transformation required to be achieved for any vesting to occur for all  LTI participants.  The following table provides a summary of the Group financial performance over the last five years and the link to Executive KMP  remuneration outcomes over this period.  30 June 231 $m 30 June 221 $m 30 June 211 $m 30 June 201 Restated2 $m 30 June 193 Pro-Forma  $m 30 June 194 $m Revenue  2,694.6 2,688.8 2,331.5 2,155.3 2,341.7 1,965.1 Group EBITDA 591.2 700.7 564.7 394.8 423.8 349.9 Group EBITDA % 22% 26% 24% 18% 18% 18% Digital EBITDA % of Group EBITDA 58% 51% 44% 48% 27% – Net Profit after Tax and Minorities   (pre specific items) 262.1 348.5 261.1 142.4 224.8 187.1 Earnings per share – cents 15.7 cents 20.5 cents 15.3 cents 8.3 cents 11.6 cents 13.0 cents   30 June 23 Cents/Share 30 June 22 Cents/Share 30 June 21 Cents/Share 30 June 20 Cents/Share 30 June 19 Cents/Share 30 June 19 Cents/Share Opening share price 183 291 138 188 248 248 Closing share price 196 183 291 138 188 188 Dividend 11 14 10.5 7 10 10 Executive KMP STI Payments 30 June 23 30 June 22 30 June 21 30 June 20 30 June 19 30 June 19 Awarded 51%  124%  131% 0% 69% 69% Forfeited (at target) 49%  –  – 100% 31% 31% 1.

Annual Report 2023 67 Overview Corporate Governance Directors’ Report Operating and Financial Review Financial Statements Shareholder Information Corporate Directory  ===== PAGE 70 ===== 4.2 Short Term Incentives (STI) Outcomes  The Short Term Incentive Plan for Executive KMP in FY23 was allocated 50% towards the achievement of the Group EBITDA target  and the remaining 50% for individual measures that reflect the individuals’ performance and contribution to the achievement of both  Group and business unit objectives. In a challenging operating environment, the FY23 reported Group EBITDA result of $591 million (pre specific items) did not meet  the target set by the Board of $675 million (pre specific items) and therefore no bonus was paid to Executive KMP for this portion  of the STI.  For each Executive KMP, clear targets for the Individual Objectives that were important to the delivery of the company’s strategic goals  were agreed. For FY23, the focus was on executing key initiatives including continuing the growth in the digital business revenue and  audiences, securing key commercial content, cost base management, embedding our Purpose and Values across the Group, and  building on the Executive team structure and effectiveness including development and succession plans. The Individual measures  were assessed by the PRC who made recommendations to the Board and were mainly achieved at target performance. The Board  believes the overall STI outcomes appropriately reflected the performance in FY23. The proportions of target and maximum STI that were awarded and forfeited by each Executive KMP in relation to the current financial  year and last year are set out below.

Remuneration Report (Audited)  ===== PAGE 71 ===== The performance period of the FY21 Long Term Incentive Plan (FY21 LTI) commenced on 1 July 2020 and expired on 30 June 2023.  Performance was assessed at the conclusion of the 2023 financial year, and as a result of performance over the three year period,  almost full vesting was achieved.  The Total Shareholder Return (TSR) hurdle was achieved at the 78th percentile which was above the maximum required level of  performance, and therefore resulted in 100% vesting of this portion of the grant.  In setting the Earnings Per Share Growth (EPSG) targets for the FY21 LTI plan, in the midst of impacts relating to the global pandemic  COVID-19, the Board changed the calculation method for EPSG from a cumulative CAGR approach to a point-to-point calculation.  This change was made to acknowledge the potential impacts surrounding COVID-19, such as the volatility and uncertainty surrounding  the impacts and future recovery. The growth targets were set at threshold 6.1% (2% per annum compounding) and maximum 15.8%  (5% per annum compounding) on a point-to-point calculation basis. This is from a pre COVID-19 starting point using the FY19 adjusted  pro forma EPS of 10.5c. This change was communicated to shareholders in the People & Remuneration Committee Chair’s Letter in the  FY20 Remuneration Report. The EPS growth performance over the three-year period was achieved at maximum performance which  resulted in 100% vesting of this portion of the grant. For the FY21 LTI plan, the Strategic hurdle focused on Digital transformation and was only applicable to the CEO. The Board  assessed the overall performance of this hurdle on an aggregate basis, taking into account the success of key indicators in the digital  transformation strategy, including but not limited to, digital revenue growth measures and subscription revenue growth expectations  that met their targets, Digital EBITDA which grew to 58% of overall Group EBITDA, and strong performances in 9Now, Metro digital  platforms, and Stan. The Board therefore determined that the Digital transformation objectives had mostly been achieved and on an  aggregate basis vested 95% of this portion of the grant.  The unvested FY21 rights lapsed. There is no retesting of the hurdles. 5. Executive Agreements  Each Executive KMP has a formal employment agreement. Each of these employment agreements, which are of a continuing nature  and have no fixed term, provide for the payment of fixed and performance-based remuneration, superannuation and other benefits  such as statutory leave entitlements. The key terms of current Executive KMP contracts at 30 June 2023 were as follows:  Fixed  Remuneration1 Target  STI Target  LTI Notice Period by  Executive Notice Period by  Company Restraint Mike Sneesby $1,400,000 $1,400,000 $1,750,000 12 months 12 months 12 months Maria Phillips  $741,600 $370,800 $370,800 12 months 12 months 12 months Michael Stephenson $951,720 $475,860 $475,860 12 months 12 months 12 months 1.	 Fixed remuneration comprises of base cash remuneration, superannuation and other non-monetary benefits. 6. Remuneration Governance  6.1 The Board  The Board approves the remuneration arrangements of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and other key executives and awards made  under short-term incentive (STI) and long-term incentive (LTI) plans, following recommendations from the PRC. The Board also sets the  remuneration levels of Non-Executive Directors (NEDs), subject to the aggregate pool limit approved by shareholders.  6.2 The People and Remuneration Committee (PRC) The PRC assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities for corporate governance and oversight of Nine’s human resources policies and  practices and workplace health and safety (WHS) management. The PRC’s goal is to ensure that Nine attracts the industry’s best talent,  appropriately aligns their interests with those of key stakeholders, complies with WHS obligations and effectively manages WHS risks.  The PRC makes recommendations to the Board on CEO and Non-Executive Director remuneration. The PRC approves the executive  reward strategy, and incentive plans and provides oversight of management’s implementation of approved arrangements.  Details of the membership, number and attendance at meetings held by the PRC are set out on page 52 of the Directors’ Report.  Further information on the PRC’s role, responsibilities and membership is included in the committee charter which is available  on Nine’s website (www.nineforbrands.com.au). Annual Report 2023 69 Overview Corporate Governance Directors’ Report Operating and Financial Review Financial Statements Shareholder Information Corporate Directory  ===== PAGE 72 ===== 6.3 Management Management prepares recommendations and information for the PRC’s consideration and approval. Management also implements the  approved remuneration arrangements.  6.4 Use of Remuneration Consultants From time to time, the PRC seeks external independent remuneration advice. Remuneration consultants are engaged by, and report  directly to, the Committee. In selecting a remuneration consultant, the Committee considers potential conflicts of interest and requires  the consultant’s independence from management as part of their terms of engagement. Where the consultant’s engagement requires a remuneration recommendation, the recommendation is provided to the Chair of the  PRC to ensure management cannot unduly influence the outcome. There were no remuneration recommendations provided to the Committee by any consultants in the 2023 financial year.  6.5 Associated Policies The Company has established a number of policies to support reward and governance, including the Code of Conduct, Disclosure  Policy and Securities Trading Policy. These policies have been implemented to promote ethical behaviour and responsible decision  making. These policies are available on Nine’s website (www.nineforbrands.com.au). 7. Detailed disclosure of executive remuneration 7.1 Non-statutory remuneration disclosures  The actual remuneration awarded to current Executive KMPs in the year ended 30 June 2023 (FY23) is set out in the table below.  This information is considered to be relevant as it provides details of the remuneration actually receivable by the Company’s Executive  KMPs in regard to FY23. STI amounts include both the cash and deferred shares elements awarded for the respective financial year.  Only LTIs which were tested and have vested during the year are included. The table differs from the statutory disclosure in Section 7.2  principally because the table in Section 7.2 includes a value for LTI which may or may not vest in future years.

The shareholders of Nine approved an aggregate fee pool of $3 million at the AGM on 21 October 2013. The Board will not seek any  increase to the NED fee pool at the 2023 AGM.  8.2 Structure The remuneration of NEDs consists of Directors’ fees and Committee fees. The payment of additional fees for serving on a committee  recognises the additional time commitment required by NEDs who serve on committees. The Chairman of the Board does not receive  any additional fees in addition to Board fees for being a member of any committee. All Board fees include any superannuation  entitlements, as applicable. These arrangements are set out in the written engagement letters with each Director.  The NED fees are set out below:  Role Fees  Chairman $374,000 Directors $148,500 Audit and Risk Committee chair $33,000 Audit and Risk Committee member $20,000 People and Remuneration Committee chair $27,500 People and Remuneration Committee member $15,000 NEDs do not receive retirement benefits, nor do they participate in any incentive programs.

Revenue before Specific items held stable during the year, showing a marginal increase of $5.8 million (0%) to $2,694.6 million. This  result was underpinned by continued audience strength across all key platforms, driven by Nine's premium content, and was achieved  in an increasingly challenging and uncertain macro-economic environment which impacted most of the markets that Nine operates in.  Group EBITDA before Specific Items decreased by $109.5 million (16%) to $591.2 million with the increase in costs, which were primarily  a result of investment in premium content, flowing to EBITDA. Depreciation and Amortisation increased by 4% at $155.7 million and Net  Finance Costs increased from $25.2 million in the prior year to $41.3 million in the current year, as a result of increased debt drawdown  and rising interest rates.  Specific Items of $119.1 million pre-tax (refer to Note 2.4) relate principally to the impairment of assets in the radio cash generating unit  ($84.5 million), Impairment of other assets ($19.6 million) and group restructuring costs ($14.7 million).  Operating Cash Flow decreased $135.4 million to $351.8 million year-on-year due to the decrease in the EBITDA. In addition, the  Group commenced an on-market buyback during the year, purchasing 4.6% of total issued share capital for a total of $154.0 million.  The Group made dividend payments of $219.6 million, or 13.0 cents per share, to shareholders during the year. Net Debt at 30 June  2023 was $523.2 million (excluding lease liabilities) which resulted in net leverage of 0.9x, well within bank covenants.

Together, Broadcast reported  EBITDA of $320 million on revenues of $1.4 billion for the 12 months. Whilst down on the record FY22 result, Nine Broadcast’s FY23  result was above pre-COVID levels.  Both Nine Network and 9Now comfortably outperformed their respective markets, growing Total Television share to an historically  high level of 41.8% for the year, up 2.8 percentage points on FY22. Total Television revenue of $1.2 billion, was down 2% on FY22, with  growth from 9Now close to offsetting the impact of weaker advertising markets on Nine Network. EBITDA of $307 million was down  20% on FY22. The Metro Free-To-Air (FTA) advertising market declined by 11%1 for the year, and 15% for the second half, reflecting both the underlying  weaker economy as well as Election-affected comparables. Nine Network markedly outperformed, with second half share growth of  1.4 percentage points to 42.0% resulting in a Metro Free to Air (FTA) revenue share for FY23 of 40.7%, which is a more than 20-year  high. As a result, Nine Network reported a revenue decline of just 4% for the 12 months to $1.1 billion.  1.	 Source: Think TV, Metro Free To Air revenue and share, 12 months to June 2023. Annual Report 2023 77 Overview Corporate Governance Directors’ Report Operating and Financial Review Financial Statements Shareholder Information Corporate Directory  ===== PAGE 80 ===== Across the year, Nine Network was the #1 Network and Primary Channel of its targeted 25-54 demographic, attracting a commercial  network share of 39.4%2 and a primary channel share of 40.7%2, the latter a record share for any channel since OzTAM commenced.  Nine Network was also #1 in 16-39s and Grocery Buyers with Children, as well as Total People.  Nine’s revenue from regional markets continues to reflect the strength of our content and affiliation with WIN Corporation. For the  12 months to June, revenue share for Nine’s content across all regional markets (affiliated and wholly-owned) increased by  2.8 percentage points to 38.3%3. In FY23, 9Now revenue growth outperformed both the traditional BVOD market and the digital video market. During the year, 9Now’s  revenue growth of 16% outperformed the traditional BVOD market of 9Now, 7-Plus and Ten Play, which grew by 6% to $392 million3.  Over the same time period, the digital video market is estimated to have grown by ~7% to $3.4 billion4. Live viewing remains the  primary growth audience driver for 9Now and is the key component of Nine’s Total Television strategy. From a live perspective,  Daily Active Users grew by 18%5 for the year, while live streaming minutes were up by 22%5.  Total Television costs increased by just under 7% as Nine continued to invest in its premium leading schedule, with the significant  growth in Nine’s revenue share reflecting the payback from this investment. The 12% first half cost increase, mainly content driven,  was followed by a 3% increase in the second half. The primary components of the second half increase were the step up in NRL  costs and the first part of the 2023 UK Ashes. Excluding these events, second half Total TV costs would have been flat on H2 FY22.  Other programming investments across the year included The Block Treechange as well as the new content adventure strip  The Summit (the format for which has subsequently been sold offshore) and dating series My Mum, Your Dad. The Metro radio advertising market slowed as the year progressed, but still finished the year up 0.2%6 on FY22. Nine gained further  share across the year, with linear advertising revenues up 1% for the year. Digital revenues grew by 115%, which included a doubling of  audio streaming revenues, as Nine’s focus on Total Audio gathers momentum. Costs increased by around $7m or 8%, reflecting both  investment in new content, including digital, and higher sales and marketing costs. Nine Radio’s reported EBITDA of $13 million was  down $3 million on FY22. Digital and Publishing Variance 2023 to 2022 2023 $m 2022 $m $m % Revenue  575.2   593.5   (18.3) (3%) EBITDA 164.7   179.5   (14.8) (8%) Margin  29% 30%    (1 pts)  Nine’s Digital and Publishing division includes the core Metro Media business, as well as nine.com.au, Pedestrian Group and Drive.  Together, Publishing reported revenue of $575 million and a combined EBITDA of $165 million, down 8% on FY22’s record result.  Digital accounts for approximately 60% of Publishing revenue. After a strong first half, Nine Publishing’s full year result was primarily impacted by the softer advertising market. Total advertising  revenue was down by 16% in the second half, after a broadly flat H1, with digital advertising revenue (down 19% in H2 on the prior  comparative period) reflecting softness in programmatic advertising and a decline in print advertising (down 13% in H2 on the prior  comparative period) which compares against a previous corresponding period that was boosted by advertising associated with the  2022 Federal Election. Total subscription revenue grew by 3%, despite the challenging consumer environment. Strong readership across The Sydney  Morning Herald, The Age and The Australian Financial Review continued to translate to paying audiences, showing mid-single digit (%)  growth in digital subscriptions over the past 12 months, to more than 460,000 active subscriptions at June year end. Registered users  also grew, to more than 1.3 million. Print subscription and retail sales revenue slipped slightly across the year, which was more than  offset by digital subscription and licensing revenue growth. This strong audience performance enabled digital price increases to be  implemented in May, the first across the base since the introduction of starter digital and premium digital subscriptions. Publishing costs were slightly lower across the year, with wage increases (EBA-related), higher distribution costs, and incremental  content investment offset by tighter cost controls. In total, Digital and Publishing EBITDA decreased by 8% to ~$165 million for the year. 2.	 Source: OzTam, 6pm-midnight 5 capital cities. 3.

Operating and Financial Review  ===== PAGE 81 ===== Stan Variance 2023 to 2022 2023 $m 2022 $m $m % Revenue  427.6   381.2   46.4  12%  EBITDA  37.1   28.5   8.6  30%  Margin  9% 7%    2 pts  Stan reported 30% growth in EBITDA to $37 million, the Group’s fourth consecutive year of profit and positive cash flow, which is a  strong performance in the context of the economic conditions and competitive environment. Revenue growth of 12% to $428 million for the year was underpinned by price increases across both Entertainment and Sport  subscriptions, reflecting ongoing strong engagement with both platforms, and delivering 9% growth in ARPU7, with minimal churn impact.  The 11% increase in costs partially reflected the continued ramp-up investment in Stan Sport. Ex Sport, costs were up by ~8%, primarily  reflecting the increased roll-out of Stan Originals, the impact of the new Sony output deal and other key licensed content.  Over the past 12 months, Stan’s commitment to expanding Stan Originals, and investing further into Stan Sport, has helped to maximise  the Group’s control over its content pipeline and de-risk the business, particularly pertinent in the context of the ongoing Hollywood  writers’ and actors’ strikes. This also positions Stan well to respond to any opportunities which arise as a result of the strategic shift by  the Hollywood Studios to place greater reliance on profitability and content licensing models, rather than direct-to-consumer streaming  investment. This shift in strategy is expected to lead to more content becoming available to license in Australia, and potentially to  consolidation within the market. Stan’s Originals have been a significant driver of performance, proving to be one of the keys to Stan’s success, delivering four of the  top six series and movies available on Stan in FY23. New original series such as Black Snow, Ten Pound Poms and Bali 2002 attracted  strong viewership, complementing returning series such as Bump and Ru Paul’s Drag Race Down Under as well as Original movies  including Transfusion, Poker Face and The Portable Door. These titles performed strongly alongside key licensed titles including  Yellowstone, Your Honor, From, Lucky Hank and The Great.  Stan Sport also continued to extend its consumer proposition, securing the rights to the Rugby World Cup and successfully  broadcasting the Women’s tournament, as well as the UCI World Championship cycling event in Wollongong. These sports  complement Stan’s already strong line-up including the recently extended UEFA champions league and Grand Slam tennis, domestic  and international rugby, as well as an emerging motorsport and combat sports proposition.

Domain reported EBITDA of  $103 million, down 15% on FY22.  Core digital revenue increased by 1%. Residential listings revenue declined by 7%, with the 8% increase in controllable yield, inclusive  of the impact of Social Boost, more than offset by the 14% decline in property listings. Domain’s Media, Developers and Commercial  business recorded a 3% revenue decline, with Commercial Real Estate, up 6%, the best performing business. Revenue from  Agent Solutions nearly doubled, primarily due to the acquisition of Realbase in April 2022, with underlying growth reported of 6%,  underpinned by 25% revenue growth from Real Time Agent. Domain Insights recorded revenue growth of 16%, boosted by a full period  contribution from IDS, or 4% underlying. In a challenging property market, Domain has made clear progress diversifying its revenue  base, and building on the foundations of its Marketplace Strategy.  Domain reported costs of $251 million, with H2 costs down 18% on H1. Reflecting the lower-than-expected listing volumes, fourth  quarter initiatives included proactive annual leave management, staff recruitment phasing and further discretionary cost controls.  7.

Annual Report 2023 79 Overview Corporate Governance Directors’ Report Operating and Financial Review Financial Statements Shareholder Information Corporate Directory  ===== PAGE 82 ===== Corporate Net corporate profit decreased by $1.4 million or 4% across the year, mainly as a result of a reduction in sublease income related to the  Media house property.  Business Strategies and Future Prospects  The Group has identified and is focused on delivering against the following strategic priorities:  •	 Growing distribution of video content  The Group will continue to strengthen its position as a leading supplier of premium video content in Australia, through its FTA,  Broadcast Video On Demand (9Now) (together “Total TV”) and Subscription (Stan) businesses. Ongoing investment in content that  appeals to Australian audiences, and in platform functionality and prominence, will support the expansion of the Group’s audiences.  By delivering premium content across Entertainment, News and Current Affairs and Sport, the Group’s goal is to increase its revenues  via advertising across our Total TV businesses and subscriptions on Stan. Stan remains on a strong growth trajectory, underpinned  by its focus on investment in Stan Originals, growth in the Stan Sport proposition and extensions to key strategic licensing deals,  supported by increasing efficiency of customer acquisition, a world class platform and cross-promotion across the wider Nine business.  •	 Accelerating the shift to Digital  The Group continues to successfully grow audiences and advertisers on digital platforms across streaming (Total TV, Audio) and  Publishing. This evolution ensures long term sustainability in the business model and increased opportunities to diversify content  and better monetise audiences. Our Metro Publishing business is targeting a doubling of subscribers across our mastheads through  the next five years, 9Now continues to drive growth in Total TV audience for our tentpole entertainment and sport programming and  Nine’s radio audiences continue to increase listening online and via smart speakers and apps.  •	 Continued optimisation of traditional media assets  While the transition to digital platforms is a key driver of long-term success, the Group’s traditional media assets remain important and  optimisation of performance is an ongoing priority. The restructure of the Radio business since acquisition has realised strong growth  in market share as the business builds talkback radio for the new generation. The Group’s Publishing business continues to outperform  the market through its print advertising proposition and achieve cost efficiencies despite structural headwinds. Content investment also  continues to balance targeted investment by platform and the production of content that works across both linear and digital platforms.  •	 Growth of Marketplaces  The Group’s marketplace strategy continues to be led by Domain. Across the economic and real estate cycle, Domain is focused on  continually increasing the value that they bring to their customers and consumers, supporting them at more points of their property  journeys. The business remains structured across Core Listings, Agent Solutions, Consumer Solutions and Property Data Solutions,  each forecast to deliver continued growth. Delivery of this strategy is underpinned by the relationship with and access to Nine’s other  assets, most notably FTA television and digital, building increased brand recognition and enhanced traffic to Domain.com.au.  •	 Optimising connections across platforms  Across its businesses, Nine provides and supports the establishment of valuable connections between content, audiences and  advertisers on a national basis. Product, technology and user experience are at the core of everything the business does, supporting  the production and distribution of the Group’s content and driving premium revenue opportunities. The transition to digital will also  strengthen the Group’s data assets, supporting product initiatives across all business units, improving yields and supporting increased  effectiveness in planning and execution. The Group continues to explore potential opportunities for targeted investment in aligned  growth opportunities, focused on driving long term returns for the business and continuing to build on the scale and diversity of  Nine’s portfolio.  80 Nine Entertainment Co. Operating and Financial Review  ===== PAGE 83 ===== Material Business Risks  The following section outlines the material business risks that may impact on the Group achieving its strategic objectives and business  operations, including the mitigating factors put in place to address those risks. The material risks are not set out in any particular  order and exclude general risks that could have a material effect on most businesses in Australia under normal operating conditions.  These risks are managed on an ongoing basis as part of our risk management framework. Mitigations and strategies to address them  are maintained and regularly reviewed, including via regular reporting to the Board via our Audit & Risk Committee.  Revenue — the major risks which could affect the revenue of the Group are:  •	 Impact of competitor strategies or new market entrants;  •	 A change in the way content is viewed or consumed by audiences;  •	 Transition of advertising towards digital whilst maintaining traditional sources of revenue;  •	 A significant change to advertising market conditions that leads to a prolonged decline in the advertising market or an adverse shift  in FTA television, Radio, Print or Digital publishing relative shares of the broader advertising market;  •	 Creation of successful content and securing quality licensed content;  •	 Nine’s share of the FTA market itself;  •	 Longer term impact of COVID-19, including the timing and extent of recovery and potential for future outbreaks; and •	 Declines in property market conditions.  A key contributor to these risks is a change in audience behaviours and preferences, which in turn impacts advertiser behaviour  and subscription revenue. Peak-time programming performance or loss of key programming rights may also contribute to these  risks materialising. The continued development of alternative forms of media may lead to increased competition for advertising  revenue. Nine’s strategies are focused on ensuring we effectively anticipate and respond to the potential risks through having the  best platforms, creating and securing the content audiences want to consume and delivering it to them when and where they want it.  Our digital strategy enables us to maximise our revenue opportunities across all of our platforms.  Operational — from an operational perspective, the business is subject to operational risks of various kinds, including transmission  failure, systems failure, data loss, reliance on key third party partners, inaccurate reporting, industrial action (such as at film and  television production studios, in sporting competitions broadcast by Nine and in Publishing), defamation and other execution risks,  including those that significantly impact production. These risks could have a negative effect in various ways on Nine’s reputation  and its ability to conduct its business without disruption or at the budgeted level of cost.  Technology, cyber security — Nine’s strategy to leverage all our digital assets requires us to ensure our technology and infrastructure  is able to deliver our content when, and where, our audiences choose to consume it. We invest in the latest technologies to ensure we  remain at the forefront of industry developments, deliver the best experience for our audiences and maximise operating efficiencies.  Whilst the threat of cyber-attacks exists in all businesses, Nine’s reliance on technology and key partners to deliver our products and  services increases the potential impact of cyber risks. We continue to invest in uplifting our cyber capabilities to keep pace with the  ever-evolving cyber security threats. Regulation and Legislation — Nine’s businesses are subject to changes in regulation at Federal, State and local level, as well as  changes in government policy and decisions by the courts. These risks include changes to: the regulatory environment under which  the FTA industry operates; anti-siphoning legislation; the licence conditions under which Nine operates (including the granting of a  fourth FTA television licence in the major markets in which Nine operates); regulation of content; advertising restrictions in relation to  certain types of products; and interpretation of privacy and defamation laws. These risks could adversely impact Nine’s reputation and/ or Nine’s revenues, costs or financial performance. The Group’s internal processes are regularly assessed and tested as part of robust  risk and assurance programs. Further to this, Nine manages the costs of compliance to ensure our costs of doing business are not  significantly impacted. We do this by ensuring we proactively identify changes to regulatory requirements and respond with effective  programs to ensure compliance.  People and culture — The increasingly competitive landscape and the ongoing need for media organisations to remain agile in order  to anticipate and respond to changing audience preferences, continues to place pressure on the competition for talent. The ability  to attract and retain talent with the necessary skills and capabilities to operate in a challenging market, whilst being able to continue  to adapt, is critical to Nine’s success. The ongoing impact of COVID-19 continues to place pressure on securing and retaining talent.  We recognise the increasing challenges to mental wellbeing, not only to our own people but in the community due to broader societal  factors which we manage both through our internal programs and by making responsible content choices. Nine continues to be an  employer of choice by investing in our people through training and development opportunities, promoting diversity and workplace  flexibility, providing support programs and maintaining succession planning.  Domain — Domain is a separate company which is listed on the ASX and has minority investors. As such, decisions by the board and  the actions of Domain must be made having regard to their best interests. This may mean that if their interests diverge from those of  Nine, Domain may adopt an approach contrary to the preferences of Nine.

The reportable segments for the period ended 30 June 2023 are: •	 Broadcasting – includes free to air television activities, 9Now and metropolitan radio networks in Australia. •	 Digital and Publishing – includes Nine Digital (Nine.com.au and other digital activities) and Metropolitan Media (metropolitan  news, sport, lifestyle and business media across various platforms). •	 Domain Group – real estate media and services businesses. •	 Stan – subscription video on demand service. Segment performance is evaluated based on segment earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), before  specific items. Specific items are items that by size and nature or incidence are relevant in explaining the financial performance of  the Group and are excluded when assessing the underlying performance of the business. These are detailed in Note 2.4. Group finance costs on bank facilities, interest income and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to  operating segments. Transfer prices between operating segments are on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties and  are eliminated on consolidation. 2.2 Revenue and other income In the following table, revenue is disaggregated by major products/service lines.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 93 ===== Accounting Policy Revenue The Group recognises revenue only when the performance obligation is satisfied and the control of goods or services is  transferred, typically at the point of being published, broadcast or streamed. Where performance obligations have not been  satisfied, the related revenue is deferred until such time that the performance obligations are met (refer to Note 3.4). Amounts disclosed as revenue are net of commissions, rebates, discounts and returns which are recognised when they can be  reliably measured. The Group determined that the estimates of variable consideration are not constrained based on its historical  experience, business forecasts and the current economic conditions. In addition, the uncertainty on the variable consideration is  generally resolved within a short time frame. The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: Type of sales revenue Recognition Criteria Advertising revenue Broadcasting •	 Recognised by reference to when an advertisement has been broadcast and specific viewer  metrics contained in the agreement with the customer have been met. Publishing and Domain: •	 Revenue from advertising for newspapers, magazines and other publications is recognised on  the publication date. •	 Revenue from the provision of advertising on websites is recognised over the period the  advertisements are placed. •	 Revenue from the provision of property listings is accounted for as a single performance  obligation, the provision of a listing being a distinct service. Revenue is recognised over the  listing period. Subscription revenue •	 Revenue from subscriptions for newspapers, magazines, other publications is recognised on the  publication date. •	 Revenue for digital subscriptions and Stan subscriptions is recognised over time. Affiliate revenue •	 Revenue from affiliates is recognised on a monthly basis based on a percentage of revenue  generated by the affiliate. Affiliate revenue relates to the Group’s entitlement to a percentage of  advertising revenue derived by broadcast partners, payable to the Group as consideration for  use of the Group’s program inventory. Circulation revenue •	 Revenue from circulation for newspapers, magazines and other publications is recognised on  the publication date. Program sales revenue •	 Revenue from program sales and recoveries, including syndicated programming content, is  recognised when it is broadcast or as the program content is distributed. Other revenue includes transactional and non-trading revenue, which is recognised when the services are performed, and  sublease income, which is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the operating lease.  Type of other income  Recognition Criteria Interest Recognised as the interest accrues using the effective interest method (which is the rate that exactly  discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the  net carrying amount of the financial asset). Dividends Recognised when the right to receive payment has been established.

The Group’s practice to date has been to  purchase the shares on the open market and if this practice continues there will be no difference between basic and diluted earnings per share. Accounting Policy Basic Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit/(loss) for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders  of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, as adjusted for shares held in Trust  (refer Note 4.2). Diluted Earnings Per Share Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit/(loss) attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent  by the sum of the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the number of ordinary shares that  would be issued on conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares (such as performance rights) into ordinary shares. 2. Group Performance continued 94 Nine Entertainment Co.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 99 ===== The ageing analysis of trade receivables not considered impaired is as follows: Past due but not impaired   Total Not past due <30 days 31-60 days >61 days 2023 395,571  340,985 23,701 4,529 26,356 2022 379,990   337,495   38,138  3,439  918  The ageing of trade receivables has deteriorated during the period following a change in the Group’s financial system which impacted  the issuance of invoices and statements to customers for a short period of time following implementation. This issue has been  remediated and the above aged trade receivables balances as at 30 June 2023 are not considered impaired.  Accounting Policy Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for expected credit loss. They are  non‑interest bearing and are generally on 30 to 60-day terms. Expected credit losses (ECLs) for trade receivables are initially recognised based on the Group’s historical observed default rates.  The Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but  instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix  that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic  environment. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking  estimates are analysed. Expected credit losses for individual trade receivables are recognised when there is an expectation that the Group will not be  able to collect all amounts due according to the original trade terms. Collectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing  basis. Individual debts that are known to be uncollectible are written off when identified. Factors considered as objective evidence  of impairment include ageing and timing of expected receipts and the creditworthiness of counterparties. The amount of the  impairment loss is the receivable carrying amount compared to the present value of estimated future cash flows. 3.3 Program rights and inventories 30 June 2023 $’000 30 June 2022 $’000 Current Program rights – cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment 266,262  260,419  Inventories  33,190   30,840  Total current program rights and inventories 299,452  291,259  Non-Current Program rights – cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment 156,470  168,236  Total non-current program rights and inventories 156,470  168,236  Annual Report 2023 97 Overview Corporate Governance Directors’ Report Operating and Financial Review Financial Statements Shareholder Information Corporate Directory  ===== PAGE 100 ===== Accounting Policy Program Rights The Group recognises program rights which are available for use. Programs which are available for use, including those acquired  overseas, are recorded at cost less amounts charged to the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income based  on the transmission and useful life of the content and management’s assessment of the future years of benefit, which is regularly  reviewed with additional write-downs made as considered necessary. Program rights are classified as current or non-current based on the expected realisation of economic benefits flowing from  their use. Inventories Inventories are carried at lower of cost or net realisable value (“NRV”). The NRV is the estimated future net cash inflows in the  ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Key judgements, estimates and assumptions The assessment of the appropriate carrying value of program rights and inventories requires estimation by management of the  forecast future cash flows which will be derived from that content. This estimate is based on a combination of market conditions  and the value generated from the broadcast of comparable programs. Due to the uncertainties in estimating forecast future cash flows, changes in economic and market conditions could result in  changes in the carrying value in future periods. 3.4 Trade and other payables 30 June 2023 $’000 30 June 2022 $’000 Current – unsecured   Trade and other payables 281,395 266,359  Program contract payables 162,605  163,693  Deferred income 87,943  76,952  Contingent consideration (Note 6.1) 653  23,101  Total current trade and other payables 532,596 530,105  Non-current – unsecured Program contract payables 94,081  111,034  Deferred income 2,800  4,476  Contingent consideration (Note 6.1) 10,539  10,701  Total non-current trade and other payables 107,420  126,211  3. Operating assets and liabilities continued 98 Nine Entertainment Co. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 101 ===== Accounting Policy Trade and other payables are carried at amortised cost. Liabilities are brought to account for amounts payable in relation to  goods received and services rendered, whether or not billed to the Group at reporting date. The Group operates in a number of  diverse markets, and accordingly the terms of trade vary by business. Terms of trade in relation to trade payables are, on average,  30 to 60 days from the date of invoice. Program contract payables are settled according to the contract negotiated with the  program supplier.  Deferred income represents the fair value of cash received for revenue relating to future periods. Contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer on business combinations is recognised at fair value at the acquisition  date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in accordance with AASB 9 Financial  Instruments in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income. Contingent consideration resulting  from business combinations is measured at the fair value of the Group’s best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the  present obligation at the reporting date. The determination of these fair values involves judgement around the forecast results of  those businesses. Key judgements, estimates and assumptions Contingent consideration from business combinations is valued at fair value on the acquisition date. When the contingent  consideration meets the definition of a financial liability, it is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date with revaluations  recognised within the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income. The contingent consideration  is accounted for in accordance with AASB 9 Financial Instruments and disclosed as a financial liability on the Consolidated  Statement of Financial Position. The determination of the fair value is based on discounted cashflows. The key assumptions include the probability and timing  of meeting commercial and financial performance targets and the discount factor. Management uses their best estimates of  future cash flows and other key assumptions to determine the appropriate fair value of contingent consideration on acquisition  and at each subsequent reporting period. Where appropriate, management obtained external expert advice for these key  assumptions and continues to seek further advice (where applicable) throughout the measurement period. Given the fair value  measurement was performed using significant non-observable inputs, the fair value was classified as a Level 3 measurement,  refer to Note 4.5(b)(i). IDS Group Management remeasure the contingent consideration at each reporting date based on any settlements made during the period  and its best estimates of key assumptions and future developments in business performance of the IDS Group.  In the year ended 30 June 2023, the first tranche of contingent consideration, totalling a $23.9 million cash outflow, was settled.  As at 30 June 2023, the contingent consideration was remeasured to $10.5 million discounted (30 June 2022: $32.3 million) and  $13.1 million undiscounted (30 June 2022: $36.7 million), with the resulting loss of $2.1 million being recorded in the Consolidated  Statement of Profit or Loss and disclosed as a specific item (refer to Note 2.4). At each reporting period, Management will continue to remeasure the contingent consideration based on the IDS Group securing  and delivering specified government contracts over the earn out period ending in June 2027. Realbase Group For the contingent consideration associated with the Realbase Group, at both acquisition and reporting date, Management  determined the fair value of the contingent consideration to be nil based on forecast projections of the business. At each  reporting period, Management will remeasure the contingent consideration based on the latest forecast financial performance of  the business. Due to the uncertainties in estimating fair value of contingent consideration, changes in commercial and financial performance of  the businesses could result in changes in the carrying value in future periods. Refer to Note 6.1 for further details.

Depreciation and amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows: •	 freehold buildings – 20 to 60 years •	 other production equipment – up to 15 years •	 leasehold improvements – lease term •	 right-of-use property – lease term •	 right-of-use plant and equipment – up to 6 years •	 plant and equipment – 2 to 15 years •	 computer equipment – up to 6 years. The assets’ residual values, useful lives and amortisation methods are reviewed and adjusted as appropriate each year end. Impairment The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances  indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and  value in use. The recoverable amounts are based on the present value of expected future cash flows. For an asset that does  not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which  the asset belongs. If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the  assets or cash-generating units are written down to their recoverable amount. Refer to Note 3.6 for details of CGU recoverable  amount assessment. Annual Report 2023 101 Overview Corporate Governance Directors’ Report Operating and Financial Review Financial Statements Shareholder Information Corporate Directory  ===== PAGE 104 ===== Accounting Policy continued Disposal An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no further future economic benefits are  expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the  difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item) is included in the Statement of Profit or Loss  and Other Comprehensive Income in the year the item is derecognised. Assets held for sale The Group classifies non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale or for distribution to equity holders of the parent  if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through sale or a distribution rather than through continuing use. Such  non‑current assets and disposals are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell or to  distribute. Costs to sell or distribute are the incremental costs directly attributable to the sale or distribution, excluding finance  costs and income tax expense. The criteria for held for sale or for distribution classification is regarded as met only when the sale or distribution is highly  probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale or distribution in its present condition. Management must  be committed to the sale or distribution expected within one year from the date of the classification. Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not depreciated or amortised once classified as held for sale or  distribution. Key judgements, estimates and assumptions The Group has applied certain judgements including which contractual arrangements represent a lease, the period over which the  lease exists, the variability of future cash flows and the applicable incremental borrowing rates used to calculate the lease liability  and related lease asset. 3. Operating assets and liabilities continued 102 Nine Entertainment Co.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 107 ===== 3.6(b) Determination of recoverable amount The recoverable amount of the CGUs is determined based on Value-in-use calculations using discounted cash flow projections based  on financial forecasts covering a five-year period with a terminal growth rate applied thereafter, with the exception of the Domain CGU  which is based on fair value less cost of disposal calculations (and which is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy) using  cash flow projections for up to ten years and a terminal growth rate applied thereafter. As at 30 June 2023, the Group determined Total TV, NBN, Stan, Domain, Metropolitan Media and Nine Radio and each of the  components of Other (Nine.com.au and Pedestrian TV) to be CGUs subject to an annual impairment test. The Group performed its annual impairment test in June 2023 for each CGU. The cash flow projections which are used in determining  any impairment require management to make significant estimates and judgements. Each of the assumptions is subject to significant  judgement about future economic conditions and the ongoing structure of markets in which the CGUs operate. Forecasted cashflows  are risk-adjusted allowing for estimated changes in the business, the competitive trading environment and potential changes in  customer behaviour. During the year to 30 June 2023, the ongoing demand for goods and services following the COVID-19 pandemic market recovery,  as well as supply constraints created by both the pandemic and current world events, has led to inflation in major economies globally.  This has lead to increased cash rates as central banks seek to return inflation to target, as well as macro economic uncertainty which  has impacted the majority of the markets in which Nine operate. Consequently, managements expectation of the impact of current  economic conditions have been incorporated when determining the recoverable amount of CGUs. 3.6(c) Impairment losses recognised As a result of impairment analysis performed at 30 June 2023, management identified an impairment in the Nine Radio CGU of  $84.5 million which reflects an increase in the discount rate applied to the CGU, as well as the estimated impact of the current macro- economic environment on future advertising revenue. As a result, radio licenses ($73.3 million), software ($0.8 million) and property,  plant and equipment ($10.4 million) have been impaired. This impairment charge is included within Expenses in the Statement of Profit  and Loss and Other Comprehensive Income, and has been disclosed as a specific item in Note 2.4. There is headroom in the Group’s  remaining CGUs. 3.6(d) Key assumptions Operating cash flow projections have been determined based on expectations of future performance, considering recent trading.  Significant assumptions used in the impairment testing are inherently subjective and in times of economic uncertainty the degree of  subjectivity is higher than it might otherwise be. Changes in certain assumptions can lead to significant changes in the recoverable  amount of these assets.  In the context of this uncertain environment, the Group has based its impairment testing upon conditions existing at 30 June 2023 and  what the Directors believe can reasonably be expected at that date. Key assumptions in the cash flows include revenue growth, cost of  sales and operating expenses. These assumptions take into account management’s expectations of market demand and operational  performance. The key assumptions on which management has based its cash flow projections when determining the value in use calculations for  each CGU are set out below. Management has applied its best estimates to each of these variables but cannot warrant their outcome. Total TV •	 The advertising market for metro FTA television reflects management’s expectation of single-digit decline in the short term to  medium term in line with market maturity and management’s expectations of market development. The advertising market for  broadcast video-on-demand is expected to exhibit double-digit growth over the short to medium term consistent with industry  market participant expectations. •	 Nine Network’s share of the Metro FTA, and 9Now’s share of the broadcast Video-on-Demand, advertising markets in future years is  estimated after consideration of recent audience performance in key demographics, revenue share performance and the impact of  investment in content. •	 Expenditure is assumed to show low single-digital growth over the life of the model, to support the forecast growth in revenue. •	 The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections was 14.91% (30 June 2022: 14.91%) which reflects current market  assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the relevant segments in which the CGU operates. •	 Terminal growth rate of 1.00% (30 June 2022: 1.00%). Annual Report 2023 105 Overview Corporate Governance Directors’ Report Operating and Financial Review Financial Statements Shareholder Information Corporate Directory  ===== PAGE 108 ===== Metropolitan Media: •	 Revenue is forecast to show slight growth in the medium term based on market maturity and is in line with industry trends and  management’s expectation of market development. •	 Expenditure is assumed to show low single-digital growth over the life of the model, to support the forecast growth in revenue. •	 The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections was 15.62% (30 June 2022: 14.99%) which reflects current market  assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the relevant segments in which the CGU operates. •	 Terminal growth rate of 0.0% (30 June 2022: 0.0%) consistent with industry forecasts specific to the CGU. Nine Radio: •	 Revenue is based on assumptions around linear and digital market growth and market share by station, considering past  performance and trends, and reflects management’s expectation of single-digit growth in the short to medium term. •	 Expenditure is assumed to increase over the life of the model, to support the forecast growth in revenue. •	 The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections was 16.65% (30 June 2022: 15.40%) which reflects current market  assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash flow projections applicable to the relevant licence. •	 Terminal growth rate of 1.5% (30 June 2022: 1.5%) consistent with industry forecasts specific to the CGU. Stan: •	 Revenue growth is in line with subscription video-on-demand business industry trends, taking account of recent investment in the  diversification of content. •	 Expenditure is assumed to increase over the life of the model, to support the forecast growth in revenue. •	 The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections was 15.23% (30 June 2022: 14.71%) which reflects current market  assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the Australian subscription video-on-demand market. •	 Terminal growth rate of 3.5% (30 June 2022: 3.5%) consistent with industry forecasts specific to the CGU. Domain: The key assumptions on which management has based its cash flow projections when determining the fair value less cost of disposal  calculations for Domain are as follows: •	 Revenue growth is in line with digital business industry trends, market maturity and management’s expectations of market  development. •	 Expenditure is assumed to increase over the life of the model, to support the forecast growth in revenue. •	 The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections was 14.75% (30 June 2022: 13.55%) which reflects current market  assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the relevant market in which the CGU operates. •	 Terminal growth rate of 2.5% (30 June 2022: 2.5%) consistent with industry forecasts specific to the CGU. NBN: •	 The advertising market for regional FTA television reflects management’s expectation of single-digit decline in the short term to  medium term in line with market maturity and management’s expectations of market development. •	 Expenditure is assumed to remain relatively flat over the life of the model. •	 The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections was 16.80% (30 June 2022: 15.50%) which reflects current market  assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the regional free-to-air television market. •	 Terminal growth rate of 0.0% (30 June 2022: 0.0%). Nine.com.au: •	 The digital platforms within this CGU are forecast to be challenged in line with market maturity and management’s expectations  of market development. •	 Expenditure is assumed to decline in line with revenue over the life of the model. •	 The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections was 17.12% (30 June 2022: 16.18%) which reflects current market  assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the digital display market. •	 Terminal growth rate of 0.0% (30 June 2022: 0.0%). 3. Operating assets and liabilities continued 106 Nine Entertainment Co. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 109 ===== Pedestrian TV: •	 The digital advertising market reflects management’s expectation of single-digit growth over the short to medium term in line with  digital business industry trends, market maturity and management’s expectations of market development. •	 Expenditure is assumed to increase over the life of the model, to support the forecast growth in revenue. •	 The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections was 15.10% (30 June 2022: 15.65%) which reflects current market  assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the digital display market. •	 Terminal growth rate of 2.0% (30 June 2022: 2.0%). For the purpose of impairment testing, intangible assets with indefinite lives, including goodwill, are allocated to the Group’s operating  divisions which represent the lowest level within the Group at which the assets are monitored for internal management purposes. 3.6(e) Sensitivity The estimated recoverable amounts of the CGUs represent Management’s assessment of future performance based on historical  performance and expected future economic and industry conditions. •	 The recoverable amount of the Total TV and NBN CGUs are in excess of the carrying amounts of intangible and tangible assets  of the respective CGUs. The excess is deemed to relate to previously impaired goodwill, which cannot be reversed according to  Australian Accounting Standards. Any reasonable adverse change in key assumptions would not lead to impairment. •	 The recoverable amount of the Stan, Domain, Metropolitan Media, Nine.com.au, PedestrianTV CGUs are in excess of the carrying  amounts of intangible and tangible assets of the respective CGUs. Any reasonable adverse change in key assumptions would not  lead to impairment. •	 The estimated recoverable amount of the Nine Radio CGU is equal to the carrying value, following the impairment charge noted  above. Any future event that results in adverse changes to forward assumptions would accordingly result in further impairment.  The following changes to the impairment assessment of this CGU are considered reasonably possible and would increase the  impairment charge, assuming all other assumptions are held constant, by the following amounts: Assumption ($ million) Nine Radio 2.50% reduction in forecast revenue growth per annum (21.7) 1.00% increase in the pre-tax discount rate (4.0) 1.00% reduction in the terminal growth rates (3.2) Together any adverse changes in the key assumptions would cumulatively result in a more significant additional impairment impact.  However, the sensitivity analysis does not take into consideration any steps which management would take to mitigate the impact of  these changes on the business. Accounting Policy Goodwill Goodwill on acquisition is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group’s  interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less  any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is not amortised. As at the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to each of the cash-generating units expected to benefit from the  combination’s synergies. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment, annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying  value may be impaired. Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the  goodwill relates. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss  is recognised. Annual Report 2023 107 Overview Corporate Governance Directors’ Report Operating and Financial Review Financial Statements Shareholder Information Corporate Directory  ===== PAGE 110 ===== Accounting Policy continued Licences Licences are carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. The Directors regularly assess the carrying value of licences  to ensure they are not carried at a value greater than their recoverable amount. No amortisation is provided against these assets  as the Directors consider that the licences are indefinite life intangible assets. Mastheads and Brand Names The Group’s mastheads and brand names operate in established markets with limited licence conditions and are expected to  continue to complement the Group’s new media initiatives. On this basis, the Directors have determined that the majority of  mastheads and brand names have indefinite useful lives as there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the assets are  expected to generate net cash inflows for the Group. These assets are not amortised but are tested for impairment annually. Customer Relationships Customer relationships purchased in a business combination are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, which  are between five and fifteen years. Other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost, and from a business combination are capitalised at fair value as at  the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, the cost model is applied to the class of intangible assets. Costs incurred to develop software for internal use and websites are capitalised and amortised over the estimated useful life  of the software or website. Costs related to design or maintenance of software for internal use and websites are expensed  as incurred. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) arrangements are arrangements in which the Group does not currently control the underlying  software used in the arrangement. Where expenditure relates to SaaS arrangements, an assessment is undertaken to determine  if this can be capitalised. Where costs incurred to configure or customise SaaS arrangements result in the creation of a resource  which is identifiable, and where the company has the power to obtain the future economic benefits flowing from the underlying  resource and to restrict the access of others to those benefits, such costs are recognised as a separate intangible software asset  and amortised over the useful life of the software on a straight-line basis. Only intangible assets with a finite life are amortised. Intangible assets are tested for impairment where an indicator of impairment exists, and annually in the case of indefinite  life intangibles, either individually or at the cash generating unit level. Useful lives are also examined on an annual basis and  adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis. Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal  proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive  Income when the asset is derecognised. Key judgements, estimates and assumptions The Group determines whether goodwill, and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, are impaired at least  on an annual basis. Other intangible assets are reviewed at least annually to determine whether any indicators of impairment exist,  and if necessary an impairment analysis is performed. Impairment testing requires an estimation of the recoverable amount of the  cash generating units to which the goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are allocated. Refer above for  key assumptions used. 3. Operating assets and liabilities continued 108 Nine Entertainment Co.

If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects the risks  specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a  borrowing cost. Annual Report 2023 109 Overview Corporate Governance Directors’ Report Operating and Financial Review Financial Statements Shareholder Information Corporate Directory  ===== PAGE 112 ===== Accounting Policy continued Employee entitlements Provision is made for employee benefits accumulated as a result of employees rendering services up to balance date including  related on-costs. The benefits include wages and salaries, incentives, compensated absences and other benefits, which are  charged against profits in their respective expense categories when services are provided or benefits vest with the employee. The provision for employee benefits is measured at the remuneration rates expected to be paid when the liability is settled.  Benefits expected to be settled after 12 months from the reporting date are measured at the present value of the estimated future  cash outflows to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. The liability for long service leave is recognised in the provision for employee benefits and measured as the present value of  expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date using the projected  unit credit method. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures, and years of service.  Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the reporting date on corporate bonds with terms to maturity and  currencies that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows. Onerous contracts The Group is carrying provision for onerous contracts (other than property contracts) where, due to changes in market conditions,  the expected benefit derived from the contract is lower than the committed contractual terms. Other Other provisions include: •	 Defamation, content and royalty provisions, estimated based on the expected costs to be incurred. •	 Disposal related provisions, including Events contra advertising, based on related disposal agreements. •	 Property leases, other than those accounted for in accordance with AASB 16, are considered to be an onerous contract if the  unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under  it. Where a decision has been made to vacate the premises or there is excess capacity and the lease is considered to be  onerous, a provision is recorded. •	 Amounts payable in connection with restructuring, including termination benefits, on-costs, outplacement and consultancy  services. Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date, or when an  employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits when  it is demonstrably committed to either terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal  plan without possibility of withdrawal or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary  redundancy. Key judgements, estimates and assumptions Onerous contract provisions The Group has recognised onerous contract provisions in relation to various content and property lease contracts where the cost  exceeds the economic benefit expected to be derived from the contract. Due to the uncertainties in estimating expected future  economic benefits, future actual performance may differ from the amounts provided. Defamation Provision The Group has recognised a defamation provision related to a number of ongoing claims and proceedings against the Group.  This provision is calculated based on Management’s best estimate of the costs expected to be incurred. Due to the uncertainties  inherent in estimating such claims and proceedings, the actual costs may differ from the amounts provided. 3. Operating assets and liabilities continued 110 Nine Entertainment Co.

The debt refinance was determined to be a substantial modification under  AASB Finance Instruments and as such all remaining capitalised borrowings costs related to the old facility, totalling $0.5 million,  were expensed during the year. At 30 June 2023, $426 million (30 June 2022: $260 million) of the syndicated facilities was drawn. A $33.3 million bank guarantee facility is also available to the Group’s 100% owned subsidiaries on a rolling annual basis. As of  30 June 2023, $24.0 million was drawn (30 June 2022: $28.6 million). The corporate facilities available to the Group for its 100% owned subsidiaries are provided by a syndicate of banks and financial  institutions. The interest rate for drawings under these facilities is the applicable bank bill rate plus a credit margin. These facilities are supported by guarantees from most of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries (refer to Note 6.3) but are  otherwise provided on an unsecured basis. These facilities impose various affirmative and negative covenants on the Company and  the Group, including restrictions on encumbrances, and customary events of default, including a payment default, breach of covenants,  cross-default and insolvency events. As part of the corporate facilities, the Group is subject to certain customary financial covenants measured on a six monthly basis.  The Group has been in compliance with its financial covenant requirements during the year ended 30 June 2023. Domain Domain Group is party to a $355.0 million syndicated bank facility which is available to a controlled entity, Domain Holdings Australia  Limited (Domain). This facility consists of tranches maturing in December 2025 ($215.0 million) and December 2026 ($140.0 million). The interest rate for drawings under this facility is the applicable bank bill rate plus a credit margin. At 30 June 2023, $220.0 million  (30 June 2022: $220.0 million) was drawn on this facility. Domain is subject to certain customary financial covenants measured on a six monthly basis. Domain has been in compliance with its  financial covenant requirements during the year ended 30 June 2023. Accounting Policy All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received net of incremental issue  costs associated with the borrowing. After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at  amortised costs using the effective interest method.

As at 30 June 2023, a total of 77,686,472 shares were purchased at an average price of $1.98 per share.  At 30 June 2023, a trust controlled by the Company held 4,037,680 (30 June 2022: 5,209,131) ordinary fully paid shares in the  Company. During the period, nil shares (2022: 4,561,562 shares) were acquired by the Trust. Shares are purchased for the purpose  of allowing the Group to satisfy performance rights obligations and short-term incentive obligations to certain senior management of  the Group. Terms and Conditions of Contributed Equity Ordinary shares entitle the holder to participate in dividends and the proceeds on winding up or sale of the Company in proportion to  the number of shares held. Accounting Policy Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Issued capital is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received by the Group, less  transaction costs. The Group provides remuneration to senior management in the form of share-based payments, whereby employees  render services as consideration for equity instruments. The transactions of these share-based payments are settled through a  plan trust and are treated as being executed by the Group (an external third party acts as the Group’s agent) in the Group’s financial  statements. Where shares to satisfy the Rights Plan are purchased by the plan trust, the consideration paid is deducted from total  shareholders’ equity and the shares are treated as treasury shares until they are subsequently vested, sold, reissued or cancelled.  Where such shares are vested, sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in shareholders’ equity. 4. Capital structure and management continued 114 Nine Entertainment Co.

Holdings Limited (“Nine”) paid an interim dividend of 6.0 cents per share, fully franked  (amounting to $100,182,690) in respect of the year ended 30 June 2023 and a dividend of 7.0 cents per share, fully franked (amounting  to $119,377,528) in respect of the year ended 30 June 2022. 4.3(b) Proposed Dividends on Ordinary Shares not recognised as a liability Since the year end, the Directors have proposed a dividend, fully franked of 5.0 cents per share amounting to $81,385,339 to be paid  in October 2023 (2022: fully franked dividend of 7.0 cents per share amounting to $119,377,528). 4.3(c) Franking credits available for subsequent years The franking credits available for subsequent years as at 30 June 2023 was $115,599,746 (2022: $74,315,049). This balance represents  the franking account balance as at 30 June 2023. After adjusting for franking credits which arise from the payment of income tax  payable balances as at the end of the financial year, the franking account balance is $118,322,092. Nine had an exempting account balance of $41,069,000 for the year ended 30 June 2023 (2022: $41,069,000). Nine became a  former exempting entity as a consequence of the IPO in December 2013. As a result, Nine’s franking account balance at that time was  transferred to an exempting account. Exempting credits will generally only be of benefit to certain foreign resident shareholders by  providing an exemption from Australian dividend withholding tax. The exempting credits will generally not give rise to a tax offset for  Australian resident shareholders. Accounting Policy A provision for dividends is not recognised as a liability unless the dividends are declared, determined or publicly recommended  on or before the reporting date.

Holdings Limited (“parent entity” or “NEC”), performance  rights (“NEC Rights”) have been granted to executives and other senior management who have an impact on the Group’s performance.  On satisfaction of vesting conditions, each NEC Right will convert to a share in the parent entity on a one-for-one basis or entitle the  Participant to receive cash to the value of a share. Details of the plan are included in the Remuneration Report on pages 56 to 75.  In addition, there are long-term incentive plans in Domain Group; further details of Domain Group’s employee share plans are detailed  in the Domain Group annual report for the year ended 30 June 2023. The total expense (pre tax) recognised for share based payments during the financial period for the Group was $6,414,875 (2022:  $12,044,764), of which $2,449,392 (2022: $7,998,247) relates to Domain Group. The share based payments reserve includes amounts  relating to on-foot schemes of Domain Group totalling $10.7 million (2022: $13.6 million).

This includes  450,797 (2022: 496,266) NEC Rights in relation to executives that left in prior years which were cash settled. During the period ended 30 June 2023, the Group awarded 581,329 shares (2022: 517,083) to senior management as part payment of  their short-term incentives for the year ended 30 June 2023. An expense of $1,230,682 was recognised in respect of these incentives  in the prior period (2022: $1,517,477). Accounting Policy The Group provides remuneration to senior management in the form of share-based payments, whereby employees render  services as consideration for equity instruments (equity-settled transactions). The cost for equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the date when the grant is made using an appropriate  valuation model. That cost is recognised in employee benefit expense, together with a corresponding increase in share-based  payment reserves, over the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled. The cumulative expense  recognised at each reporting date, until vesting date, reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired. The share-based  payments can be settled with either cash or equity at the election of the Group. Where terms of an individual’s share-based payment are modified to settle in cash, the cumulative expense is transferred from the  share-based payment reserve to Payables in the Statement of Financial Position. 4. Capital structure and management continued 116 Nine Entertainment Co.

The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage liquidity and to raise finance for the Group’s  operations. The Group has various other financial instruments, such as trade and other receivables and trade and other payables,  which arise directly from its operations. The Group uses derivatives in accordance with Board approved policies to reduce the Group’s exposure to adverse fluctuations in  interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Derivative instruments that the Group uses to hedge risks such as interest rate, foreign  currency, and commodity price movements include: •	 interest rate swaps; and •	 forward foreign currency contracts. The Group’s risk management activities are carried out centrally, under policies approved by the Board, in cooperation with the  Group’s operating units so as to maximise the benefits associated with centralised management of Group risk factors. 4.5(b) Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the  return to shareholders through the optimisation of net debt and total equity balances. Capital risk management focuses on the maturity profile and stability of debt facilities. The Group’s capital structure is reviewed  to maintain: •	 sufficient finance for the business at a reasonable cost; •	 sufficient funds available to the business to implement its capital expenditure and business acquisition strategies; and •	 compliance with all financial covenants. Where excess funds arise with respect to the funds required to enact the Group’s business strategies, consideration is given to  repayment of debt, increased dividends or buy back of shareholder equity. 4.5(b)(i) Carrying value and Fair Values of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The carrying value of a financial asset or liability will approximate its fair value where the balances are predominantly short-term in  nature, can be traded in highly liquid markets, and incur little or no transaction costs. The carrying values of the following accounts approximate their fair value: Account Note Cash and cash equivalents 3.1 Trade and other receivables 3.2 Trade and other payables 3.4 The Group uses various methods in estimating the fair value of a financial asset or liability. The different methods have been defined  as follows: Level 1:	 The fair value is calculated using quoted prices in active markets. Level 2:	 The fair value is estimated using inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or  liability, through valuation techniques including forward pricing and swap models and using present value calculations.  The models incorporate various inputs including credit quality of counterparties and foreign exchange spot rates, forward  rates and listed share prices. Fair values of the Group’s financial liabilities are determined by using a DCF method and a  discount rate that reflects the issuer’s borrowing rate as at the end of the reporting period. Level 3:	 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable. The fair values hierarchy has been determined as follows for financial assets and financial liabilities of the Group at 30 June 2023: Level 1:	 Investment in listed equities (Note 7.1). Level 2:	 Forward foreign exchange contracts and financial liabilities (Note 4.1). Level 3:	 Unlisted shares, CGU recoverable amount for Domain (Note 3.6(a)) and contingent consideration (Note 3.4).

Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of the Group’s financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in  market prices. The market risk factors to which the Group is exposed are discussed in further detail below. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group cannot meet its financial commitments as and when they fall due. To help reduce this risk, the  Group ensures it has readily accessible funding arrangements available. The contractual maturity of the Group’s financial assets and other financial liabilities are shown in the following tables. The amounts  presented represent the future undiscounted principal and interest cash flows and therefore do not equate to the values shown in the  Statement of Financial Position. 4. Capital structure and management continued 118 Nine Entertainment Co.

For floating rate instruments, the amount disclosed is determined by reference to the interest rate at the last repricing date. 2.	 This assumes the amount drawn down at 30 June 2023 remains drawn until the facilities mature. Interest rate risk Interest rate risk refers to the risks that the value of a financial instrument or cash flows associated with the instrument will fluctuate due  to changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risk arises from interest-bearing financial assets and liabilities that the Group utilises.  Non-derivative interest bearing assets are predominantly cash. The Group’s debt facilities are all floating rate liabilities, which gives rise  to cash flow interest rate risks. The Group’s risk management policy for interest rate risk seeks to minimise the effects of interest rate movements on its asset and  liability portfolio through active management of the exposures. The Group maintains a mix of long-term and short-term debt to manage these risks as deemed appropriate. The Group designates  which of its financial assets and financial liabilities are exposed to a fair value or cash flow interest rate risk, such as financial assets  and liabilities with a fixed rate or financial assets and liabilities with a floating rate that is reset as market rates change.

Assuming the closing debt outstanding, with all other variables held  constant, the Group’s profit before tax is affected through the impact on floating rate borrowings as follows: Effect on profit before tax Increase/decrease  in basis points 2023  $’000 2022  $’000 AUD +/-100  (6,460) / 6,460   (4,800) / 4,800  AUD  +/-200  (12,920) / 12,920   (9,600) / 9,600  The maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying amount of current receivables. For those non-current receivables, the maximum  exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying amount of each class of receivables. Collateral is not held as security. Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes  in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to contractual  payments for program rights in USD and EUR, and contractual receipts in USD. These transactions are highly probable. The Group manages this foreign currency risk by entering into forward foreign exchange contracts. The foreign exchange forward  contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and are entered into for periods consistent with the foreign currency exposure of the  underlying transactions. The foreign exchange forward contract balances vary with the level of expected foreign currency receipts and payments, and changes  in foreign exchange forward rates. 4. Capital structure and management continued 120 Nine Entertainment Co.

The Group has exposure to credit risk on all financial assets included in the Group’s Statement of Financial  Position. To help manage this risk, the Group: •	 has a policy for establishing credit limits; and •	 manages exposures to individual entities it either transacts with or with which it enters into derivative contracts (through a system  of credit limits). The Group’s credit risk is mainly concentrated across a number of customers and financial institutions. The Group does not have any  significant credit risk exposure to a single customer or group of customers, or individual institutions. Refer to Note 3.2 for details on the  Group’s policy on impairment, its ageing analysis of trade receivables and the allowance for expected credit losses. Accounting Policy The Group uses derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps and foreign currency contracts, to hedge its risks  associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations. Such derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value on the date the instrument is entered into and are  subsequently remeasured at fair value or ‘mark to market’ at each reporting date. The gain or loss on remeasurement is  recognised immediately in profit or loss unless the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, in which case the  remeasurement is recognised in equity. Hedge accounting Hedges are classified as fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or  liability, or cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk  associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecasted transaction. At inception of the hedge relationship, the Group formally designates the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged  items, as well as its risk management objective for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Group also documents its  assessment at hedge inception date, and on an ongoing basis, as to whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions  have been and will continue to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. The Group enters into hedge relationships where the critical terms of the hedging instrument are closely aligned with the terms of  the hedged item and a qualitative assessment is performed to assess effectiveness. If changes in circumstances affect the terms  of the hedged item, such as the terms are no longer closely aligned with the critical terms of the hedged instrument, a hypothetical  derivative method is used to assess effectiveness. Cash flow hedge A derivative or financial instrument hedging the exposure to variability in cash flows attributable to a particular risk associated  with an asset, liability or forecasted transaction. A cash flow hedge is used to swap variable interest rate payments to fixed interest  rate payments, or to lock in foreign currency rates in order to manage the Group’s exposure to interest rate risk and foreign  exchange risk. The effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income and  accumulated in equity in the cash flow hedge reserve. The change in the fair value that is identified as ineffective is recognised  immediately in profit or loss within other income or other expense. Amounts accumulated in equity are transferred to profit or loss  when the hedged item affects profit or loss. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting,  any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is  ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that  was reported in equity is immediately transferred to profit or loss. For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken to the  profit and loss. 4. Capital structure and management continued 122 Nine Entertainment Co.

Annual Report 2023 123 Overview Corporate Governance Directors’ Report Operating and Financial Review Financial Statements Shareholder Information Corporate Directory  ===== PAGE 126 ===== Accounting Policy Current tax liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be paid to the taxation authorities based on the current year’s  taxable income. The tax rules and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted at the balance date. Deferred income tax is provided on all temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities  and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences: •	 except where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not  a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; or •	 in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint  ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the  temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and  unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary  differences, and the carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses, can be utilised except: •	 where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of  an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the  accounting profit not taxable profit or loss; or •	 in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint  ventures, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in  the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no  longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset  is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the  reporting date. Income taxes relating to items recognised directly in equity are recognised in other comprehensive income and not in the profit or  loss for the year. Tax consolidation Nine Entertainment Co. Holdings Limited (the “Company” or “Parent Entity”) and its 100% owned Australian subsidiaries  (collectively, the “Group”) are part of a tax consolidated group. As a result, members of the Group have entered into a tax  sharing arrangement in order to allocate income tax expense to the wholly-owned subsidiaries on a pro-rata basis. In addition,  the agreement provides for the allocation of income tax liabilities between the entities should the head entity default on its  tax obligations. At the balance date, the possibility of default is remote. The head entity of the tax consolidated group is Nine  Entertainment Co. Holdings Limited. The Company has recognised the current tax liability of the tax consolidated group. Members of the tax consolidated group are part of a tax funding agreement. The tax funding agreement provides for the  allocation of current and deferred taxes to members of the tax consolidated group in accordance with their taxable income for  the year. The allocation of taxes under the tax funding agreement is recognised as an increase/decrease in the subsidiaries’  intercompany accounts with the head entity. The Group has applied the group allocation approach to determine the appropriate  amount of current and deferred tax to allocate to each member of the tax consolidated group. 5. Taxation continued 124 Nine Entertainment Co. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 127 ===== Accounting Policy continued Other taxes Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of GST except: •	 where the GST incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the  GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable; and •	 receivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included. The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the  Statement of Financial Position. Cash flows are included in the Statement of Cash Flows on a gross basis and the GST components of cash flows arising from  investing and financing activities, which are recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority, are classified as operating  cash flows. Commitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation  authority.

The acquisition marked another step forward in  executing on Domain’s marketplace strategy to expand its addressable market beyond Agents and Consumers to financial institutions  and Government. The acquisition of IDS Group establishes Domain as a market leading provider of land and property valuation,  insights and analytics services into the Government sector, and significantly expands the size of the Property Data Solutions pillar  of Domain’s marketplace strategy. After reporting a provisional balance sheet at 30 June 2022, the purchase price allocation was finalised during the period.  This resulted in a reduction of goodwill from $82.4 million to $51.4 million, and recognition of $31.0 million of other assets and liabilities.  Goodwill recognised comprises expected synergies arising from the acquisition. None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be  deductible for income tax purposes. The Group has now finalised determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired as part  of the acquisition of the IDS Group. The consideration of the acquisition comprises an upfront cash payment and multiple tranches that are contingent on the future  financial and commercial performance of the IDS Group, relating to securing and delivering services under new customer contracts  over the performance period ending in June 2027. The first tranche cash payment of $54.7 million was settled on 15 October 2021. In the current year, IDS made progress in the  government market, winning the contract to supply the Western Australia (WA) Land Information Authority (which values all properties  in WA). The second tranche cash payment of $23.9 million associated with the WA contract was settled on 9 May 2023. Other tranches  are due to be settled during the performance period between completion and June 2027. The on-target and maximum consideration for the transaction, including the undiscounted contingent consideration, is $134.1 million  and $153.1 million respectively. The range of potential outcomes, undiscounted, is $78.0 million to $153.0 million. The expectation at  acquisition is that it will be cash settled, however, the purchase agreement allows for this consideration to be settled in cash and/or  equity at Domain’s discretion. As at the acquisition date, the discounted fair value of the contingent consideration was estimated to be $24.5 million. The fair value  of the contingent consideration determined at the date of acquisition reflects the probabilities of securing certain new government  contracts and achieving budgeted financial targets. Subsequent to the acquisition date, these assumptions have been revised as a  result of change in facts and circumstances post acquisition, resulting in the remeasurement of the contingent consideration. Refer to  key judgements, estimates and assumptions in Note 3.4 for adjustments recognized to the IDS contingent consideration in the period. Acquisition of Realbase Group On 29 April 2022, Australian Property Monitors Pty Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Domain Group, acquired 100% of the share  capital in Realbase Pty Ltd and its subsidiaries (Realbase Group). The acquisition marked another step forward in the evolution of  Domain’s Marketplace strategy. The acquisition of the Realbase Group is highly strategic, meaningfully accelerating the scale and  impact of Domain’s Agent Solutions business unit, with complementary offerings that create a holistic end-to-end solution for real  estate agents. After reporting a provisional balance sheet at 30 June 2022, management finalised the purchase price allocation during the period.  This resulted in a reduction of goodwill from $177.7 million to $140.7 million, and recognition of $37.0 million of other assets and  liabilities. Goodwill recognised comprises expected synergies arising from the acquisition and none of the goodwill recognised is  expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.  The consideration for the acquisition comprises an upfront cash payment and multiple tranches that are contingent upon the future  financial performance of the Realbase Group, specifically the achievement of stretch financial performance targets based on a mix of  revenue and EBITDA metrics over a three-year period of financial years ending 30 June 2024 to 30 June 2026. As at the acquisition  date and at 30 June 2023, Management determined the fair value of the contingent consideration to be nil based on forecast  projections of the business. The first tranche cash payment of $173.9 million was settled on 29 April 2022. Subsequently, the completion statement was finalised  resulting in a purchase price reduction amounting to $1.1 million. The on-target and maximum consideration for the transaction is $195.9 million and $220.9 million respectively. The range of potential  outcomes, undiscounted, is $170.9 million to $220.9 million. The expectation at acquisition is that any contingent consideration payable  will be cash settled, however, the purchase agreement allows for this to be settled in cash and/or equity at Domain’s discretion. 6. Group structure continued 128 Nine Entertainment Co. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 131 ===== Disposals There were no disposals for the year-ended 30 June 2023 (30 June 2022: none). Domain Group made the decision to exit the Domain Home Loans (DHL) business. As a result, DHL is being held for sale and therefore  DHL’s assets and liabilities are separately disclosed in the Statement of Financial Position. Accounting Policy The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations regardless of whether equity instruments  or other assets are acquired. Consideration is measured as the fair value of the assets given, shares issued or liabilities incurred or  assumed at the acquisition date. Where equity instruments are issued in a business combination, the fair value of the instruments  is their published price at the acquisition date unless, in rare circumstances, it can be demonstrated that the published price at  the acquisition date is an unreliable indicator of fair value and that other evidence and valuation methods provide a more reliable  measure of fair value. Transaction costs arising on the issue of equity instruments by the parent are recognised directly in equity. Except for non-current assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale (which are measured at fair value less costs to sell),  all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the  acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. The excess of the cost of the business combination over  the net fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is  less than the Group’s share of the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the subsidiary, the difference is recognised as a gain  in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, but only after a reassessment of the identification and measurement of the net assets  acquired. Where settlement of any part of the consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present  value as at the acquisition date at the original effective interest rate. Key judgements, estimates and assumptions The Group recognises the provisional fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, including goodwill, at values based  on information available to management as at balance date. These provisional values are applied as the initial accounting for the  business combinations are incomplete as at the end of the reporting period. The provisional values may be adjusted during the  measurement period (up to one year following acquisition) to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances  that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date. Therefore, the  finalisation of the purchase price allocation exercise may result in a change to the value of identified assets and liabilities recorded  as at balance date. Contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer on business combinations is recognised at fair value. Subsequent  changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in accordance with AASB 9 Financial Instruments in  the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income. The determination of these fair values involves  judgement around the forecast results of those businesses.

Annual Report 2023 131 Overview Corporate Governance Directors’ Report Operating and Financial Review Financial Statements Shareholder Information Corporate Directory  ===== PAGE 134 ===== Accounting Policy Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence and which are not subsidiaries. Significant influence  is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity but is not control or joint control over  those policies. A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net  assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when  decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The investments in the associate or joint venture are accounted for using the equity method. They are carried in the Consolidated  Statement of Financial Position at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associates, less  any impairment. Goodwill relating to the associate or joint venture is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is  neither amortised nor individually tested for impairment. The consolidated Statement of Consolidated Profit or Loss and Other  Comprehensive Income reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations of the associates or joint ventures. Dividends  received from associates and joint ventures are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as a reduction in  the carrying amount of the investment.  When the Group’s share of losses in the associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its investment in the associate or joint  venture, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the  associate or joint venture.  Any realised or unrealised gains and losses relating to transactions between the Group and the associate or joint venture are  eliminated against the investment accounted for using the equity method. The financial statements of the associate or joint venture are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. When  necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group. Impairment After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an impairment loss on its  investment in its associate or joint venture. At each reporting date, the Group performs an impairment test to determine whether  there is objective evidence that the investment in the associate or joint venture is impaired. If there is such evidence, the Group  calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate or joint venture and its  carrying value, then recognizes the loss as “Share of profit of an associate” in the Statement of Consolidated Profit or Loss and  Other Comprehensive Income. 6. Group structure continued 132 Nine Entertainment Co.

Accounting Policy Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the parent entity and its subsidiaries as at 30 June  2023. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and  has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Controlled entities are de-consolidated from the date  control ceases. Subsidiary acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The financial statements of subsidiaries  are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent entity, using consistent accounting policies. Adjustments are made to  bring into line any dissimilar accounting policies that may exist. All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised  profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated in full. Unrealised losses are eliminated unless costs cannot  be recovered. Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or  Loss and Other Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and Consolidated Statement of Financial  Position respectively. 6. Group structure continued 136 Nine Entertainment Co.

These investments are carried at fair value through Other Comprehensive Income  in order to avoid volatility in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 2023 $’000 2022 $’000 Non-current     As at 1 July 6,511  6,690  Movement in fair value  (1,985) (179) Closing balance at 30 June 4,526 6,511 The investment in listed equities is classified as a Level 1 instrument as described in Note 4.5(b). Fair value was determined with  reference to a quoted market price with a mark to market loss of $1,985,000 adjusted against the investment for the year ended  30 June 2023 (2022: $179,000 loss). Accounting Policy Certain of the Group’s investments are categorised as investments in listed equities and designated at fair value through other  comprehensive income, under AASB 9 Financial Instruments. When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at  fair value plus, in the case of assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. Recognition and derecognition All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date (i.e. the date that the Group commits to  purchase or sell the asset). Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets under contracts that require  delivery of the assets within the period established generally by regulation or convention in the market place. Financial assets are  derecognised when the right to receive cash flows from the financial assets has expired or when the entity transfers substantially  all the risks and rewards of the financial assets. If the entity neither retains nor transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards, it  derecognises the asset if it has transferred control of the assets. Subsequent Measurement Investments in listed equities are non-derivative financial assets, principally equity securities, which meet the definition of equity  instruments. Upon initial recognition under AASB 9, the Group made an irrevocable election, on an instrument-by-instrument basis,  to present subsequent changes in the fair value of its investments in listed equities in a separate component of equity. Gains and  losses on these financial assets are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are recognised as other income in the statement  of profit or loss when the right of payment has been established, except when the Group benefits from such proceeds as a  recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI).  Equity instruments designated at fair value through OCI are not subject to impairment assessment. The fair values of investments that are actively traded in organised financial markets are determined by reference to quoted  market bid prices at the close of business on the reporting date. For investments with no active market, fair values are determined  using valuation techniques. Such techniques include: using recent arm’s length market transactions; reference to the current  market value of another instrument that is substantially the same; and discounted cash flow analysis, making as much use of  available and supportable market data as possible and keeping judgemental inputs to a minimum. 142 Nine Entertainment Co. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 145 ===== 7.2 Defined benefit plan 2023 $’000 2022 $’000 Non-current Defined benefits plan1  24,149  23,925  Closing balance at 30 June  24,149  23,925  1.	 30 June 2023 balance consists of Nine Network Superannuation Plan (2023: $21,545,000; 2022: $21,521,000), Fairfax Media Super defined benefit plan (2023: $2,228,000;  2022: $2,058,000) and Nine Radio Pty Ltd Super defined benefit plan (2023: $376,000; 2022: $346,000). Plan information Defined benefit members receive lump sum benefits on retirement, death, disablement and withdrawal. The defined benefit sections  of the Plans are closed to new members. All new members receive accumulation only benefits. Regulatory framework The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) (SIS) legislation governs the superannuation industry and provides the framework within  which superannuation plans operate. The SIS Regulations require an actuarial valuation to be performed for each defined benefit  superannuation plan every three years, or every year if the plan pays defined benefit pensions unless an exemption has been  obtained. Responsibilities for the governance of the Plans The Plans’ Trustee is responsible for the governance of the Plans. The Trustee has a legal obligation to act solely in the best interests  of Plan beneficiaries. The Trustee has the following roles: •	 administration of the Plan and payment to the beneficiaries from Plan assets when required in accordance with Plan rules; •	 management and investment of the Plan assets; and •	 compliance with superannuation law and other applicable regulations. The prudential regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), licenses and supervises regulated superannuation plans. Risks There are a number of risks to which the Plans expose the Company. The more significant risks relating to the defined benefits are: •	 Investment risk – the risk that investment returns will be lower than assumed and the Company will need to increase contributions  to offset this shortfall; •	 Salary growth risk – the risk that wages or salaries (on which future benefit amounts will be based) will rise more rapidly than  assumed, increasing defined benefit amounts and thereby requiring additional employer contributions; and •	 Legislative risk – the risk that legislative changes could be made which could increase the cost of providing the defined benefits. The defined benefit assets of the Nine Network superannuation plan are invested in the AMP Future Directions Balanced investment  option. The assets have a 55% weighting to equities and therefore the Plan has a significant concentration of equity market risk.  However, within the equity investments, the allocation both globally and across sectors is diversified.  Significant events There were no Plan amendments affecting the defined benefits payable, curtailments or settlements during the year.

Asset-liability matching strategies No asset and liability matching strategies have been adopted by the Plan. Funding arrangements The financing objective adopted at the 1 July 2021 actuarial investigation of the Plan, in a report dated 21 December 2021, is to maintain  the value of the Plan’s assets at least equal to: •	 100% of accumulation account balances (including additional accumulation accounts of defined benefit members); plus •	 110% of defined benefit Vested Benefits. In that valuation, it was recommended that the Company contributes to the Plan as follows: •	 Defined Benefit members: Category Employer Contributions  Rate (% of Salaries) A  nil A1  nil  Plus any compulsory or voluntary member pre-tax (salary sacrifice) contributions. Accumulation members: •	 the Superannuation Guarantee (SG) rate of Ordinary Time Earnings (or such lesser amount as required to meet the Employer’s  obligations under Superannuation Guarantee legislation or employment agreements); •	 except that one year of required Employer SG Contributions (not exceeding $1 million per month or $12 million in aggregate, gross  of tax) may be financed from Defined Benefit Assets from 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 (or starting at a date as agreed between  the Trustee and the Employer). During the year to 30 June 2023, contributions of $nil (2022: $nil) were financed from defined  benefit assets; and •	 any additional employer contributions agreed between the Employer and a member (e.g. additional salary sacrifice contributions).

The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit  credit actuarial valuation method. Re-measurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling (excluding net interest) and the return on  plan assets (excluding net interest), are recognised immediately in the Statement of Financial Position with a corresponding debit  or credit to a separate component of equity in the period in which they occur. Re-measurements are not reclassified to profit or  loss in subsequent periods. Past service costs are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income on the earlier of the date of the plan amendment or  curtailment, and the date that the Group recognises restructuring-related costs. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. The Group recognises the  following changes in the net defined benefit obligation under “expenses” in the Statement of Comprehensive Income (by function): •	 service costs comprising current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and non-routine  settlements; and	 •	 net interest expense or income.
