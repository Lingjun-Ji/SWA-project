Establishing  a  fully Australian  owned company that would  accelerate the supply of  commercial EV’s here, means not  only can we better adapt our  core industries but the jobs and  economic impact remain here.  Our key industries like energy,  resources and transport are  looking for better solutions when it comes to vehicles.   We knew we could provide a  product that is not only built tough  for our terrain but would help  lower emissions and future proof  the nation - and we have.

Identified a gap in the  market & started importing  vehicles from the US and  outsourced right-hand  drive (RHD) conversions.  This allowed for more  efficient production and  compliance with Australian  regulations.  When businesses carry the Australian Owned  Certification, they actively contribute to the  nation’s economy by keeping profits, jobs,  and investments within Australia.   This boosts economic resilience, fosters local  entrepreneurship, and enhances national  self-sufficiency. Supporting Australian-owned  businesses means reducing reliance on  overseas supply chains and safeguarding  jobs, particularly in times of global economic  uncertainty. IMPORTING 2012 Brought manufacturing  operations in-house and  expanded capabilities.   We also launched our  vehicle certification services  to ensure compliance was  within the National industry  standards.

The implementation of EV Utes is not a leap  of faith, more an evolution of the way we  think at MPK and taking advantage of new technology as it’s developed.   It was a no brainer really – if we can take diesel vehicles off the road then that  goes some way in reducing our carbon emissions immediately. Adam Machon CEO MPK Kinetic What our  customers  say....  ===== PAGE 8 ===== We’re part of the solution  to roll out  renewable  energy in  Australia. Energy is  Changing 14 Energy Making an impact. Vestas has started a journey  of transitioning their service  vehicle fleet to electric (EVs)  or sustainably fuelled vehi­ cles.

Humanitarian support Our team worked with the regulators in  Samoa to design and deliver a vehicle to home  & vehicle to load system on a RHD Ford F-150  Lightning.  Due to the unreliability of the power grid in  Samoa they needed a 5kw exportable power  supply. The F150 has up to 130kw hours so  was the ideal solution as mobile power plant.  Not only was our product able to suit their  needs, it fully complies with local regulations  and means they no longer have to worry about  frequent blackouts.  This has been a game changer supporting  these communities and shows the potential of  use throughout the world. 20 Pipeline CURRENT CUSTOMERS Domestic &  International markets  We’re operating Australia wide.
