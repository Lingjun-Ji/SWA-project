We are experiencing extreme climate fluctuations, with global average temperatures continuing to record historical highs. Heightened geopolitical tensions and the increased threat of cyber-attacks are having major impacts on society and economic activity. On one hand, technology continues to advance, with the dramatic evolution of AI technology, in particular, signalling potential major changes in our world. AI adoption is a source of innovation for business and society, while at the same time the challenges such as ethical issues and increased power consumption are causing concern. We are modelling the future, which is being shaped by a complex interaction of dramatically evolving technology and the increasingly significant issue of sustabinability. In this era of increasing multifaceted and complex challenges, companies have a responsibility to create value using innovative approaches, and to contribute to the realization of a sustainable future. The Fujitsu Group states Our Purpose, which is “to make the world more sustainable by building trust in society through innovation”, with our vision for 2030 to be a technology company that achieves a net positive contribution through digital services. We have resolved and committed to our mission to make a positive impact on society that is greater than the negative impact of our corporate activity, through initiatives to drive technology to the three areas of Materiality we identified as our essential contributions: solving global environmental issues, developing a digital society, and improving people's well-being. Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 2-1 @Fujitsu 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 4 ===== In order to realize this vision, the Fujitsu Group is making efforts to solve various sustainability issues through Materiality initiatives. One example is our work towards solving global environmental issues through our goals to reduce carbon emissions across the Group to zero by FY2030, and to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the value chain by fiscal 2040. Referring to Group initiatives, we also offer our customers services and solutions that support the visualization and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the introduction of renewable energy. Further, in the area of Improved Human Well-being, we are actively creating an environment that provides autonomy to individual employees to establish flexible workstyles and make use of programs that support the upskilling that will realize their employee career plan, thus permitting the Group’s diverse human resources to build their own careers while utilizing their abilities to the maximum extent possible. As well, we are contributing to the construction of a healthy and secure digital society, with structures and guidelines that protect the digital assets of the customers and society from attacks, via stronger cyber security technology, and minimize the impact of the negative aspects of AI and other technology. To solve these issues, co-creation with our customers, our partners and across the entire society is essential. Through Fujitsu Uvance(*1) , our business model for the achievement of a sustainable world, we are accelerating our efforts in partnership with stakeholders, in approaches that go beyond regional and industry boundaries. Finally, the Fujitsu Group is a signatory to the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact and we continue our tireless efforts to make them a reality. We are committed to joining hands with global stakeholders to create a sustainable future through the power of technology. *1 For details on Fujitsu Uvance, see here.

In response to changes in society and the business environment, the company revised the philosophy in 2008 to further instill awareness in its people working around the globe. With the world becoming more closely interconnected, fast-changing and uncertain, and with various threats to global sustainability emerging, the Fujitsu Group renewed the Fujitsu Way in 2020. The goal was to use technology to deliver value for customers and contribute proactively to the transformation of society. Accordingly, we set out Our Purpose, which is “to make the world more sustainable by building trust in society through innovation”. The Fujitsu Way comprises three parts: Our Values represent an action cycle consisting of Aspiration, Trust and Empathy, which is necessary to achieve Our Purpose. As members of society, our employees will comply with the Code of Conduct. We aim to achieve Our Purpose by engaging in corporate activities that are based on the Fujitsu Way and that underpin the actions of each person in the Group. Click below for further details.

All Fujitsu employees work to achieve Our Purpose in their daily activities, while keeping in mind Our Values (Aspiration, Trust, and Empathy) and the Code of Conduct as they deliver value to customers and society. Activities to Promote the Fujitsu Way In-house Communication Initiatives Fujitsu has been deploying in-house communication initiatives to boost the degree of empathy with the Fujitsu Way. To promote the Fujitsu Way globally, we have appointed Fujitsu Way promotion leaders as part of the corporate governance structure. These individuals are responsible for promoting the Fujitsu Way on the front lines, and they participate in regular Fujitsu Way Meetings with the CEO as a way of spurring motivation. Fujitsu Way Our Story Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 3-2-1 @Fujitsu 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 8 ===== We have also produced a Fujitsu Way booklet and shared it with employees worldwide to ensure that each and every Fujitsu employee understands the Fujitsu Way and makes it their own. The booklet incorporates management's thinking on ways to implement change in Fujitsu. It also includes the words of former CEOs and other pioneers plus the background to their messages, which today form the company's DNA, embedded in the Fujitsu Way. We will continue to communicate the Fujitsu Way through workshops and videos, to ensure that all employees engage in the Fujitsu Way and work toward achieving Our Purpose. Broadening the Message through Purpose Carving® In 2020, with the need to coalesce the ideas of each and every employee to generate greater synergy and achieve Our Purpose, we started rolling out the Purpose Carving® program (*1), an initiative to shape and inform each individual's own purpose (My Purpose). Purpose Carving® is an interactive program that enables participants to reflect on their personal journeys and values, carving out their own purpose as they contemplate the future. With 82,000 employees worldwide having completed the program as of August 2024, the overlaying of their purposes on Fujitsu's corporate Purpose provides the driving force for transformation. *1 Purpose Carving® was selected as the winner of the Excellence Award in the Corporate HR category of HR Award 2022 (sponsored by the HR Award Steering Committee and supported by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare).

To create the type of sustainable society that Fujitsu envisions, it is important that the entire organization, based on its purpose and business strategy, places emphasis on contributing to a sustainable society through business and synchronizes business with sustainability. Materiality, revised in 2023, incorporates the perspective of delivering value to customers and society through our business activities. General Judges recruited from within the Fujitsu Group, Fujitsu Way promotion leaders, and the CSSO (*2) serve as judges; they base their decisions on the extent to which the entries embody the values and purpose reflected in the Fujitsu Way and the level of contribution to materiality and business.

Reflecting the newly established materiality, our vision for 2030 is to be “a technology company that realizes net positive(*1) through digital services''.Our value creation model is based on capital inputs and business activities that aim to create a sustainable society by focusing on key strategies for Fujitsu and to develop the priority issues for sustainability management under the Global Responsible Business (GRB) framework. The outputs derived from these initiatives are positioned as financial and non-financial indicators, and the resulting outcomes provide value to society in the form of impact indicators.We will continue to invest as inputs the various outputs and outcomes generated through these activities, while also working to enhance the value delivered to a range of stakeholders. (*1) Fujitsu defines net positive as follows: “In addition to maximizing financial returns, we are committed to solving global environmental problems, developing a digital society, and improving people’s well- being. Technology and innovation will have a positive impact on society as a whole.” Fujitsu Uvance Sustainability Management in the Fujitsu Group FUJITSU-PUBLIC @Fujitsu 2024 Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 3-3-1 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 11 ===== Value Creation Model Value Creation Model To achieve outcomes that contribute value to society, Fujitsu is setting targets (impact indicators) for FY2030 for the three materiality themes (Essential Contributions) from the perspective of their impacts on external stakeholders such as customers, society and, in particular, the environment. To address global environmental issues, it is essential that we work to minimize the environmental impacts among our companies and customers arising from issues such as more frequent natural disasters stricter regulatory regimes and as climate-related problems, particularly global warming, grow worse. By providing solutions and through its various activities, Fujitsu is helping customers and society to reduce their energy consumption, visualize and reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, enhance traceability, and bolster their resilience. We have set a specific impact indicator for FY2030 of “aiming for a reduction impact of roughly 0.3% of global total GHG emissions”. This is predicated on reducing our contribution to GHG emissions by the ICT industry, Fujitsu’s target market share and our in-house activities. To this end, we are undertaking monitoring and management to identify our actual GHG reductions using a range of output indicators. These include sales of Fujitsu Uvance solutions activities in our supply chains and within the company, activities by our investment targets, and, which will help us to achieve those indicators. FUJITSU-PUBLIC @Fujitsu 2024 Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 3-3-2 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 12 ===== Regarding the development of a digital society, the economic growth and technological advances that include digitalization can create a more prosperous society, but can also give rise to negative consequences such as greater inequality. However, digitalization is important for society as it offers both prosperity and stability and allows for the creation of a trusted society. By providing solutions and through its various activities, Fujitsu is contributing its customers and the broader society , to independently, freely and autonomously use digital technology to access accurate information. We have set a specific impact indicator for FY2030 of “helping to provide digital accessibility to more than 150 million p eople” based on future population trends and Fujitsu’s target market share. We are also undertaking monitoring and management using a range of output indicators to identify the actual number of people affected. These output indicators include a count of community activities, the services and solutions offered by sales of Fujitsu Uvance solutions, and our investment targets. Finally, regarding the improvement of people’s well-being, it is important to provide social value through education and upskilling in order to build human-centric lifestyle platforms that support everyone’s well-being. As well as working positively to provide high-quality education, we also need to offer appropriate assistance in support of measures such as personalized career plans to ensure that we do not exacerbate educational inequality. By providing solutions and through its various activities, Fujitsu is helping customers and society to appropriately improve their ICT skills and acquire ICT expertise. We have set a specific impact indicator for FY2030 of “contributing to the provision of ICT skills and training for at least 12 million p eople” as the based on future population trends, Fujitsu’s target market share and our delivery rate for ICT skills and training. We are also undertaking monitoring and management using a range of output indicators to identify the actual number of people affected. These output indicators include sales of Fujitsu Uvance solutions, the services and solutions offered by our investment targets, and community events and seminars. FUJITSU-PUBLIC @Fujitsu 2024 Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 3-3-3 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 13 ===== Materiality in the Fujitsu Group  The Fujitsu Group revised its approach to Materiality in 2023. We specified Materiality in 2018 under the  Basic CSR Policy but have now updated it to encompass Materiality in Management, which incorporates  the perspective of delivering value to customers and society through our business activities.  Looking ahead to 2030, we evaluated Materiality in terms of its importance to Fujitsu and its importance  to stakeholders in the medium- to long-term, and identified two categories of key issues that must be  resolved in order to achieve sustainable growth. The first category is ‘Areas of Essential contributions  to sustainable growth’ and the second is ‘Fundamentals for achieving sustainable development.’ In the  first category of Essential Contributions, we will leverage the development of Fujitsu Uvance and other  businesses to provide customers and society with value that contributes to solving global  environmental issues, developing a digital society, and improving people's well-being. Furthermore, we  will strengthen our technology, management foundation, and human capital to create the Foundation  for Achieving Sustainable Development as the source of value creation for the Fujitsu Group, while  supporting the creation of new business models and spurring innovation.  The results of the materiality assessment formulated in 2023 are also used for company-wide risk  management. Issues such as climate change, human rights, and security identified through materiality  analysis are linked as important risk items in potential risk assessments conducted throughout the  Fujitsu Group, some of which are disclosed as ''Business Risks.''  And Materiality-related initiatives are recommended as a goal-setting item in the “Executive  Performance Management” evaluation system for executives at FUJITSU VP-level and above. The non- financial indicators based on Materiality are being progressively linked to the evaluation indicators for  executive remuneration (Executive Director bonuses).  Going forward, we will continue to promote company-wide initiatives related to Materiality, reduce and  avoid critical management risks, and maximize business opportunities. In this way, we aim to enhance  the corporate value of the Fujitsu Group and contribute to achieving net positives in the areas of  environmental issues, digital society, and people's well-being.

We will conduct periodic reviews on an annual basis and  revise as necessary. This process receives third-party assurance.  Step 1     Organize and Identify Social Issues  ⚫ Create a long list of various social issues (163 issues) that will flow from the future megatrends anticipated for 2030 based on the following: ⚫ SDGs ⚫ Evaluations of ESG indices (FTSE, MSCI and DJSI) ⚫ ESG reporting framework (GRI Standards, SASB Standards) ⚫ World Economic Forum (WEF) Global Risk Reports ⚫ Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct ⚫ World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBSCD), Global Enabling Sustainability Initiative (GeSI) documentation ⚫ Identify 40 social issues by integrating similar items and deleting items with minimal business relevance Step 2  Prioritization  ⚫ Conduct surveys, interviews and desktop research with a wide range of internal and external stakeholders based on the identified social issues. In anticipation of future circumstances in 2030, create a draft materiality matrix that prioritizes 25 social issues from 40 social issues in terms of the risks and opportunities those issues present. The draft materiality matrix is created by conducting comprehensive assessments and assigning scores to issues from the perspectives of their importance to Fujitsu (financial impact of the environmental and social issues on Fujitsu) and their importance to stakeholders (environmental and social impact of Fujitsu business activities). ⚫ Leverage personal interviews and Sustainability Management Committee meetings to discuss and evaluate (ie, with reviews by executive directors, executive officers, non-executive directors and corporate auditors) the adequacy of the draft Materiality Matrix from the perspective of Fujitsu’s uniqueness (ie, affinity with the Fujitsu brand), and arrive at the final Materiality Matrix (condensed from 25 issues down to 18 issues).

Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 3-4-24 @Fujitsu 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 37 ===== Non-Financial Indicators Approach To contribute sustainably to the Fujitsu Purpose in the long term, it is essential to foster trusted relationships with all stakeholders. The Fujitsu Group has integrated non-financial indicators into its core business activities, promoting their achievement alongside financial targets.  To measure and verify our positive impact on customers and society, and to strengthen the Foundation for Achieving Sustainable Development, we set non-financial targets in the Medium-Term Management Plan announced in FY2023. These targets include key performance indicators (KIPs) such as: Customer Net Promoter Score (NPS®)(*1), Employee Engagement (EE), Diversity Leadership (ratio of women in leadership roles), Productivity Index, and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Reduction Rate. We are continuously monitoring the progress of these KPIs. (*1) Net Promoter, Net Promoter Score, and NPS are trademarks of NICE Satmetrix, Inc., Bain & Company, Inc. and Fred Reichheld. Net Promoter Score  (NPS®) Customer Net Promoter Score  (NPS®) (Customer NPS) is a metric used to objectively gauge the extent to which trusted relationships with customers helps create customer loyalty. Unlike customer satisfaction, which indicates the degree of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with a purchased product or service, customer loyalty is characterized by the ability to determine the degree of customer attachment and the likelihood of repeat purchases. The Fujitsu Group employs customer NPS as one of its non-financial indicators with the aim of realizing customer- centric management. By listening to our customers' views via NPS and offering services that appropriately suit their requirements, or by making proposals that anticipate their future needs, the value of the customer experience will be enhanced and our customer NPS will rise further. We believe that creating such a positive cycle will result in a boost to the corporate value of the Fujitsu Group. SM SM FUJITSU-PUBLIC @Fujitsu 2024 3-5-1 Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 38 ===== As a structure to achieve this objective, at the working level we have appointed customer experience leaders in each region to take the lead in a timely manner in relation to improvement activities. Action plans and awareness of issues developed through discussions between CX leaders and frontline employees are shared with management, ensuring that customer issues are addressed at the frontline level and treated as management issues. This creates a system with a ‘feedback loop’ to propose continuous improvement, examine areas for investment, and verify the effectiveness of measures already taken. Customer Net Promoter Score  (NPS®) Note: Given that the survey was conducted twice, FY2021 v alues were retroactively updated to the weighted average of the findings from the two surveys. In line with the FY2022 continuous improvement result of +18.1 poin ts and the FY2025 target of +20 points against a baseline of FY2022, we set a target of 6.5 points period-over-period for FY2023. Our activities resulted in an increase of +7.7 points period-over-period, exceeding the target. The Fujitsu Group is recognized, in particular, for providing proposals based on a deep understanding of the customer's business challenges, for experience in implementing DX, and for engaging in its own internal transformation. However, we recognize that our consulting capabilities to address customer business challenges and our ability to implement innovative, advanced, and swift transformation require further improvement. Through further reskilling and accumulation of DX business model validations, the entire Fujitsu Group will enhance its ability to provide comprehensive business support. SM FUJITSU-PUBLIC @Fujitsu 2024 3-5-2 Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 39 ===== Going forward, our Medium-Term Management Plan aims to boost the score by +20 points in FY2025 against a baseline of FY2022. Based on the results of the customer surveys conducted globally in FY2022 and FY2023, we will therefore focus on areas that require improvement, while continuing to improve the point scores in the areas that were evaluated as strengths. Employee Engagement The Fujitsu Group's greatest management resource is its employees, who are the source of the value provided to customers. Our experience suggests that highly engaged employees are better able to provide high-quality services to our customers, and that positive customer feedback correlates to an increase in employees' responsiveness to their work. We believe that improving the engagement of each employee leads to the growth of both the individual and the Fujitsu Group. Based on this concept, to measure the sustainable growth of the Fujitsu Group we established Employee Engagement as a non-financial indicator that shows the mindset of employees and their empathy with the organizational culture. At Fujitsu, Employee Engagement is defined as “an indicator that shows the degree of employees’ motivation and attachment to work and their willingness to contribute independently in empathy with the company’s direction and purpose.” Employee Engagement can also be considered an indicator that illustrates the Fujitsu Group has the necessary human resources and other capabilities, including organizational culture, to gain the trust of customers as a DX partner. The target Employee Engagement value of “75” is a figure that has been determined by benchmarking against global corporations. The actual scores can vary greatly across the Group, because they are impacted by the relevant company's business area, the business environments in different countries and regions, and the diversity of our employees’ countries of origin. While it is true that “75” is an ambitious target for the Fujitsu Group, we are nonetheless striving to achieve this goal with the aim of being on par with other global enterprises. Fujitsu has implemented a framework comprising a Center of Expertise (CoE), a specialist team dedicated to creating highly engaged organizations, and Human Resource Business Partners (HRBP), a team of strategic HR partners who work with leaders at the highest level in organizations in Japan and in our overseas regions to boost engagement. FUJITSU-PUBLIC @Fujitsu 2024 3-5-3 Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 40 ===== As a specific initiative, we have introduced measures to broaden employees' workstyle options, after clarifying their individual purpose. This includes a semiannual survey conducted on a global basis to measure employee engagement. Survey items include questions about the employee’s sense of fulfillment in working for the Fujitsu Group, the connection between the Fujitsu Purpose and the employee’s own work, and the degree to which the employee’s individual strengths are demonstrated. Past surveys have clearly shown that senior and middle management in each organization must be the driving force in action-taking together with their team members to boost engagement. Strong relationships built on trust between managers and employees are also important. Survey findings are compiled on a manager-by- manager basis and are used to bolster support for management improvement by presenting each manager with the most appropriate Recommended Actions. Going forward, we plan to establish a data-driven cycle to improve organizational performance and individual wellbeing, leveraging the insights gained from analyzing engagement data to take even more effective action.

To transition into an enterprise capable of sustainably generating innovations and providing value to customers while meeting the requirements of communities with diversified values, it is essential to create an environment and culture in which a diversity of people can each optimally leverage their different viewpoints and abilities. As a first step toward this objective, we have set the ratio of women in leadership roles as a new non-financial indicator. We based this on the results of research that determined “when the ratio of a minority group in an organization reaches 30% a chain reaction occurs that changes the organizational culture.” The target set for the end of FY2030 is to have a 30% ratio of women in leadership roles throughout the Fujitsu Group, with an interim milestone target of 20% by the end of FY2025.  In addition to the above, we will encourage various initiatives such as mindset transformation, positive action, and the promotion of Work Life Shift to improve the work environment. Ratio of women in leadership roles FUJITSU-PUBLIC @Fujitsu 2024 3-5-5 Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 42 ===== Per capita productivity Up until FY2022, the Fujitsu Group was using DX Promotion Indices, that is, metrics for measuring the level of DX maturity (*2), for implementing DX policies such as vision sharing, mindset, talent development, IT reform, business process reform, and business model reform. This laid the foundation for transformation, enabling the company to continuously implement transformation based on company-wide strategies.  In order to move into the next stage of transformation, we need to demonstrate that DX is contributing to business transformation and increased competitiveness, and is a driver for generating greater corporate value. From FY2023, we have set a new ‘productivity indicator’ for operating income per capita, which is an indicator for measuring business efficiency. The target as at the end of FY2025 is set at 40%+ against a baseline of FY2022. As one of the activities to achieve this target, we are pursuing an initiative centered on data visualization and cause-and- effect analysis as productivity indicators. We believe that visualizing our own current position will encourage discussion and decision-making on productivity from the perspective of management and the workplace respectively, leading to actions that will increase individual as well as corporate productivity. In order for the Fujitsu Group to become a true DX company, we will achieve greater efficiency in time usage, communication, and business processes through the use of AI and digital technologies based on more sophisticated IT investments. We will implement productivity improvements in collaboration and interaction with various initiatives, unfettered by preconceived ideas or stereotypes.

Subsequently, following a review of climate change impacts (loss, damage, etc.) based on the latest scientific knowledge, it was declared at the COP26 Glasgow Agreement that the preferred 1.5 ℃ target would now become the actual target and that the world must aim to achieve net zero by mid- century (around 2050). These rapid changes led the Fujitsu Group to announce a target of net zero for GHG emissions in its supply chain by FY2040, with an interim target of net zero for GHG emissions in Fujitsu’s own business areas by FY2030. To help achieve these objectives, we released the Environmental Action Plan (Stage XI). This plan runs up to FY2025, a milestone on the path to the targets, and will give shape to our specific initiatives as we work toward the realization of carbon neutrality. GHG emissions reduction rate FY2025 target and FY2023 results (compared to FY2020) As a leading SX company, Fujitsu has a role to play in applying technology to help solve challenges for customers and society while expanding and enhancing the value provided as we collaborate with customers and partners to achieve a sustainable future. It is therefore essential to confirm the global trends and the actions taken in regard to climate change challenges, because a delayed response could lead to a loss of business opportunities. Against this backdrop, we consider the reduction of GHG emissions to be a critical issue and are working on it as one of our non-financial indicators. FUJITSU-PUBLIC @Fujitsu 2024 3-5-7 Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 44 ===== Intellectual Property (IP) Strategy to Support Fujitsu's Purpose Policy (IP Management and Corporate Value) Fujitsu’s Purpose is to make the world more sustainable by building trust in society through innovation. To achieve this, the aim of our intellectual property management policy is to contribute to innovation and new value creation in the Fujitsu Group by strategically building and utilizing intellectual capital, including our technology, our brand and our designs. Intellectual property management has two facets. One is the construction of an intellectual property portfolio including prosecution for the intellectual capital already held by the Fujitsu Group and then using that portfolio to create new value. The other facet is risk management, which consists of lowering the incidence of risks likely to diminish our corporate or social value, primarily through measures that promote respect for and prevent violations of our rights and those of third parties. Contributing to Value Creation We are progressing and appropriately managing the acquisition of the rights to the technology developed by the Fujitsu Group and to the designs and brands created to deploy that technology in the community. This expands our opportunities for generating licensing income, better differentiates our offerings from the technologies and services provided by competitors and maintains or enhances the competitive advantage of Fujitsu Group technologies and services. We are also assisting with the search for new growth opportunities by investigating, analyzing and sharing information on a wide range of global technology trends, including the status of patent applications in strategically important areas for the Fujitsu Group. Open Source Software (OSS) is an indispensable resource for digital services, and Fujitsu is an active participant in the OSS community, helping to create environments that promote innovation and build a value co- creation ecosystem by formulating rules for the use of intellectual property.

Third party violations of rights held by the Fujitsu Group not only obstruct the progress of our business strategy, they also have the potential to negatively impact customers’ trust in the Fujitsu brand in a competitive environment. For this reason, we constantly monitor for violations of our rights, and where a proposal is discovered that could potentially cause a rights violation, we immediately put in place appropriate countermeasures. Fujitsu’s Code of Conduct which, together with our Purpose and Values makes up the Fujitsu Way, clearly states our commitment to respecting and protecting intellectual property and respecting the intellectual property rights of others, just as they respect our own acquisition of rights to intellectual capital. We are formulating Rules for Handling Intellectual Property Rights that link this Code of Conduct to specific actions, and these rules are being applied to Fujitsu and Group companies in Japan that undertake actions involving intellectual property. We are also working to reduce the risks of violating rights held by third parties through measures such as thoroughly researching patent violation avoidance, careful OSS license management, and responding to in-house consultation requests concerning the terms of intellectual property agreements.

In addition to collaborating within each division, the Business & Legal Department promotes intellectual property activities for business producers and SEs, and also collaborates with Fujitsu Techno Research Ltd., which provides intellectual property-related services, to execute intellectual property management. The formulation of IP management strategy and policy for the activities of the Intellectual Property Division is not limited solely to the Division itself, but is undertaken in collaboration with the Technology Units headed by the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and Chief Portfolio Officer (CPO) and with the responsible IP strategy managers within the Business Units. In this way, IP management is integrated with our broader management strategy, technology strategy, and business portfolio strategy. In addition, at meetings of the Independent Directors & Auditors Council, which includes external directors and auditors, the Head of the Legal and Intellectual Property Unit reports on the strategy and progress of intellectual property management and provides opportunities for discussion with management. Group-wide Global Collaboration Fujitsu has developed an intellectual property governance structure to make the best possible use of its intellectual capital throughout the Fujitsu Group. This ensures that IP-related activities undertaken by Group companies in Japan are integrated. Where a company undertakes independent IP activities as a partial exception, a reporting line is set up and the activity is conducted through close collaboration. Globally, including the utilization of the reporting line, periodic meetings are held involving regional IP managers from the 5 regions of Europe, India, China, Australia and the United States. Additionally, through intellectual property support for research facilities established in another 8 countries around the world to ensure that all IP management conforms to the realities of global business.

Taking a structured approach to progressing Fujitsu’s IP activities linkage with our technology strategy and business portfolio strategies helps to maintain and strengthen the Fujitsu Group’s competitive advantage and acquire new business opportunities. In intellectual property activities, in order to achieve competitive superiority, we are strengthening the collaboration between the intellectual property division and the research division, analyzing the strengths of technologies under development in the market from intellectual property information, and feeding back the results from the intellectual property division to the research division. We are also promoting initiatives by identifying areas where international standardization and Open Source Software (OSS) should be actively utilized.

To achieve carbon neutrality, CO  emissions must be reduced not only in one company but also across the entire supply chain. For this purpose, it is necessary to calculate the product carbon footprint (PCF) of each component in cooperation with component suppliers for the products, and to link data between companies. As a PACT member, Fujitsu participated in rule-making about PCF calculation methods and the technical specifications for data exchange. Under the demonstration program, Fujitsu collaborated with Nagase & Co., Ltd, Zeroboard Inc. and other companies, to calculate CO  emissions for the entire supply chain by linking PCF data among the companies using Fujitsu Track and Trust, a PACT-compliant solution for the supply chain of Fujitsu notebook PC manufacturing. Fujitsu plans to collaborate with industry organizations and stakeholders including WBCSD to contribute to data exchange between companies and standardization of methodologies in the future. This know-how will be offered as an ESG managed platform service and a digital supply chain service under Fujitsu Uvance. 2 2 2 2 Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 3-6-9 @Fujitsu 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 53 ===== Image of wearing ''Ontenna'' Fujitsu PACT program “Ontenna” User Interface – Feeling sound A mixed-IP strategy to support solutions to societal challenges Ontenna is a radically new user-interface device that can be worn on the hair, earlobe, collar, cuff, etc., enabling the wearer to pick up tonal characteristics through vibration and light.

It is a device that tested repeatedly with the aim of creating an experience that is easy for anyone to use and that makes daily train use enjoyable. Announcements inside the station platform and the environmental sound of the train collected by the microphone are analyzed by AI, converted into letters and sign language in real time, and displayed on the dedicated display. Onomatopoeia animation is used to transcribe environmental sounds, and a video by JR East station staff and DNP's ''emotion-expressing font'' are used for sign language. These are displayed according to the sound information of each station platform. Fujitsu’s FX1000 supercomputer was used in the AI development. Design Features : Announcements and sounds around the information display installed in the station can be displayed as text on this display monitor. Unique fonts are used for the characters displayed on the monitor, and the movement and expression of the characters are elaborated. Design Impact : Station announcements and audio can be displayed on the screens so that they can be easily understood by deaf people. Emergency announcements in the station and train delay information can also be displayed. Also, when station audio is not being displayed, the screen can display advertising.

However, in the current era of VUCA (*1) we face major changes and the future is difficult to predict. It is therefore important that we, as a member of the global community, conduct business activities under the leadership of senior management that are aimed at resolving environmental, societal and economic problems and that will produce beneficial impacts for society. In April 2020, we established a Sustainability Management Committee that will drive a sustainability-focused management approach under the supervision and direction of the Board of Directors Meeting and the Executive Management Council Meeting. As of fiscal 2024, the committee is made up of corporate executives or SVPs appointed by the Fujitsu CEO. It is chaired by the Fujitsu CEO with the Corporate Vice President acting as the Vice Chairperson. (As of May 2024, the committee had 15 m embers, including the chair.) The objective of this committee is sustainability management that takes into account environmental, societal and economic impacts as well as stakeholder(*2) interests, ensuring that the company prospers in the long term as a responsible global enterprise. Specific initiatives will be in line with our values and our purpose, set out in the revised Fujitsu Way, and will include boosting our efforts in non-financial areas. These include respect for human rights, acceptance of diversity and equity, human resource development, maintenance of the global environment and contributing to the development of regional communities. Our goal is to achieve sustainable, long-term improvement in the corporate value of the Fujitsu Group. The committee is scheduled to meet once every 6 months, and on an ad hoc basis as required, to review the progress of our activities in non-financial areas and determine whether we are on track to meeting our targets. The committee’s other duties include conducting checks and discussions on sustainability-related businesses and deliberating on new activities. It then reports the results during management meetings and to the Board of Directors.

To date, the meetings have been characterized by lively discussions on topics such as non-financial indicators and Global Responsible Business activities as we aim to implement materiality in order to achieve 2030 vision of being a technology company that realizes net positive through digital services. System Chart （*1 ） VUCA: Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity （*2） The Fujitsu Group’s stakeholders: The Fujitsu Group regards our people, customers, partners, community and shareholders as its stakeholders. Government authorities, NPOs, NGOs, and similar organizations are also particularly important stakeholders within this community. Global Responsible Business Since its CSR Promotion Committee established the Basic Strategy Working Group in 2010, th e Fujitsu Group has identified Five Priority Issues in its Basic CSR Policy and has been promoting activities that address those priority issues. The working group conducted interviews with outside experts regarding the expectations and demands on the Fujitsu Group, based on an awareness of global CSR standards and social issues. Since 2015, w e have seen a further ramping up of demand for initiatives aimed at responding to challenges on a global scale, including the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by the United Nations and the coming into effect of the COP 21 P aris Agreement related to climate change. Based on the outcomes of a new analysis of the issues, in light of the business changes within the Fujitsu Group, we have also re-calibrated our sustainability issues and our framework for those issues under the banner of Global Responsible Business (GRB). FUJITSU-PUBLIC @Fujitsu 2024 4-1-2 Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 61 ===== Global Responsible Business The GRB framework aims to foster the mindset and corporate culture necessary to realize the Fujitsu Way by engaging in specific activities that address our priority issues and to earn and maintain the social trust that is a prerequisite for global business activities. All Group employees must be constantly aware that their companies are part of society and aim to not only pursue profits but also reduce the negative impact of their business activities on sustainability issues while maximizing the positive. To achieve these objectives, we are undertaking specific actions toward achieving our targets by March 2026. Employees based at our headquarters, who are responsible for each of the priority issues, helped formulate these targets, while personnel in overseas regions with similar responsibilities also provided input in this regard. These actions will enable us to carry out activities at a higher level globally while still taking into account the differences between countries and regions in such areas as local laws and labor markets. Raising Awareness and Disseminating Information Internally and Externally To realize our corporate purpose, we engage in businesses that have a beneficial impact on resolving challenges in society, and to conduct our operations in a responsible manner throughout all business activities, we are implementing a range of measures to raise awareness and enhance our employees’ understanding of GRB. In addition, we disseminate information outside the company to convey to stakeholders the Fujitsu Group’s position on sustainability management and related initiatives. At internal and external events and presentations, we introduce the non-financial framework around Fujitsu’s sustainability management and explain how an executive leader has been appointed for each of the priority issues as we implement initiatives on a global basis. Employee understanding is further enhanced through our intranet sites in both Japanese and English, which are updated as required by GRB operations staff. We use engagement surveys and questionnaires at events to collect employee feedback relating to sustainability, and use that feedback to inform policy formulation and implementation both internally and externally.

Fujitsu’s purpose is “to make the world more sustainable by building trust in society through innovation” and our company has made a commitment, both internally and externally, to contribute to achieving the SDGs. As a global enterprise that for decades has leveraged technology to create value for society, Fujitsu has a responsibility to proactively contribute to societal transformation. To help make the world more sustainable, we aim to generate larger and more beneficial impacts for society, which will also help to spur ongoing sustainable corporate growth. In the Medium-Term Management Plan released in May 2023, we set out our vision for 2030 of being “a technology company that realizes net positive (*1) through digital services''. To achieve this vision, our aim is to contribute to the SDGs by working on the Essential Contributions to Materiality: Solving global environmental issues, developing a digital society, and improving people’s well-being.  Fujitsu believes the SDGs essentially define a system transformation that must be achieved by 2030 so that the predicted global population of more than 9 billion by 2050 will be able to live well, within the limitations of our planet. The issues highlighted in the SDGs involve a complex web of environmental, social, and economic elements. One key to solving these inherent problems is through society-wide digital transformation (DX). Fujitsu will harness the power of digital technology to create ecosystems that transcend industry boundaries and assist in the transformation of our customers and our own organizations, while playing a part in delivering fundamental changes to the way society interacts and contributes to the resolution of societal challenges. The SDGs are an overarching framework of global social and environmental needs and form a common language for all stakeholders. Fujitsu will use its efforts to realize the SDGs as an opportunity for co- creation with a wide range of stakeholders, including international agencies, national and regional governments, private companies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and non-profit organizations (NPOs). By embracing a multifaceted approach to societal challenges, we can create and maximize positive impacts on an even larger scale. *1 Fujitsu defines net positive as follows: “In addition to maximizing financial returns, we are committed to solving global environmental problems, developing a digital society, and improving people’s well-being.

The objective is to make our employees routinely conscious of whether they are contributing to achieving the SDGs so that they approach their business activities from the standpoint of addressing social issues. Using Digital Technology and Services to Contribute to the SDGs Supercomputer Fugaku technology supporting detailed prediction of meteorological disasters and helping build resilient societies With the growing number of meteorological disasters in recent years, highly accurate predictions have become increasingly important in minimizing the damage caused. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) collects and analyzes both domestic and international observations of events such as torrential rain, earthquakes and tsunamis, which it uses to generate disaster prevention and meteorological data on a daily basis. Providing this data to disaster prevention agencies and to citizens contributes to disaster preparedness and helps maintain traffic safety. However, the August 2018 a nd March 2023 meetings of the Council for Transport Policy’s Environment subcommittee highlighted the need to further enhance the accuracy of forecasting and promote the sharing and use of data with private- sector enterprises and research facilities. Fujitsu has some 20 years’ of experience operating community systems such as the JMA’s ADESS (*2) and AMeDAS Center systems (*3). Fujitsu’s PRIMEHPC FX1000 (*4) uses the same technology as the Supercomputer Fugaku (*5). This supercomputer system introduced in 2023 enables to improve the accuracy of linear rainband prediction.

Key SDGs related to this project Optical Network Business Initiatives Working Towards a Decarbonized Society With the nationwide roll-out of 5G services in Japan, users are increasingly turning towards services that support high data capacities for large data files such as video. This is expected to further increase power consumption, which highlights the need for initiatives to help decarbonize communications providers and datacenter businesses. To address this issue, Fujitsu has been focusing its energies on developing the industry leading optical transmission technology to enable large capacity and low power consumption. This technology has now been adopted by major network service providers in Japan. NTT Group is building a next- generation network with Fujitsu’s optical transmission system that leverages liquid cooling technology. KDDI and SoftBank have also newly deployed Fujitsu solutions to boost the capacity of their network infrastructure, while significantly reducing their power consumption and decarbonizing their entire optical network.

To address this problem, Fujitsu has been collaborating since April 2022 with the Southern TOHOKU General Hospital (*10) and others to promote the development of AI technology to detect pancreatic cancer from non-contrast CT scans, such as those widely carried out during general health checks and similar procedures. Due to the low levels of contrast in non-contrast CT scans, it has always been difficult to identify the location of the pancreas and detect cancers. So, Fujitsu has used AI to develop a technology that estimates the continuity across adjacent cross-sectional scans, taking into account the patient’s anatomy. It automatically conducts three-dimensional analysis in areas with strong continuity in the images and planar analysis in areas with weak continuity. The results of evaluations of the CT scans from the Southern TOHOKU General Hospital show that locations where cancer is suspected in the pancreas area were successfully detected with 90% accuracy. This AI technology is the result of the use of converging technologies (*11)  that integrate Fujitsu’s image analysis technology with the clinical observations made by the Southern TOHOKU General Hospital, and is likely to make a significant contribution to improving the early discovery of pancreatic cancer. In 2023, this technology was unveiled to over 20,000 physicians and other participants at JDDW 2023 (*12) , where it demonstrated the advanced level of the technology addressing social needs. Fujitsu will continue to make its research findings available to treatment and health-promotion services as part of our contribution towards building healthy communities.

However, these systems are fixed in place and not portable, and are also expensive to install, both of which are issues making their installation in all vehicles difficult. Also, to enhance fire-fighting forces and cope with the increasing number of emergency call-outs, there is demand for reduced workloads and effective information sharing through the use of smart devices in order to reduce employee fatigue and eliminate workforce shortages. To address these issues, Fujitsu has used its expertise in building Fire-Fighting command systems to develop a smartphone-based integrated information sharing system that Fire-Fighters and Emergency Medical Technicians can use on-site at accidents and other disasters. This system provides a wide range of functions to support fire-fighters and paramedics right from the initial call-out through to writing up their reports. This includes a push notification function that uses vibrations to prevent miscommunication in radio calls and missed notifications involving vital information, a timeline function that uses a chat function to share real-time status updates from the different services even after responders have exited their vehicles, and a function that records data such as casualties’ vital signs and treatment details to assist responders in generating incident reports after they leave the scene.

In the event of a emergency such as a large-scale disaster situation, this system allows flexible vehicle operation. For example, it can be used as an AVM system in transport vehicles not normally equipped with AVM, such as loudspeaker vans and shipping vehicles. Going forward, Fujitsu will continue to support the on-site activities of fire and ambulance services, contributing to the establishment of resilient communities where citizens can enjoy rich and secure lives.

However, due to the enormous amounts of computing power and electricity required to make advanced AI a reality, there are serious concerns about the environmental impacts of developing and running AI. Another important and emerging issue is the global supply shortage of the GPU chips that are essential for AI processing. To help resolve these issues, Fujitsu is developing and supplying the ‘AI Computing Broker’ middleware technology (*14), which allows AI calculations to be executed efficiently even with a small number of GPU chips. This is the world’s first technology capable of identifying and prioritizing, in real-time which of multiple processes being run concurrently will achieve the greatest improvements in processing efficiency if allocated a GPU. This technology allows AI processing to be performed with half, or even less, of the usual number of GPUs. The latest GPUs consume 700 watts of power per chip, making them the major consumers of power in AI computing. Reducing the number of GPUs used significantly reduces the power consumption in AI development and operation. For example, for the very large 10,000-GPU systems needed for large-scale AI development, annual power consumption can be reduced by as much as 30,660 MWh (*15) . Our goal at Fujitsu is to provide computing platforms that help to generate the innovations that will build a future sustainable society.

Another issue is that the large volumes of data involved in that process can include inherent biases, which the technology encourages. Even when used with care, AI can lead to unforeseen consequences for people. There have been reports of cases of wrongful judgment due to misidentification by AI as well as ethical issues such as inequality of access, which can erode people’s trust in AI. This is why the Fujitsu Group considers it an essential part of its responsibility as an AI researcher, developer, provider and operator to make AI solutions that are not only powerful to improve our society, but that are also safe and secure. The Fujitsu Group has long advocated a ‘human centric’ approach and argued that information technology should fundamentally be used to focus on, and to benefit, people. In March 2019, as a reflection of the rapid recent development of AI technologies, the Fujitsu Group formulated and announced the ''Fujitsu Group AI Commitment''. As one of the companies which carries out AI-related businesses including research, development, provision and operation activities, we aim to emphasize the importance of communication with a wide range of stakeholders in the community, including users and consumers, as we distribute the enormous value of AI to society. For that purpose, the commitment outlines our promises with customers and the community. The Fujitsu Group has identified the ethical risks listed below arising from the use of AI, and is formulating mitigation measures to address emerging risks that could significantly impact our future business. Fujitsu Group AI Commitment FUJITSU-PUBLIC @Fujitsu 2024 Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 5-1-1-16 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 108 ===== Emerging Risks The Ethical Risks of Utilizing AI Description As a company that has been researching, developing, providing, and operating AI technologies since before the 1980s , Fujitsu has long asserted that information technology must be used in a human-centered manner. In recent years, there have been reports of troubling instances whereby ethical problems have arisen from the use of AI in the handling of privacy information. Examples include discrimination and unfairness due to negative outputs caused by biased training data. Such cases can undermine people’s trust in AI. Fujitsu therefore considers it an essential part of its responsibility as an AI researcher, developer, provider and operator to offer AI that is convenient, safe and secure to use. Impact As we see the widespread use of AI increasing with unprecedented speed, particularly in the case of generative AI, there is also a risk that users and consumers who have experienced issues with AI provided by Fujitsu may file claims for damages and thereby harm the Fujitsu Group’s reputation. In addition, the European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) requires developers, users, and other stakeholders to take strict action based on the level of risk that their AI systems could pose to the enjoyment of human rights. Violations could result in penalties, including fines of up to 7% of total global sales. This makes implementing appropriate risk management in the development and operation of AI systems essential.

Part of this dialogue involves feedback on the “Fujitsu Group AI Commitment”, which serves as the Group’s AI ethical guidelines. The Company also participates in international discussions on AI Ethics through its membership in AI4People and other forums. By virtue of these risk mitigating actions, Fujitsu Group management and staff can become aware of the ethical risks of AI and understand the precautions needed when researching, developing, providing, and operating AI. By minimizing the likelihood of situations that might cause inconvenience to users and customers, we can foster people’s trust in AI. As a company that researches, develops, provides, and operates AI technologies, we aim to communicate knowledge about the rich value that AI brings, while emphasizing dialogue with a wide range of social stakeholders, including users and consumers.

Because we believe it is crucial that C-level management recognizes the importance of AI Ethics in order to establish a corporate culture which promotes AI Ethics, the Fujitsu Group has set up the “Fujitsu Group External Advisory Committee on AI Ethics”, which comprises external experts in the field, to objectively evaluate AI Ethics initiatives in the Group. A summary of the committee’s discussions is shared with the Board of Directors Meeting, incorporating the group's efforts for AI Ethics into its corporate governance framework and allowing for ongoing review and improvement.

Given that AI Ethics is integral to corporate governance, we report on the above at board meetings. We conducted an e-learning course on “AI Ethics” for Fujitsu Group employees in Japan; 93% of all domestic employees took part. To prevent discrimination or injustice that may be caused by AI, specialized departments within Fujitsu conduct ethical screening on all AI business project opportunities presented to customers and implement risk mitigation measures according to the type of AI and its application. Aiming to raise awareness of AI Ethics among AI developers, AI users and a large number of stakeholders, and so reduce the risk of violating human rights that may be caused by AI, the “Fujitsu Group External Advisory Committee on AI Ethics” made its recommendations and Fujitsu's practices available to the public. We published guidelines externally on the use of generative AI to help society as a whole make appropriate use of generative AI. We wanted to share information about the risks related to impartiality in generative AI and to disseminate messages of caution about the use of generative AI, including how to respond to the risk of impartiality. In particular, we also wanted to share information to users about human rights violations such as discrimination that may be caused by generative AI. We conducted joint research with universities and gave lectures to high school students as part of our activities to raise awareness of AI Ethics and work on developing human resources through industry-academia collaboration.

School dropout rates are high, opportunities to turn to drugs and crime are rife, and very few young people go on to higher education. Fujitsu has been supporting In Aid of the Children of Venezuela (Chamos)’s partnership with a local non-profit, Queremos Graduarnos (QG), to motivate children and young people to attend school. Chamos, in cooperation with Espacio Educa, offers weekly extracurricular classes in computer programming languages, software, and digital literacy. Fe y Alegria Maria Inmaculada College started offering the course in October 2023 and has accepted 43 young people so far. “Fujitsu’s generosity to date has given young people the chance to improve their digital literacy skills, explore computer programming and most importantly gives them a sense of agency and self-belief. We work with vulnerable communities where over 80 percent of the population live below the poverty line and the majority have no access to technology or internet connection at home. So with Fujitsu, we have been able to provide foundational skills to close the stark inequality gap in Venezuelan society, as well as introducing computer programming for students with aspirations to work in a STEM-related field.” FUJITSU-PUBLIC @Fujitsu 2024 Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 5-1-1-25 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 117 ===== Women participating in the digital literacy curriculum -Mariana Siblesz de Alvarez, Chair at Chamos In Aid of the Children of Venezuela Young people from vulnerable environments taking classes Digital literacy curriculum for Yemeni women and girls implemented by the International Rescue Committee (IRC) (in Yemen) Fujitsu supports the IRC in its efforts to improve the digital literacy of women and adolescent girls.

The results are reported to the Executive Management Council and the Board of Directors.  For Fujitsu, the materiality of Human Capital in terms of DE&I serves as a foundation for our  sustainable development, and the Chief Human Resource Officer is charged with this responsibility.  As a forum for considering specific measures, we hold regular meetings that include DE&I promoters  from all regions. Led by DE&I for Global Responsible Business (GRB), participants share the issues and  measures taken in their own regions and also plan globally coordinated promotion measures.  Additionally, we carry out an annual engagement survey that includes questions related to DE&I  in order to grasp the overall situation and confirm the progress of initiatives from employee  opinions.  In terms of systems, we have established measures to more proactively promote diversity leadership  and inclusion based on our organizational commitment, such as training programs to expand the  pipeline for the promotion of women executives and the inclusion of DE&I items as non-financial  indicators in the evaluation of our organizational heads.  Initiatives for Fostering Corporate Culture  DE&I Session  In order to foster a corporate culture at Fujitsu where  “anyone can play an active role in their  own way,”  we annually hold a global DE&I session with the aim  of getting employees to see DE&I in  a new light and  inspiring a new mindset and  behavioral change.  The theme of the 2023 session was ''Toward  Inclusion Beyond Diversity - What we could  do in an organization where diverse people could   actively play a role.” Following the presentation by an outside lecturer, the President, executives and  employees held a dialogue about inclusion, with enthusiastic participation from many employees from  each global region.

Some workplaces are using this video content to hold their own workshops to help individuals  understand their unconscious bias to further promote understanding of DE&I.  Endorsement of International Standards and  Initiative Participation  In FY2017, the Fujitsu Group issued a CEO Statement of Support for the Women’s Empowerment  Principles, which were created by the UN Global Compact and UN Women. In doing so, we pledged  our support of the principles. In FY2018, we also became the first Japanese company to pledge our  support to the UN’s LGBTI Standards of Conduct for business, and have been proactive overall in our  adaptation to global trends in diversity.

At Fujitsu, these efforts involve nominating women employees from the leaders of each  department as candidates for top management, and establishing/implementing individually tailored  training programs for these employees alongside their workplace, the management, HR, and DE&I  promotion teams. In addition to these kinds of management-track leadership programs, we also  conduct workshops and events that allow female employees to reflect and build on their careers in all  other tracks as well.  These expand and act as pipelines to drive female employees to further advancement, and allow us to  support the careers of each and every employee.   Career Workshop for Female Employees  Fujitsu and its domestic Group companies have developed a program that is primarily for female  employees on a leadership track with the goal of further encouraging their career development. It  includes a workshop with external lecturers, dialogue with multiple role models, and discussions with  senior executives. Our goal with this workshop, for which participation is completely voluntary, is to  help eliminate any internalized prejudice as to their manager-level career development, expand their  career options, acquire the broader perspective needed to perform in high-level positions, and  develop a sense of ownership over their careers.  FY2023 participants: 654 (from Fujitsu and domestic Group companies in Japan)  Regional Initiatives  In the Europe region, we shared information on men’s health and provided talk events in celebration  of International Men’s Day on November 19, providing an opportunity to understand and realizing DE&I  concerning men. In the Asia Pacific region, Fujitsu Australia and Fujitsu New Zealand formulated their  “Gender Equity Strategy 2024-26” with the aim of recruiting more women and a diversity of people.  Because a diverse team that is reflective of society is an innovative one, Fujitsu will continue to  improve its gender mix in its operations. With this ambitious goal, we aim to be an employer of choice  for women.  The Global Delivery Business Group offers a program called INSPIRE to empower women leaders. The  program that aims to expand the network of female employees, enhances diversity and support  women leaders through an assessment to identify one's strengths, four leadership development  modules, and dialogue with role model leaders within the company, offers a wealth of growth  opportunities and global experience.

In each regions, DE&I promotion teams and  employee network groups work together to raise awareness of disabilities by holding events such as  webinars and roundtables to promote understanding of persons with disabilities, and also conduct  various initiatives aimed at boosting employee awareness about disabilities.   In Japan, we held a webinar on neurodiversity was held and broadcast it to our operation bases across  the country.  Creating a Inclusive Workplace  At Fujitsu, we do not impose restrictions on the  types of jobs available to people with disabilities. As  such, there are people with disabilities who work in a  wide range of jobs, from sales staff to SEs, R&D staff,  corporate staff, and more.  For the hiring process, we publish pamphlets and  websites aimed at job seekers with disabilities, which  include employee interviews, our stance on the  employment of people with disabilities, and describes   how employees work after joining the company. This information communicates how we provide an  affirming and individually oriented workplace for all, with or without a disability. We also conduct  long-term follow-up after joining the company, from training until getting settled in their jobs, to  ensure performance to the best of their abilities.   Examples of this include special training programs when they enter the company, and workplace- oriented consultations so that each employee is able to perform to the best of their abilities.   We also created a manual for workplaces, called the Work Style Guideline. It lists the things that  employees should consider when working with employees with disabilities, according to each type of  disability, to help understanding in the workplace.   In addition, we introduced a diversity communication tool—FUJITSU Software LiveTalk—as a common  service for Fujitsu and its domestic Group companies, in order to support smooth communication and  efficient operations which include employees who are hearing-impaired.

As part of this effort, Fujitsu set up a dialogue forum  for employees across generations to deepen mutual  understanding as they discuss their values and job  satisfaction.  The Europe region has implemented “Perspective,” a  reverse mentoring program in which rank-and-file  employees become mentors to executives, which is  the opposite of the traditional mentoring relationship.   Thirty-two pairs of reverse mentor-mentees  participated in up to six mentoring sessions each,  providing an opportunity for regular employees to  think deeply about leadership and for  executives to understand the mindset and culture of younger employees and gain new IT skills.  This program has had a positive impact on our organizational culture at our various locations in  Europe.  In the Asia Pacific region, Fujitsu Vietnam employees participated in a running competition to raise  funds to purchase library books for an elementary school in the city of Yen Bai. Fujitsu Vietnam  donated funds for the purchase of the school’s library books for the library according to the distance  run. At the same time, employees and their families donated their used children's books to the library,  connecting employees and families of various generations to empower children in their communities.

Childbirth and Childcare  Fujitsu has established an Action Plan (*3) in accordance with the Act on Advancement of Measures to  Support Raising Next-Generation Children. We also provide babysitter subsidies and have in-house  childcare facilities in our business offices. Several times a year, we also conduct seminars for  employees who have just returned from parental leave, as well as seminars for supervisors of  employees who are on parental leave, with the aim of providing workplace support and constructing  networks, in addition to promoting diversity management.   Furthermore, in addition to support seminars for employees who are about to take maternity or child  care leave, we also hold seminars for employees who are thinking about their career plans based on  taking maternity or child care leave in the future, employees whose partners are about to have a baby,  and supervisors, to fully support employees in balancing work and childcare.  Number of employees using the childcare/nursing care system and return-to-work and retention rates after childcare/nursing care leave (Fujitsu) > (*3) Action Plan:  The first Action Plan was implemented in 2005.

We believe that addressing the well-being of our employees and contributing to the well- being of society will lead to Fujitsu's Purpose, to “Make the world more sustainable by building trust in society through innovation. We believe our employees’ well-being is “A state in which each of us acts on our authentic values, and progresses for a brighter future through work and life.” We believe that it is important for our employees to be able to feel ''well-being'' from an individual perspective in order to achieve well-being that shows more sustainable happiness, rather than momentary happiness. The Fujitsu Group has broken down its concept of well-being into four categories. Although each individual will prioritize a different category for their own well-being because of each individuals’ circumstances, we believe that we can approach the state of well-being through work when these factors are met.

So that we can achieve a sustainable world, Fujitsu is focusing on creating an organization that brings together a diverse group of people with expertise and experience, leveraging the technology areas in which the company has always excelled. In addition, to support each employee's autonomous learning and growth rather than providing uniform training from the company, we offer a wide range of learning and career options based on common global policies. We support employees to become their desired selves by revising systems, promoting reskilling and upskilling in accordance with the transformation of our business portfolio, and provide an environment that enables each employee to act autonomously with a sense of fulfillment emphasizing improvements in employees’ sense of job satisfaction and engagement. To Achieve Career Ownership We introduced a new personnel system at our domestic group companies in April 2022 based on the concept of ''job-based human resource management'' that encourages each employee to take on challenges and grow as an individual. To realize Fujitsu's purpose and the personal purpose that each employee articulates through ''Purpose Carving,'' we fully overhauled our human resource and training systems so that both the company and employees will be able to grow together based on a relationship that fosters autonomy and trust. Under this job-based human resource management system, we offer the Fujitsu Career Ownership Program (FCOP), a set of programs that cultivate career ownership in individual employees and support growth and the tackling of new challenges.

As one example of FCOP in action, about 25% of our employees in Japan participate in the Career Cafe, a place for peers of the same generation to share ideas and receive new career inspiration. We also introduced a Career Ownership Assessment in FY2022 to determine the current level of an employee’s career ownership. One out of every five employees now utilizes this assessment. From April 2023, we also introduced LinkedIn Learning (*1) as a global learning platform. More than 80% of employees use this platform, which has fostered a culture of self- directed learning. Additionally, some one in 10 e mployees in Japan have been transferred through our in- house posting system as part of their own efforts in working toward desired positions. The introduction of in-house internships and internal side jobs also provides support for employees taking on new challenges, providing opportunities to gain various experiences that extend beyond our organization. Over 1,000 employees annually use our counselling system with in-house career counsellors. To further encourage career dialogue, we also provide mentoring opportunities with senior employees from other departments and have expanded training programs for supervisors to facilitate their skills for one-on-one career dialogues with employees. In these ways, the various FCOP programs have steadily increased employees’ awareness, understanding, and practice of career ownership.

These efforts will provide customers with the values of Uvance and modernization while strengthening the Fujitsu consulting services that will guide them. Fujitsu Innovation Circuit The Fujitsu Innovation Circuit is a program that seeks to make Fujitsu a place where anyone can rise to a challenge, where learning from challenges is a practical attitude, and where supporting those who are taking on challenges is a natural thing, all with the goal of creating “intrapreneurs” (in-house entrepreneurs) who will lead Fujitsu into the future and create the world we envision with Uvance. The Academy and Challenge programs, begun in November 2021, a re designed to foster intrapreneurs through the learning and practice of entrepreneurship. These programs are under the full supervision of Yasuhiro Yamakawa, Associate Professor of Entrepreneurship at Babson College in the United States.

This alignment fosters individual growth and maximizes the impact on the organization, customers and society. Connect features three key elements. The second element, in particular, involves regular one-on-one meetings between team members and managers. These meetings focus on providing feedback on individual performance reviews and future growth. Currently, these one-on-one meetings are held at least once a month for approximately 70% of our employees.

Performance reviews extend beyond mere results management, providing employees with feedback on whether they are acting in accordance with their individual role based on the Fujitsu Group’s Code of Conduct, the Fujitsu Way. Fujitsu highly values the realization of “Aspiration”, “Trust” and “Empathy” as the key values of the Fujitsu Way, which underpins Fujitsu’s medium- and long-term value structure. Accordingly, within the “Connect” system, employees are assessed on their “Impact”, “Behaviors” and “Learning & Growth” relative to achieving each organization’s vision and Fujitsu’s purpose. (See figure at right.) Additionally, to ensure comprehensive consideration during evaluations, “people discussions” are conducted within each organizational unit to discuss measures aimed at the future growth of each employee and to validate the evaluations. (3) Using evaluations for remuneration, assignments and upskilling support Using the evaluation results in considerations of remuneration, assignments and upskilling support enables us to create mechanisms that ensure consistent personnel management and maximize the growth both of individuals and the organization. This, in turn, can have a significant impact on the organization, customers and society at large. Employee Benefits Program The Fujitsu Group has programs in place that are suited to the lifestyles of employees and their families and are designed to enable them to achieve a sense of well-being. As part of the trend toward more diverse and flexible ways of working, and to allow employees to make their own choices, Fujitsu introduced the ”F Life+” cafeteria plan(*3). In line with the belief that active work, challenges and personal growth for every employee will lead to growth and development for the company, we have established various incentives to provide medium- to long-term motivation. These include a defined contribution pension plan, an employee shareholding association, a property accumulation savings plan, and group insurance benefits.

The new version puts in place more advanced measures that reflect both employee feedback and issues that arose when the original Work Life Shift was implemented. 1. Practical Hybrid Work and the Evolution to “Experience Place” As we look towards a post-COVID future, the office is evolving from the workplace of the past to an “experience place” that offers experiences only available at the office. New ways of using the office provide greater collaboration through real communication as we transition to a true hybrid work style that combines the real with the virtual. 2. Evolution of Work Styles for a DX Corporation At Fujitsu, we are making the value of the various experiences gained from putting hybrid work into practice visible as data as we move towards a work style that boosts productivity while allowing for greater creativity. We are also further stepping up our collaborations with other corporations and local governments who support the Work Life Shift concept and contributing to the resolution of problems for our customers and the community more broadly. 3. Enabling Work-Life Synergies By leveraging flexible work styles to make workers’ home lives more fulfilling, we are generating synergies and promoting new value creation, as well as achieving greater engagement and improving the well-being of all our employees. FUJITSU-PUBLIC @Fujitsu 2024 Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 5-2-4-2 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 157 ===== Fujitsu Telework System In April 2017, F ujitsu formally introduced a telework system that allows for flexible ways of working that are not tied to a specific location. This system is available to all 35,000 Fujitsu parent company employees in Japan and includes working from home or a satellite office as well as working during business trips. The telework system facilitates business continuity in emergency situations such as the spread of infectious diseases and during natural disasters, providing for work innovations such as holding online meetings and digitizing written materials. It also provides an environment that makes it easier for employees with other commitments, such as raising children or caring for relatives, to continue working, helping Fujitsu to support and retain valuable personnel. Goals of the System Initiatives Aimed at Reducing Long Working Hours The Fujitsu Group aims to improve the well-being and productivity of every employee through a variety of initiatives aimed at reducing long working hours. By promoting Work Life Shift, we aim to implement practical hybrid work modes that combine real and virtual work to suit job goals, thereby improving productivity and creativity in work styles that create new value. Examples of specific initiatives aimed at reducing long working hours: To boost individual productivity and maximize the benefits of team work To build an environment that supports continued participation by a diverse range of staff To ensure business continuity and rapid responses to disasters Creating mechanisms to balance the workload across each day (canceling core time in flex time systems and utilizing breaks and restarts) Promoting refresher periods (setting a recommended number of annual leave days to suit the summer and New Year breaks) Using push notifications relating to working hours (sending alert e-mails regarding overtime work, displaying pop-up messages in punch in/out systems regarding health and communications for people working long hours) FUJITSU-PUBLIC @Fujitsu 2024 Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 5-2-4-3 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 158 ===== Support for a Healthy Work-Life Balance Fujitsu and its domestic Group companies aim to generate new forms of value through Work- Life Synergies. We support each employee’s efforts to enrich their career with initiatives in areas such as childcare and nursing care. 1. Childcare 2.Nursing care Improving management (management education on working hours) Childcare leave (available until the day prior to the child’s 1s t birthday, but extendable until the first April 20th following the child’s 2nd birthday depending on the availability of day care) Childbirth support leave (up to 20 days (4 weeks) can be taken by spouses or partners up to 8 weeks before or after the birth of the child) Use of annual leave is permitted during childcare leave (up to 20 days (4 weeks) can be taken) Child illness/injury leave (to provide nursing care, accompany the child for vaccinations or health checks, take part in school events, etc.) Childcare reduced working hours system (up to March 31 in Year 6 of elementary school; can reduce by a maximum of 2 hours per day) Establishment of corporate childcare centers Subsidies for babysitting service expenses Remote working (support for raising a disabled child, single parents, or families where a spouse is posted overseas) Cafeteria Plan (can be used to purchase childcare products such as diapers and breast pumps, or for kindergarten or after-school care fees) Leave for nursing care and preparing for nursing care (up to 1 y ear in total per family) Family care leave (up to 20 days (4 weeks) available) Care giving reduced working hours system (until the issue requiring care is resolved) FUJITSU-PUBLIC @Fujitsu 2024 Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 5-2-4-4 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 159 ===== VOICE Program The Fujitsu Group launched the VOICE Program in October 2020, as a project to ''not only listen  indirectly to customers' ‘voices’, but also listen more directly and more oùten'' as well as to ''directly link the opinions of the Fujitsu Group’s 130,000 employees to management''. The  concept of VOICE is symbolized by the slogan ''change one's voice into a force and create a  wind of change''. This is an activity that aims to heighten corporate competitiveness by  collecting the ‘voices’ of customers and employees and – by using them to speed up decision- making in business activities – thereby change behavior, raise awareness, and generate  encounters.  As part of eùforts to enhance the workplace environment, we periodically conduct surveys  related to Work Life Shiùt and the results are reflected in a range of measures that leverage the  VOICE program, such as business process reforms and the review of systems and operations.  This leads to improvements in employee experience and employee engagement. Measures to Enhance Communication Labor Relations Fujitsu has a union shop agreement with the Fujitsu Labor Union. Based on this, we hold  discussions on various conditions of employment conditions and explain management policies  and business conditions, along with business reorganization and other matters, to employees  through regular and ad hoc meetings such as the Labor Council or Productivity Council. These  agreements also stipulate the collective bargaining rights of the union. In Europe, the Fujitsu European Labor Relations Council Annual General Meeting has taken  place every year since 2000, with the overall ùinancial conditions of the Fujitsu Group and other  issues shared with employee representatives from Fujitsu Group companies. Fujitsu has established a consultation service as a contact point for queries to the Human  Resources and Administration Units. This is part of a structure that is designed to make it easy  for employees to seek guidance on human resource and administrative programs.

As communities become more diverse, this network offers spontaneous forms of communication for employees that extends beyond mere interchanges within the organization, encouraging new business plans, secondary jobs and workations, and allowing exchanges of information on careers in the life sphere, such as child- raising and caring. It is also used by employees to discuss opinions and aspirations circulating in the community, such as staff management policies and the environment.

That way, we can apply the survey outcomes to our management practices in a timely way. The scores for psychological safety in these surveys improved by 6 points in Japan and by 5 points internationally between June 2021 and No vember 2023. 1. Promoting the project through design concepts This project poses the question of how we can boost the psychological safety of both individuals and teams and then maintain that state to promote innovation. It also puts forward the overall project design and the communication solutions as design concepts. Promoting the project through design concepts leverages the diversity of the design team members so that problems can be solved creatively from the perspective of employees. 2.Regular online events In the roughly 3 years since 2021, w e have held 7 online psychological safety events, with more than 2,700 employees taking part. Senior executives and Directors have taken to the stage at these events with the aim of inspiring confidence that we take psychological safety seriously at the highest levels and are actively engaged. Through these events, we have received feedback on psychological safety from more than 600 participants, and we are using this information for qualitative analysis. 3.Formulation of a unique model for improving psychological safety Based on a range of survey data, including engagement surveys, and other employee feedback, Fujitsu has formulated its own original psychological safety improvement model and activity guidelines. 4.Release of the free “Fujitsu Psychological Safety Playbook” To promote better understanding and behavioral change among employees around psychological safety, we released a “Playbook” within the company to provide a basic understanding and improvement models. The Playbook has now been viewed over 7,000 times in all. In May 2024, we updated the content of the Playbook released internally with the aim of providing practical tips for everyone who works in corporate bodies that are engaged in human capital management and cultural innovation.

At the Sustainability Management Committee that meets every six  months, committee members check the progress of activities and the achievement status of targets,  deliberate on new activities and report the results to the management council and the Board of  Directors.  In Japan, health management is led by the Chief Health Officer (CHO). The CHO heads the Health  Management Oice, which consists of the Employee Success Unit, the Health Promotion Unit and the  Fujitsu Health Insurance Society. The Health Management Oice holds regular meetings twice a month  to analyze health-related data and issues, set targets and indicators, draw up plans, carry out measures  and manage, evaluate and improve progress. The results are regularly reported to the CHO. The Health  Management Oice plays a central role in the implementation of measures, working together with the  Health and Safety Committees in offices and Group companies, occupational health physicians and  industrial health and safety staff to urge organizations (division heads, managers, Work Environment  Improvement Support Staff) and individuals (employees and their families) to action.  Two meetings have been established to promote health management initiatives: the Central Health  and Safety Committee and the Health Management Cooperation Council. The Central Health and  Safety Committee reflects the opinions of employees by discussing issues and sharing information  with the representatives of labor unions and the representatives from offices and divisions. At the  Health Management Cooperation Council, the Health Management Oice and corporate, research and  business divisions share information in both directions about Fujitsu's health management initiatives  and about health management-related business initiatives being carried out by research and business  divisions. They encourage the adoption of health management in business while promoting the  application of ICT (such as in demonstration experiments).

To that end, we have established our goal for FY2023, which is being implemented in all regions and  Group companies.  In Japan, under our aim of creating an environment where all employees can work positively and healthily,  we set five indicators about improving productivity, invigorating individuals and organizations, and  enhancing human resource retention to serve as final health-related evaluation indicators. To improve  and reinforce each indicator, we created a health management strategy map. We are tackling the areas  representing the five priority measures on the map, namely  1.

An analysis of teleworking rates, highly-stressed persons and health risks shows that the number of  highly-stressed persons decreases as the rate of teleworking increases. However there is a U-shaped  relationship between overall health risks and teleworking rates. Workload control risks and workplace  support risks both increase for the group with low teleworking rates. Workload control risks decrease  as the rate of teleworking increases, but when the teleworking rate exceeds 90%, workplace support  risk increases. (Graph 1)  An analysis of long overtime hours, highly-stressed persons and health risks shows that workload control  risks and overall health risks increase with longer overtime hours. (Graph 2) The results of this analysis  show that stress and health risks can be reduced by creating a hybrid work system by combining the  flexible use of time and locations based on work contents and purpose and lifestyles that teleworking  offers with the effective use of real-life communication at the office, and by coupling the hybrid work  system with a reduction in overtime hours through the proactive application of flexible work structures  such as flextime and discretionary systems. Thus we will further promote Work Life Shit as a new  working style that allows employees to display even higher productivity and continue to innovate.  These kinds of analysis results are released to all employees through the portal site and internal  newsletters along with health dynamics data (health examination data, leaves of absence, etc.) and  stress check results.

We promote regular additional  screenings for stomach cancer, colorectal cancer, and prostate cancer when employees undergo legally  prescribed health checkups, based on age group. In collaboration with the Fujitsu Health Insurance  Society, we conduct and support the expenses for gynecological examinations (cervical cancer and  breast cancer) for all female employees. In addition, to screen for stomach cancer, the Fujitsu Health  Insurance Society runs tests for Helicobacter pylori for 35-year-olds and conducts in-depth  examinations on those who test positive.  Additionally, we hold “Cancer Prevention and Support for Balancing Work and Treatment” e-learning  seminars for all group employees in order to equip them with accurate knowledge about cancer, and  to lead to prevention through improvement of lifestyle habits, as well as early detection and treatment  through health checkups. We also provide e-learning materials to employees’ families in cooperation  with the Fujitsu Health Insurance Society.  Fujitsu and its domestic Group companies  provide support for independent health  management by carrying out health  checkup in accordance with legally  mandated health examination items, with  additional items by age group, as well as  offering checkup results via online systems  and providing information such as health  risks and changes over time. In addition,  with regard to employees who have   abnormal findings after receiving checkups, we aim to improve their lifestyle habits, and provide  thorough medical checkups and consultations, through health guidance and medical examination  recommendations supplied by occupational health physicians and occupational health staff. For  employees who have been diagnosed as needing treatment due to their test results, the Fujitsu  Health Insurance Society monitors their medical prescriptions for three months to prevent their  post-diagnosis condition from worsening, and recommends checkups for employees who have not  undergone treatment, which leads to appropriate medical care. In addition, family members of  employees (spouses of those enrolled in the Fujitsu Health Insurance Society, and family members  40 years of age and older) are able to undergo the same health checkups as employees (including  cancer screenings).

Therefore we have set it as an  important health issue and we hold activities such as dental examinations and preventive dentistry  seminars to promote oral and dental health. Over the years, the dental department within the Fujitsu  Clinic has been supporting the oral and dental health of employees through providing treatment for  dental caries, assessing factors and risks for decay and periodontal diseases in providing preventive  care. In September 2023, the dental clinic was reorganized as a prevention-focused dental clinic  updates to existing equipment and services. Information on oral and dental health is given via oral health  education within our clinical practice.  At Fujitsu and its domestic Group  companies, through health consultations,  employment support and recurrence  prevention for those with mental health  issues, and mental health education  provided by occupational health staff at  each office, we support employees and  workplaces, which leads to improved  mental health. Furthermore, we have full-  time psychiatrists and licensed  psychologists on staff to offer counseling  during working hours, providing a system for receiving professional support within the company.  Health consultations and counseling can also be accessed online, creating a structure where they  are available from anywhere, including when working from home. The Fujitsu Health Insurance  Society also provides health consultations and counseling over the phone and online so that  employees and their families can easily consult them. We set up a page on our Intranet with  comprehensive information on mental health to promote mental well-being for employees’ career  longevity, such as a consultation desk, mental health relevant contents, in-house programs for  mental health disorders, and information on stress checks.  In a system unique to the Fujitsu Group, Work Environment Improvement Support Staff are  appointed and placed at each workplace to promote the creation of work environments where  employees can work positively and healthily. The Support Staff work together with managers to  solve work management challenges, detect poor health quickly based on employee performance  and daily communication with them and to respond at an early stage by coordinating with the Health  Promotion Unit and Human Resources Unit.  For stress checks, in addition to supporting employee self-care through checkups, we provide  feedback to management and senior staff members by integrating organizational analysis results  with engagement surveys and other internal studies, then synchronizing these efforts with Work  Life Shit initiatives, which leads to better working environments. In addition, for workplaces with  high levels of health risk and workplaces with many employees who have been evaluated as highly  stressed, we offer stress management education and workshops for creating healthy workplaces to  provide support for reducing employee stress factors and energizing the places where they work.

Health literacy and health awareness improvement  Through various kinds of health education such as health guidance, e-learning, training for managers  and company-wide seminars, through various events about exercise, diet and smoking, and by sharing  information through internal newsletters and portal sites, we aim to improve employees' health literacy  and health awareness and form healthy habits.  Assessment of health literacy  Using the scale of Communicative and Critical Health Literacy (CCHL), employees are assessed  for their average score in each of the five categories on a five-point scale ranging from strongly  disagree to strongly agree: ability to collect information (ability to gather information from various  sources from newspapers, to books, TV, and the Internet, etc.), ability to select information (ability  to find information one is looking for from a lot of information), ability to convey information  (ability to understand and convey information to others), ability to determine information (ability  to determine the credibility of information), and ability to make decisions (ability to plan or make  decisions for health improvement based on the information).

In FY2023, e-learning was conducted on the topic of achieving health starting with dental and oral health, where 35,501 employees in Japan participated. In the post- learning survey, 93% of participants who responded said that the learning was helpful. ⚫ Regular employees: Receive education about self-care when joining the company or changing jobs through e-learning. ⚫ Managers: Receive education about their subordinates' mental healthcare when appointed as managers and once every three years as part of their people management education. ⚫ Company-wide seminars: Seminars are broadcast to all Group company employees in Japan about topics such as exercise, nutrition, diet, smoking and women's health. In FY2023, an average of 900 employees participated in live seminars, with 99% of participants who responded to the post-seminar survey said that it was helpful. ⚫ Office seminars: Seminars are held on themes such as mental health and health promotion, based on the issues faced by each office. * Refer to FY2023 Performance: Health Education for more details Initiatives Post-Health Education  To promote internalizing the contents learned in FY2022 on physical activity and lower body  health as seen from lower body pain and encourage employees to incorporate them into their  everyday practice, we provide physical health exams and multiple assessments on body  composition, locomotive syndrome, and bone density at health seminars under the theme of long- term health management. We hope to provide a variety of programs that will help each employee  develop healthy behaviors that suit their individual needs.

Participants compete on an individual and team basis with the average number of steps walked in a month using a smartphone app. There are individual and team incentives for the employees with the highest average number of steps, teams that achieve 6,000 average steps in a day, teams that achieve 8,000 steps daily and other metrics. ⚫ A nutrition education event, “Let’s Learn About Food Together Day” We have declared the 19th of every month to be Food Education Day. In addition to introducing healthy recipes using seasonal ingredients and information about health effects via email newsletters, we prepare special menu items using those ingredients at the employee cafeterias all over Japan, and work to improve employee awareness of what they eat. * Refer to FY2023 Performance: Health Events for more details Work environment development  ⚫ Reiwa Version of Billy’s Bootcamp with Fujitsu Sports With working from home becoming mainstream under Work Life Shit, Fujitsu and Fujitsu Health Insurance Society together launched a sports event via an online service hosted by RIZAP and athletes of Fujitsu Sports to encourage mental and physical reset, promote an active lifestyle and approach employees without a workout routine, with the goal to promote health maintenance among employees. The Fujitsu Group prepared a “Health  Report Card” that visualizes data about the  status of employee health on a division and  company basis and the status of health  improvement initiatives compared to the  Group as a whole. It provides this card to  management as feedback along with  employee engagement surveys and stress  check group analysis results, and the  management works together with the  workplace to develop the working  environment while sharing employee  Comprehensive mental health website  Sample Health Report Card  We also aim to improve the work-life balance and productivity of every individual employee by  implementing a variety of measures to reduce long working hours. By promoting Work Life Shit, we have  developed structures that support diverse working styles, taking teleworking as a basis and actively  adopting flexible working arrangements such as flextime and discretionary work systems.

Furthermore, to support efforts by smokers to quit smoking, we also hold seminars so that employees  will accurately understand the health effects of smoking, and provide support and subsidies for  treatment to quit smoking. In addition, information on smoking is aggregated on the intranet, and a  consultation desk for treatment and other matters has been established. On World No Tobacco Day in  May, we send out messages from industrial physicians to raise awareness of smoking cessation  throughout the Group.  Health Initiatives for Female Employees  For health issues specific to women, we provide education, share information and have established a  dedicated consultation window to raise women’s health awareness and generate concern and  understanding for health issues that women face. We also implement or support the costs of screening  for cancers specific to women, all of which is aimed at driving the creation of a workplace where women  can work positively.  ⚫ In coordination with our diversity, equity and inclusion measures, we make time for women- specific health issues at seminars about balancing childcare and work that are held for employees returning from childcare leave and supervisors with employees raising children under them. ⚫ Gynecological examinations (cervical cancer and breast cancer screening) are conducted for all female employees and employees can be examined at no personal cost. They can choose to undergo the examination as a set together with their company’s mandatory health examination, or visit a contracted medical institution or visit their regular doctor for an examination. ⚫ A women’s health portal site has been set up on the intranet to disseminate information on different themes about women’s health (such as hormones, life planning, menopause, and cancer), seminars held, archives of past seminars and a women’s health consultation window. ⚫ We broadcast seminars on women’s health to all Group employees online to coincide with Pink Ribbon Day Week in March. By targeting all employees and not just female employees, we help all employees  to take an interest in and have correct knowledge about female-specific health issues. This  encourages the development of a work environment easy for women to work in and supports the  active participation of female employees.

Infectious Disease Countermeasures  Fujitsu and its domestic Group companies actively engage in countermeasures to keep employees safe  from various infectious diseases by establishing health consultation services and dispensing information,  among other initiatives. As preventative measures against infectious diseases, we give seasonal  influenza vaccinations at companies, in addition to giving vaccinations to employees stationed overseas  which are recommended in each place they will be staying (at company expense). With regard to the  issue of rubella, which has been growing in recent years, we are cooperating with local governments to  conduct education and public awareness campaigns at offices.  The fundamental idea at Fujitsu and its domestic Group  companies is that employees should undergo proper  treatment, then return to work after recovery. We have  established various leave systems and income support  mechanisms so that employees can have peace of mind and  devote themselves to medical treatment. We provide  support from medical staff while an employee is on leave, so  that they can make a smooth return to work. When they  return, we conduct joint discussions with the occupational  health physician (occupational health staff), HR, the  employee’s department head, and the employee themselves,  and review their post-return work duties and employment  considerations.  In order to provide support for employee treatment while  they are on leave and for their return to work, we offer a  guidebook aimed at the employee and their supporting department head and family members. Fujitsu  provides the Return to Work Guide for employees to consult as well as for occupational health  physicians at other companies who provide return to work support (occupational healthcare staff),  HR departments, and department heads.

In addition,  we accept occupational health physicians, medical students, nursing students and others for training  within the company, and contribute to the human resources development of occupational health staff.  ⚫ Sharing cancer e-learning materials with parties outside the company Through the Cancer Countermeasure Corporate Action project conducted by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare the materials used in the ''Cancer Prevention and Support for Balancing Work and Treatment'' e-learning seminars held for all Fujitsu and all Group employees in FY2019 are being provided to the project's partner companies and organizations. As of the end of FY2022, 44,100 persons had attended the seminar. ⚫ Cooperating to measure the effectiveness of cancer screening Fujitsu is collaborating with specially-appointed Professor Nakagawa of the University of Tokyo Hospital and the National Cancer Center in a demonstration to measure the effectiveness of cancer screening through receptor analysis. This demonstration illustrates a difference of 7.5 million yen in medical expenses over the four-year period between early stage cancer and advanced cancer. In FY2021, a total of 22,000 Fujitsu employees underwent fecal occult blood tests for colon cancer screening, 4% underwent detailed examinations, and 12 were found to have early-stage cancer. ⚫ The total cost of colon cancer screening and detailed examination was 43 million yen. If the 12 people were to be diagnosed with advanced cancer through a medical examination, the total medical expenses for four years would be about 90 million yen. The early screening has economic merit as it saved 47 million yen in medical expenses. Aside from the cost aspect, the early detection and treatment of cancer through cancer screening also minimizes productivity loss as a result of sick leave. ⚫ Joint development of a Migraine Improvement program with the Global Patient Advocacy Coalition of the International Headache Society (IHS-GPAC) * Refer to FY2023 Performance: Health Management Promotion and Social Contributions for other public announcements.

In addition, these health and safety management organizations conduct regular workplace patrols, survey for potentially dangerous areas or causes of health hazards and factors based on a workplace inspection checklist, and report on improvements, and conduct risk assessments. They also post response methods on each business site’s intranet as a preparatory measure for emergencies. The Human Resources Unit has a workplace management inquiry system and workflow for promptly reporting workplace accidents, and responds to inquiries and consultations from employees at any time. In the Europe, Americas, Asia Pacific regions and at the Global Delivery Center, we hold health and safety leadership forums three times a year for the purposes of monitoring and examining occupational health and safety activities at the regional and national levels, as well as report on strategic goals, achievements and ongoing improvements in occupational health and safety at the regional and national level to foster a culture that does not tolerate occupational accidents in the workplace.

The details of our initiatives aimed at improving employee safety and health are reported and shared with the Sustainability Management Committee, which meets semi-annually. Occupational Health and Safety Training We provide health and safety training, as well as health education that raises health awareness, for the entire Group and for the unique environments at each office. In particular, industrial physicians and counselors send messages as necessary in regard to topics such as lifestyle diseases and various vaccinations, and physical and mental health maintenance in order to raise employee awareness. We also utilize Fujitsu Learning Experience to create an environment where anyone, at a global level, can learn anytime with initiatives suited to the circumstances of each region and country. In Japan, health and safety education is provided via e-learning to new employees of Fujitsu or Group companies to acquire useful basic knowledge on occupational accident prevention and self-management of health (2,196 p eople/year complete the course). In the Europe region and at the Global Delivery Center, online training (Safety Awareness World, City Safety Challenge) allows employees to experience various work environments around the world for the purpose of understanding and properly managing workplace health and safety risks. This training also contributes to spreading the use of support tools aimed at ensuring safety at all workplaces. We also conduct specific training and campaigns in specific countries- for example, virtual reality fire safety training in Poland and a workplace health and safety module in Australia that received the LearnX 2023 Platinum Award. In Hong Kong, we held a talk session in July 2023 on complications from COVID-19 in fection and conducted a stretching class using a meditative sound bath in December 2023. In Taiwan, we held workshops on occupational health three times during the year, conducted workplace safety and health activities in line with the Taiwanese government's regulations, and obtained the Healthy Workplace Certification-Health Promotion Mark from the Health Promotion Administration (MOHW-HPA).

For the 2023 World Day for Safety and Health at Work, we delivered a message to all employees about the importance of health and safety and a safe and healthy work environment. In the Europe region, the Americas region, the Asia Pacific region, and at the Global Delivery Center, we conducted awareness campaigns on reporting hazards, accidents and incidents, and provided a variety of guidance for challenges in working from home and shift work, workplace adjustments, ensuring safety in abnormal weather conditions, occupational stress, safe lifting and working alone. To support employees on overseas business trips, we have also introduced risk assessments and provide guidance to ensure employee safety when overseas. In addition, we have in place occupational safety and health support tools for employees and conduct mock training in preparation for emergency situations (terrorist threats, pandemics, extreme weather events, fires, etc.). Initiatives for Obtaining International Occupational Health and Safety Certifications, and External Evaluations The international standard of ISO 45001 certification for occupational health and safety management (OH&S) has been obtained by some Group companies in Japan and by Group companies in the UK, Ireland, France, Spain, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, and Portugal, and in fiscal 2023, Group companies in India and Estonia newly gained certification. In addition, a team of occupational health and safety experts who are members of IOSH (Institution of Occupational Safety and Health) with training as ISO45001 lead auditors have been deployed in various overseas regions outside Japan to support a diverse workforce. For external evaluations, we were recognized for our efforts to maintain and provide a healthy and safe working environment, and received the Work Environment Award from the Estonian Labour Inspectorate and the International Safety Award from the British Safety Council. We also participate in the Global Electronics Council’s Sustainability Technical Committee and the IOSH’s (Institution of Occupational Safety and Health’s) Business Leaders Forum.

(*1) ISO14001 ： Environmental Management Systems (EMS) standard determined by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Certification is granted to environmentally conscious organizations that develop systems for ongoing reductions in their environmental footprint. Fujitsu Group’s EMS Fujitsu Group has constructed EMS based on the ISO 14001 in ternational standard and is promoting environmental improvement activities across the Group. After acquiring ISO 14001 certification for consolidated subsidiaries in Japan at the end of FY 2004, we expanded this effort to include overseas subsidiaries and acquired global integrated certification at the end of FY 2005. Subsequently, the overseas subsidiaries switched to individual certification. Environmental Management Framework In April 2020, Fujitsu Group set up the Sustainability Management Committee, which leads the charge for management which takes sustainability initiatives into account. The Sustainability Management Committee has established major sustainability issues which are common globally (Global Responsible Business: GRB) and is working to address them, and the environment is one of those to be addressed. In order to promote environmental activities, we consider medium- and long-term issues, formulate policies, share business risks and opportunities due to climate change, consider ways to respond, and report regularly to the Sustainability Management Committee in order to improve EMS and strengthen governance. Based on that, final approvals on environmental management at the Fujitsu Group are made at meetings of the Management Council. We have in place environmental organizations in charge of specific issues, composed of relevant parties that go beyond the framework of business groups and business units.

For example, the committee determines the directions to be taken for reduction of energy consumption and CO emissions, countermeasure for environmental risk, and other environmental medium-to-long term visions. The Sustainability Management Committee also conducts environmental management reviews and is exercising approval authority for the Fujitsu Group Environmental Action Plan. Organizations in charge of issue-specific targets (e.g., energy, greenhouse gases, waste, water) address those matters professionally, identify areas for improvement based on performance data, consider and promote targets in the Environmental Action Plan, and check the progress of the targets. After receiving progress reports from the organizations, the Environmental Management Controller approves the status of activities and suggestions of future focuses, etc., and instructs all organizations to implement the necessary initiatives. To further disseminate these activities and improve skills, we continually provide environmental training/ education and annual briefing on topics such as climate change, resources (including water) and waste.

In addition to the Risk Management & Compliance Committee,  which reports directly to the Board of Directors, and Risk Management & Compliance Officers at each  Fujitsu division and Group company in Japan and overseas, we have regional Risk Management &  Compliance Committees, to build a structure where these organizations cooperate with each other to  promote risk management and compliance throughout the Fujitsu Group, both in terms of preventing  potential risks and responding to risks that have emerged. The Committee identifies, analyzes, and  assesses key risks associated with the business activities of each Fujitsu division and Group company  in Japan and overseas (focusing on 33 risks considered to be important to the Group), and formulates  and reviews the countermeasures for these risks after confirming the status of countermeasures for  avoiding, mitigating, transferring, or retaining them. The Committee makes regular reports to the  Board of Directors about key risks that have been identified, analyzed and assessed, using methods  such as the creation of visualized rankings and maps which take the degree of impact and likelihood  of occurrence into account. In addition, we have put response processes into place in the event that  risks become tangible, despite the implementation of various measures. Each division and Group  company will immediately report to the Risk Management & Compliance Committee about any key  risks that become tangible, such as natural disasters, accidents, product accidents or failures, system  or service problems, compliance violations such as fraud, information security incidents, or  environmental problems.  We also leverage the group’s Environmental Management System (EMS), which is based on ISO14001,  for minimizing risks to the environment through continuous improvements.   Risk Management > Environmental Management System > Response to Environmental Risks  Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 5-3-1-13 @Fujitsu 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 215 ===== Efforts to Minimize Risks to the Environment  Dealing with Risks Related to Climate Change  There is a possibility of significant impacts on our business continuity from increases in the frequency  and effects of natural disasters as a result of recent climate changes. For that reason, we have  formulated a business continuity plan and are devoting effort to continually revising and improving  the plan.  In addition to risks such as implementation of stricter regulations for greenhouse gas emissions and a  carbon tax, there is demand from customers and society for contribution to carbon neutral. This  creates a risk of increasing the energy cost incurred by the Fujitsu Group, as well as the cost required  to comply with regulations related to measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, if  climate change countermeasures are insufficient, there is a risk of harm to our corporate reputation or  a disadvantage at bidding.    In order to minimize these risks, we are conducting short-term, medium-term and long-term risk  analysis/response within our company-wide risk management structure. As the trend toward carbon  neutrality in the global community as a measure against climate change, we have obtained net-zero  target certification from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). We will further raise the 1.5°C level  we acquired in fiscal 2021 and aim for net-zero by FY 2040.    In accordance with the recommendations issued by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial  Disclosures (TCFD) in 2017, the Fujitsu Group analyzes and discloses risks associated with climate  change that may have an impact on its business and financial strategies.

The Fujitsu Group conducts assessments of and monitors potential water risks for direct  operations sites and supply chains.  Specifically, while using tools and databases provided by NGOs and national and local governments,  we identify water stress conditions and natural disaster risks in regions where our business sites are  located in accordance with RCP 4.5 (intermediate stabilization scenario) from among the emissions  scenarios defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). We then  comprehensively assess the water risk at each site by analyzing how important water use is in the  business activities of each operations base, and we confirm the level of compliance in a variety of  activities such as the reduction of water intake, measures to reduce pollution in wastewater, business  continuity management (BCM) systems, and others. For the supply chain, we also assess our suppliers'  flood preparedness and other water risks based on the supply chain BCM surveys, field surveys  conducted according to the Responsible Business Alliance's (RBA) code of conduct and the CDP  Supply Chain Program.

We recover and recycle chemicals used in  production processes, instead of discharging them into wastewater. We are also working to properly  manage and reduce discharge of harmful substances and pollutants by ensuring appropriate chemical  use, preventing chemical leaks and penetration, and properly managing the operations of water  treatment and purification facilities, among other measures.  Preventing Air Pollution  We have set voluntary control values that are more stringent than legally mandated emissions  standards in order to prevent air pollution and limit acid rain. Regular measurement and monitoring  are conducted based on these controls. Efforts are also made to appropriately process dust and soot,  sulfur oxide, nitrogen oxide, and other harmful substances, and reduce emissions through measures  including combustion management at facilities that produce soot and smoke, use of fuels with low  sulfur content, and managing the operations of exhaust gas processing equipment. Furthermore, we  have installed activated carbon adsorption treatment equipment and are reducing our atmospheric  emissions of organic solvent vapors containing substances like VOCs. Moreover, with the enactment in  April 2015 of the Act on Rational Use and Proper Management of Fluorocarbons, we have set in-house  stipulations and striven for proper management of specified products (commercial refrigerators and  air conditioners containing fluorocarbon refrigerants) while working to identify the volume of our  fluorocarbon leakage.  In addition, emission of dioxins has been prevented by suspending use of all in-house incineration  facilities as of January 2000.  Preventing Destruction of the Ozone Layer  Since fluorocarbons not only destroy the ozone layer but also cause global warming, we have totally  eliminated the use of ozone-depleting substances in manufacturing processes (parts cleaning and  solvents) by introducing precision water cleaning systems and no-clean soldering technology. On the  other hand, with regard to fluorocarbons for refrigerants used in air conditioning facilities (freezers,  etc.), we are switching to non-fluorocarbons when equipment is renewed, and are working to  appropriately manage and dispose of Class I specified products in accordance with the Fluorocarbons  Emission Control Act.   In addition, the annual confirmation of the amount of leakage in the calculation of fluorocarbons  indicates that it is less than 1,000 t-CO2 (not subject to reporting to the minister in charge) for FY2023.

Also, we regularly carry out on-site audits in order to  confirm that subcontractors are appropriately handling the waste processing tasks we entrust to  them. As part of our efforts to reduce waste, we are promoting the reuse of certain plastic trays in  cooperation with a vendor that is working to reuse plastic trays and convert them into recyclable  materials.  Environmental Liabilities  In properly assessing the Fujitsu Group’s expected future environmental liabilities, and communicating  our integrity and corporate stance of not deferring our liabilities, we have recorded liabilities of 2.50  billion yen in soil pollution cleanup costs, high-level polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) waste disposal  costs, and asbestos processing costs during facilities demolition, which is the amount we calculate, as  of the end of FY2023, to be necessary for the Fujitsu Group to conduct these tasks domestically in the  next fiscal year and beyond.  Conserving Biodiversity  In recent years, risks involving the natural environment have been recognized as serious global risks.  This necessitates the disclosure of relevant information disclosure by companies, and toward this end,  the Task Force on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) is considering an information disclosure  framework.  If the Fujitsu Group fails to appropriately respond to information disclosure in accordance with the  TNFD, its corporate reputation may decline and its ability to procure funds may be affected.

The Group has elected to fast-track its previous commitment to achieve “zero CO  emissions within the Group by FY2050”, instead bringing forward committed Vision by 20 years to FY2030. The Group has set the additional target of reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions (*1) throughout the value chain by 2040. *1 Net-zero greenhouse gas emissions: Reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 90% in the target year in comparison to the base year, and re-absorbing remaining emissions (of 10% or l ess) from the atmosphere through direct air capture (DAC) technologies or by planting trees. The Importance of Responding to Climate Change The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report “Global Warming of 1.5° C“ articulated the need to limit warming to 1.5 ° C above pre-industrial levels and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. With social roles expanding and additional demands placed on companies to tackle climate change, in October 2021 the Sc ience Based Target Initiative (SBTi) (*2) launched the world’s first Net-Zero Standard for companies to set net-zero strategies. In order to resolve issues related to climate change, the Fujitsu Group decided to revise its previous commitment to ''zero CO  emissions by 2050'', pursuing instead a more ambitious vision that requires the Group to look beyond social trends and become the very embodiment of a leading SX company that delivers carbon neutrality. 2 2 Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 5-3-2-1 @Fujitsu 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 233 ===== The Fujitsu Group Environmental Vision comprises three pillars, namely, Value chain: Achieve net-zero emissions, Mitigation: Contribute to a carbon-neutral society, and Adaptation: Contribute to climate change adaptation measures.

It also reports on the results of its activities to the Board of Directors at meetings of the Executive Management Council. In October 2020, the committee made a key decision by revising the Fujitsu Group GHG reduction target (SBT) from 2.0°C to 1.5° C. In April 2021, th e new target was validated as 1.5° C-aligned to the SBTi. In October 2021, the r esults of scenario analyses using two external scenarios, one for 1.5° C and the other for 4°C, were reported to the Sustainability Management Committee. The findings prompted lively discussion among the committee members on topics such as the need to discuss management strategies, the selection of key solutions, and the measurement of impacts once solutions are provided. Within the company-wide risk management regime and with oversight by the Board of Directors, the Risk Management & Compliance Committee, chaired by the CEO, conducts risk analysis and implements responses for the entire Group, including on issues relating to climate change. This committee is also the ultimate decision-making body for risk management and reports regularly to the Board of Directors regarding major risks that have been identified, analyzed, and assessed.

The analyses studied businesses likely to be impacted by climate change in the following areas: Sustainable Manufacturing (sectors studied: petrochemicals, automotive, foods, electronic device-related businesses), Trusted Society (sectors studied: public sector, transportation, energy-related businesses), and Hybrid IT (sector studied: datacenter-related businesses). FUJITSU-PUBLIC 5-3-2-15 @Fujitsu 2024 Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 247 ===== Analysis Steps and Details The analysis was conducted in 4 steps: assessment of risk severity, definition of scenarios, evaluation of impacts on business, and discussion of countermeasures. We began by organizing the risks and opportunities for the target businesses based on data such as the TCFD recommendations and external reports. We also conducted workshops to look at the qualitative aspects of business impacts stemming from each risk and opportunity item from the perspectives of Fujitsu and industry generally. We rated the severity of each risk or opportunity as “High”, “Medium” or “Low”. We then considered the future changes in each of the items classified as having a “High” severity and defined our scenarios using data from agencies such as the IPCC, IEA, and the Ministry of the Environment, together with the evidence provided in various reports. Specifically, we held an executive input session to consider global outlooks for 2050 given temperature rises of 1.5° C and 4°C, and then went on to consider the global outlook for each of the target industries, using tools such as Five Forces analysis. (See below for the 1.5° C global outlook.) Global outlook of a 1.5° C “carbon-neutral world in 2050” FUJITSU-PUBLIC 5-3-2-16 @Fujitsu 2024 Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 248 ===== To look at the impacts on business, we then tentatively calculated the qualitative gap between the scenarios and our existing strategies and plans with respect to risks and opportunities. For Hybrid IT (sector studied: datacenter-related businesses), we discussed how the impacts of climate change on business would affect our Profit and Loss Statement, specifically looking at which financial indicators would be impacted and in what ways. We then summarized those impacts by developing calculation logic for each impact. Both internal and external data and information were used to confirm the positive (opportunities) and negative (risks) impacts on operating profit in 2050. For example, the calculations for the 1.5 ℃ scenario showed rising costs due to changes in power prices, but also revealed that there will be increased demand for carbon-neutral datacenters and for datacenters generally due to increased communications traffic as the uptake of smart devices accelerates. Overall, the calculations showed that the negative financial impacts of risks will be outweighed by the positive financial benefits arising from opportunities, ultimately leading to a net positive financial impact on operating profits. Our analysis of Sustainable Manufacturing (sectors studied: petrochemicals, automotive, foods, electronic device-related businesses) and Trusted Society (sectors studied: public sector, transportation, energy-related businesses) focused on the business opportunities arising from climate change, assuming the potential to establish new climate change-related markets and concluding that the net impact on sales in 2050 would be positive. Finally, we held a workshop in which we organized the trends in each industry that had been identified when defining the scenarios and the direction of measures to deal with the business impacts requiring emphasis. In specific terms, during the group work we reviewed the current initiatives and gathered views on the directions that future initiatives should take, taking into account the expectations on Fujitsu in the medium- to long-term. Analysis Results Because we were able to confirm that the study and development directions for our business unit offerings are aligned with the opportunities shown in the scenario analyses, and that countermeasures for the identified risks are also being prepared, our assessment was that Fujitsu’s businesses are strategically resilient from a medium- to long-term perspective. Our current themes and areas are “Carbon Neutrality” and “Resilient Supply Chains” in the Sustainable Manufacturing area, and “Sustainable Energy & Environment” and “Sustainable Transportation” in the Trusted Society area, and we are progressing with the development of our offerings.

To conduct company-wide risk assessments on a regular basis, the committee prepares tools, distributes them to each Risk Management & Compliance Officer and gathers responses. The departments in charge of each risk across the company utilize these tools to conduct assessments on items such as the impact and likelihood of occurrence related to risk threats and the status of countermeasures, and they also provide responses regarding those risk threats. Climate change-related risk assessments are conducted by all relevant departments, using information collected from across the company, based on the expertise of each department in areas such as policy, reputation, natural disasters, the supply chain, and products and services. The Risk Management and Compliance Committee conducts an integrated matrix analysis of the assessments returned by each department with respect to impact severity and likelihood, and then identifies high-priority risks at the company-wide level. The results of this analysis are reported to the Board of Directors. The Sustainable Management Committee shares the business risks, opportunities, and countermeasures resulting from climate change, and manages their progress. The Fujitsu Group has also established environmental management systems based on the ISO 14001 s tandard. Under these systems, we monitor regulatory compliance and other risks.

These activities are ranked as activities that will increase the positive impact on biodiversity in the Group's short- and mid-term targets. ①Blakiston’s Fish Owl Call Recognition Project The Fujitsu Group has provided the Wild Bird Society of Japan with call recognition software, developed for use in habitat surveys of the endangered Blakiston’s fish owl. Implementing measures based on habitat survey results is important for the conservation of the species. Surveys are conducted by analyzing sound data recordings, but the main problem for the Wild Bird Society was that playing and replaying the recorded sounds to identify the Blakiston’s fish owl was enormously time-consuming. By providing the call recognition software, we helped streamline the surveys to enable the automatic extraction of the owl’s cries, thus greatly reducing the time required for analysis. ②Supporting the Harapan Rainforest (Forest of Hope) We continually provide support to a project launched by BirdLife International Tokyo for reforestation activities in the Harapan Rainforest (Forest of Hope) on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Dealing with forest fires and illegal logging is an urgent issue in the Harapan Rainforest.

Structural reforms undertaken since FY 2015 h ave channeled most management resources into the core sector of Technology Solutions. In FY 2019, Fujitsu repositioned itself as a Digital Transformation (DX) enterprise that aims to make full use of digital technologies in the creation of innovative services and business processes. Then in 2021, the company launched Fujitsu Uvance. The objective going forward is to make the world more sustainable by developing businesses with integrated cutting-edge AI technologies that will help customers achieve Sustainability Transformation (SX) and solve societal problems. The nature of the Fujitsu Group’s environmental impact has changed as a result of this modified business model. For example, manufacturing semiconductors, electronic components and PCs accounted for the majority of energy consumption in the past, but business restructuring has greatly reduced the amount of energy these industries consume. Conversely, with the expansion in cloud computing and IoT, electricity consumption in Fujitsu data centers now accounts for a large portion of total power use. The Fujitsu Group is therefore promoting environmental activities linked to its growth strategy, responding to the demands of society by using renewable energy, reducing the power data centers consume, and improving their efficiency. FUJITSU-PUBLIC 5-3-4-1 @Fujitsu 2024 Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 264 ===== Operating as a Responsible Global Corporate Citizen The adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by the United Nations and the commencement of the COP 21 P aris Agreement increased the need for initiatives aimed at building globally sustainable societies. The Fujitsu Group employed a materiality analysis in a Groupwide review designed to enhance the effectiveness of activities that aim to contribute to sustainable development. This analysis identified six priority issues including the environment; human rights, diversity and inclusion; wellbeing; and supply chain. The result is a unified framework under the banner of Global Responsible Business (GRB), which will oversee activities that strengthen initiatives in non-financial areas while striving for ‘sustainability management’ worthy of a responsible global corporate citizen. History of the Environmental Action Plan Environmental Awareness Contributes to Sustainability for Our Customers and Society The Fujitsu Group has formulated an Environmental Action Plan since 1993 and c ontinues to broaden the scope of its environmental activities. Between stages I and V (FY 1993-2009) the objective was to significantly reduce the environmental impact of the Fujitsu Group itself. Far- reaching measures were implemented throughout our factories and offices to cut CO emissions and chemical pollutants, to reduce waste, and so on. In stage VI (FY 2010-2012) , we expanded the focus of our activities to three important initiatives. In addition to strengthening measures to lessen our own impact on the environment, we supported similar efforts by customers and society as a whole and also took on the challenge of conserving biodiversity. Between stages VII and IX (FY 2013-2020), we clearly demonstrated our commitment to contributing to the resolution of environmental issues faced by customers and society through the use of ICT. In order to reduce our own environmental impact, we expanded the scope of our activities to cover the entire supply chain, including suppliers. In stage X (FY 2021-2022) , we worked to promote and expand the use of renewable energy for our customers and society by utilizing leading-edge ICT technologies unique to the Fujitsu Group, such as the introduction of renewable energy at our business sites through CPPA and other means, and blockchain technology. 2 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 5-3-4-2 @Fujitsu 2024 Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 265 ===== The Fujitsu Group will continue responding to the demands of changing times and will deepen and further develop its environmental activities with the goal of helping to create a sustainable and rewarding society.

From FY 2024, we will measure and disclose the quantitative amount of our contribution. Furthermore, to realize a sustainable society in which no one is left behind, we will develop solutions, services and initiatives that contribute to SX, so that customers and societies alike will trust and objectively rate us on a worldwide scale as a leader in SX. Fujitsu and Supply Chain Climate Change In order to achieve Net Zero (*1) e missions of greenhouse gases from our business activities and from the entire value chain, we set reduction targets for FY2025. We will achieve these through the strategic deployment of renewable energy and the use of advanced ICT to drive energy conservation, while at the same time encouraging our suppliers to monitor and reduce their environmental impact, make their own products more energy-efficient, and so on. *1 Net Zero Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 90% or more from the base year in the target year and remove residual emissions of 10% or l ess by directly recovering CO  from the atmosphere (DAC) or by absorbing CO  through planting trees. Resource Circulation We aim to develop these products and services in FY 2025 in order to design products that conserve resources and improve the resource recycling rate, and to build a circular economy business model that can overcome resource constraints. We will also continue to reduce water use and raise awareness of water resource conservation throughout the supply chain. 2 2 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 5-3-4-4 @Fujitsu 2024 Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 267 ===== Living in Harmony with Nature In response to Target 15 o f the Global Targets for 2030 set out by the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, we will achieve nature-positive outcomes by reducing negative impacts on biodiversity and increasing positive impacts in the areas of our corporate operations, including supply chains.

This is particularly true in EU countries where, based on the European Green Deal policy, almost all products distributed are subject to Ecodesign regulations as part of a circular economy action plan (excluding some EU countries). The implementation of the Ecodesign regulations is accompanied by a Digital Product Passport (DPP) that will become mandatory in a few years. As an inescapable feature of continuing to conduct business in Europe, these regulations require a range of responses, including customs clearance. We deliver large numbers of products to consumers via supply chains that span the globe, but to address the various demands outlined above, it is crucial that we provide highly trustworthy levels of traceability to ensure transparency in the transactions between our various stakeholders. Fujitsu Track and Trust provides a traceability platform that leverages consulting and blockchain technology to solve challenges in customer businesses by quickly testing hypotheses to enable further growth. By providing traceability, Track and Trust enables cost reductions and greater efficiency in implementing the processes involved in raw materials procurement, product manufacturing and the downstream logistics. It can also be used to boost corporate and brand value by disclosing the enterprise’s contributions to achieving the SDGs to customers (ESG reports).

The waters of Japan, including its exclusive economic zone (EEZ), ranks sixth in the world and have the potential to realize up to 5,000 tons of CO  reductions using blue carbon. This could be the trump card when it comes to CO reductions, since it surpasses the figure for the amount of CO  absorbed by the world’s forests, which are declining due to the lack of people committed to their preservation. Furthermore, blue carbon has the advantage of being able to be traded in the market as J Blue Credits if it is applied for and verified. However, the creation of blue carbon has been a challenge due to the high cost involved in underwater operations. Fujitsu’s blue carbon measurement and verification technology dramatically reduces this high cost of underwater operations through ICT. Rather than the current method where large numbers of divers visually check the growth of multiple hectares of seaweed and then use mathematical formulas to make estimates, Fujitsu’s technology uses tools such as underwater drones to enable an AI to learn the underwater CO concentrations. Combining this with remote sensing for widespread measurement, enables highly precise calculations at a low cost without using divers. [Fig. 1]  The Fujitsu Laboratories Ocean Digital Twin is a key technology that reproduces the marine environment with high precision in a digital space. It can make predictions by using simulations of the changes in the environments that make up the ocean and the effects of ocean-based global warming countermeasures. This is achieved through the use of technologies such as AI and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) that collect high-resolution 3D data of underwater organisms and structures [Fig. 2]. Through its blue carbon measurement and verification technology, Fujitsu is aiming to establish underwater digital twinning for seaweed beds by FY2026. As well as supporting blue carbon development, this is also working towards Sustainability Transformation (SX)(*2) by supporting proposals for initiatives such as measures by companies and local governments to protect biodiversity on coral reefs and to preserve and develop seaweed beds. Together with an external research organization(*3), we conducted verification testing for these technologies in the coastal waters around Ishigaki Island in Okinawa. We successfully collected highly detailed 3D data for coral reefs and confirmed the viability of the technologies. The results of this testing were very highly rated by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) and we were the first company to take part in seminars(*4) run by the Ministry. 2 2 2 2 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 5-3-4-17 @Fujitsu 2024 Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 280 ===== Our goal is to begin proof-of-concept trials during FY2024, and we are already laying the groundwork for collaborations with other companies.

Fujitsu is one of 12 m embers on the Policy Working Group tasked with reviewing policies in Japan. The top-priority policies recommended by the RE100 members are listed below. 1. Implement policies promoting transparent and fair electricity prices, aiming to improve the cost-effectiveness of renewable electricity generation and pricing. 2. Improve access to Physical and Virtual Corporate Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs)(*5) by establishing streamlined processes and removing barriers for buyers and suppliers. 3. Prioritize grid upgrades and operational improvements to speed up the connection time for new renewables projects and maximize usage of existing renewables to avoid curtailment. In a public statement issued on 25 June 2024, RE100 participants consisting of over 420 of the world’s biggest and most influential companies, including 87 companies headquartered in Japan, strongly urged the Japanese government to set more ambitious targets for renewable energy installation. They demanded that Japan leverage the opportunities created by the transition to net zero to urgently increase its renewable energy generation capacity threefold (to 363 GW) by 2035 in the forthcoming 7th Strategic Energy Plan being formulated by the Japanese government. Through this involvement, Fujitsu is both promoting renewable energy within the company and actively participating in campaigns to promote renewable energy throughout Japan. In doing so, we are contributing to the broader adoption of renewable energy across society and to business through the accompanying energy solutions. Shortly after Fujitsu endorsed the “GX League Basic Concept”, released by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) on February 1, 2022, w e began cooperating in this initiative and have continued as active participants since the GX League(*6) became fully operational in FY2023.

Since then, efforts to achieve a carbon-neutral society have been accelerating on a global scale. The COP26 Glasgow Accords further solidified the 1.5° C target adopted under the Paris Agreement, elevating it to the standard for global climate change measures. The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) was established in December 2015 b y the Financial Stability Board, which members comprise central banks, financial regulatory authorities and finance ministries from major countries. The TCFD requests companies to use multiple climate scenarios to evaluate the climate-related risks and opportunities to their business and to assess and disclose the financial impact. Various international initiatives have also been launched, such as the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which calls for corporate emissions reduction targets set to meet the 1.5 ℃ trajectory, and RE100, which calls for companies to source 100% of the electricity they use from renewable energy.

For example, disasters triggered by climate change can disrupt procurement, logistics and energy supply networks, which in turn interrupts the process of supplying materials and energy to business sites. Furthermore, delays in responding to societal and legislative requirements to reduce GHG emissions may impact product manufacturing, service development, etc., potentially leading to the loss of business opportunities. Since launching the Fujitsu Group Environmental Action Plan, we have treated the reduction of GHG emissions as a critical issue and strived to achieve the defined targets. The majority of the GHG emissions generated by the Fujitsu Group derive from purchased electricity, rather than the combustion of oil or gas. In particular, the energy consumption for cloud computing, IoT, and network communications continues to rise. To curb energy consumption and reduce GHG emissions, the Fujitsu Group conducts regular checks at its factories, data centers, and offices.

In August of the same year, the company obtained SBT validation for 2°C-aligned GHG emissions reduction targets. The SBTi aims to significantly reduce greenhouse gases over the medium to long term by encouraging companies to set voluntary GHG emissions reduction targets based on scientific knowledge compiled by organizations such as the IPCC (*2). Given the accelerating global trend toward carbon neutrality, the Fujitsu Group reviewed its position and revised its target to reduce GHG emissions from business sites in FY2030 from 33% to 71.4% b elow FY2013 l evels. On April 15, 2021, this r evised figure was successfully validated as a 1.5° C-aligned target by SBTi. To accelerate the global community’s journey to carbon neutrality, including within our supply chain, Fujitsu has pledged to expand our use of renewables to achieve net-zero GHG emissions (*3) for our own operations by FY2030, and across our entire value chain (Scope 1, 2, 3) b y FY2040. In June 2023, our net-zero by FY2040 target obtained “Net-Zero Target validation” under the SBTi standard. Working backwards from these GHG emissions reduction targets, we developed the Fujitsu Group Environmental Action Plan (Stage XI) to implement our environmental targets for FY2023-2025. To achieve carbon neutrality, we are aiming for at least 50% of the energy used by our businesses to be from renewable sources by FY2025, with a target of 100% by FY2030. At the same time, we are working towards achieving net-zero GHG emissions across the entire value chain through measures such as identifying the environmental impacts of our suppliers and promoting emissions reductions, and by further reducing energy consumption of Fujitsu products.

As a result, all of our primary suppliers have undertaken efforts to reduce their CO  emissions. Starting in FY2016, w e have also been expanding these efforts further upstream in the supply chain by encouraging our suppliers to include their own suppliers (secondary suppliers from the perspective of the Fujitsu Group) in these activities. In parallel, we have also participated in the CDP Supply Chain program since FY2018. B ased on our international environmental research activities, we are taking a more in-depth look at the activities of our primary suppliers to reduce CO  emissions and conserve water resources, and considering the issues and our policies. Moreover, as a new initiative, we are asking our main suppliers to establish a CO  reduction target based on the international standard of Science Based Targets (SBT). Starting in FY2022, we have also expanded the target suppliers for CO  emissions reduction to include those in the services industry in addition to the existing category of parts manufacturing as we strive to further reduce global warming. The Group hosts seminars on setting reduction targets based on SBT. About 90% of target suppliers attend the seminar. In addition, we also host webinars on how to set targets and share FAQ. We support our suppliers’ CO  reduction efforts through the provision of a simple tool for suppliers to visualize CO  emissions (Scope 1 a nd 2) of their own company and determine the appropriateness of their SBT. 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 5-3-4-37 @Fujitsu 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 300 ===== We expect that having the supply chain as a whole work toward reducing emissions can produce even greater reduction effects (synergies), while also expanding the network of these activities through the supply chain to cover an even wider area spreading beyond national boundaries.

We also conducted our own environmental survey to ascertain the status of activities by these suppliers. We then provided suppliers who responded to the survey with feedback in the form of a report that analyzed survey responses as a reference for their future activities, and we also requested that they further promote these activities and expand them to include their own suppliers. As of the end of FY2023, 22.5% (126 s uppliers) responded that they had requested their own suppliers to engage in emissions reduction activities. Over 49,000 secondary suppliers have been asked to engage in emissions reduction activities, and this should substantially impact awareness. 2 2 2 2 Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 5-3-4-38 @Fujitsu 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 301 ===== Status of primary suppliers’ request that secondary suppliers engage in activities to reduce their CO emissions* * Excludes suppliers who did not respond and suppliers without secondary suppliers.

The actions that organizations are urged to take in order to meet this goal include the efficient use of natural resources, the appropriate management of chemical substances and waste products throughout the entire product life cycle, and significant reductions in the volume of pollutants emitted into the air, water, and soil. The European Commission also announced its Sustainable Products Initiative (SPI), the cornerstone of its new Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP), in March 2020. It launched a series of bills and policy packages central to achieving the objectives of the CEAP, including the Eco-Design for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR). The ESPR product scope not only expanded, but the Regulation also established performance requirements such as recyclability, durability, repairability, and use of recycled materials. With the increase in product sustainability requirements, the ESPR will also introduce a Digital Product Passport (DPP) to trace throughout the product life cycle, and Carbon Footprint to provide environmental impact assessment information. The requirement for more efficient use of resources is expected to increase worldwide. For example, in the U.S., more and more states are passing Right to Repair laws, while in Japan, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) is working on building a Circular Economy Information Distribution Platform. Companies will need to accommodate these requirements going forward.

Additionally, while the resumed session of the Fifth United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA-5.2) held in February 2022 recognized the usefulness of plastics, it also noted that the problem of plastic pollution, in particular marine pollution, is global in scale. It therefore convened an intergovernmental negotiating committee to begin work during the second half of 2022 on developing an international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, including in the marine environment, with the ambition of concluding the instrument by the end of 2024. In view of these developments, companies need to engage in plastic resource circulation throughout the product life cycle.

The push of the ''Circular economy'' is gaining momentum worldwide. In particular, the abovementioned CEAP adopted in Europe in March 2020 has prompted a wave of discussion around resource recycling, including such topics as the reuse of waste as a resource, improvement of product recyclability and the use of recycled materials. Our existing practices already incorporate recycled plastics in ICT products and use paper instead of plastic for packaging. Building on this foundation, we are now taking a step further by promoting measures such as reducing the number of parts in our products and making them smaller, thinner, and lighter. We are also focusing on the reuse of resources from used ICT products and waste generated at our business sites. In the past, reusing resources from used ICT products continues to be one of the targets of our Environmental Action Plan. We have achieved a reuse rate of over 90% for ICT products used in business and are committed to maintaining this high level and are now continuing our efforts as internal target. In light of the urgent need to address the problem of plastic waste, as outlined above, we will continue to implement initiatives that target packaging materials and other plastic waste. Although changes in our business structure have led to a reduction in overall waste generated, we remain dedicated to further reducing waste and strengthening our recycling and resource utilization efforts to further contribute to a more recycling oriented society. In addition to company-wide measures such as resource-conserving products, we will look at circular economy business models tailored to the characteristics of individual products, and place greater emphasis on designing products tailored to these new business models.

For example, the EC has proposed the Circular Electronics Initiative, as well as maintenance for the eco design directive, and is promoting a circular economy through the entire life cycle of products. This is a growing trend all over the world. We believe that from the perspective of recycling resources, it is important for us to make efficient use of the resources in the ICT products that we provide to customers. We have engaged in design that draws on the principles of reduce, reuse, and recycle, and have developed our products with technology that is effective in reducing the amount of resources we use. Given the growing importance of the circular economy worldwide in recent years, we will continue to promote the reduction of environmental impact through resource saving while shifting our focus to the realization of the circular economy.

Such a water shortage is a risk for companies as well, since it may very well affect the survival of their businesses. As such, it is important for us to recycle and reduce the amount of water we use. Since the Fujitsu Group uses particularly large amounts of water in the manufacture of semiconductors and printed circuit boards, we believe it is necessary to reduce our water consumption in these areas especially. In addition to our general water conservation efforts, we have also worked to reuse and recirculate water, through methods such as pure water recycling and the reuse of rainwater. We are continuing our efforts to effectively use water resources in the Environmental Action Plan (Stage Ⅺ). FY2023 Performance Targets under the Fujitsu Group Environmental Action Plan (Stage Ⅺ) FY2023 result Adding policies to reduce water consumption and reducing water usage by at least 57 thousand m  by the end of FY2025.

We implemented these policies at each business site, plant, etc., so that we could make more efficient use of our water resources. As a result, in FY2023 we reduced our water usage by 59 thousand m , which is 104% o f the 57 thousand m  target set in the Fujitsu Group Environmental Action Plan (Stage Ⅺ). Water Usage in FY2023 was 6.09 Million m  (a 1% R eduction Compared to the Previous Fiscal Year) The total amount of water we used in FY 2023 was 6.09 million m  (output level per sales amount: 162 m /100 million yen), a reduction of 1% c ompared to FY 2022. Additionally, 3.29 million m  of that usage was recycled water, which was a decrease of 14.6% in c omparison to FY 2022.

We reviewed the questions we posed on our environmental survey forms so that we would be able to understand the status of our suppliers' activities and their actual circumstances, and identified the challenges we will face in expanding our activities in the future. Status of water risk assessments conducted by suppliers Since many companies are globally connected through their supply chains, water conservation is an issue that no company can afford to ignore. The first step in conserving water resources is to have an accurate understanding of inherent water risks. An environmental survey conducted by Fujitsu in FY2023 found that 28.4% of suppliers had conducted water risk assessments. As the case in FY2022, this indicates that suppliers have an ongoing awareness of water risk as an issue that needs to be addressed. In order to have suppliers think about conservation of water resources as a more familiar issue, we are offering the ''Water Risk Assessment for Companies'' document, which compiles materials on topics such as the importance of risk assessments, and introduces publicly available assessment tools. In the future, we will request that even more suppliers conduct water risk assessments and request that they work to conserve water resources. 2 Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 5-3-4-52 @Fujitsu 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 315 ===== ''Water Risk Assessment for Companies'' can be downloaded from the following sites.

Water resource use accounts for the remaining 8%, but we found that this was mainly attributable to energy use. We established that Emission of CO  and energy use together account for 99% of the negative-impact factors. This means that activities aimed at reducing GHG emissions, such as energy conservation and the introduction of renewables, can also reduce our Ecological Footprint.

In addition to fostering a corporate culture that each employee does not tolerate any wrongdoing, the Group is also implementing activities to promote a high level of compliance among all stakeholders in Fujitsu’s business, including business partners. The results of these activities are reported to the Risk Compliance Committee, which was established based on “Policy on the Internal Control System” (*1) , and raising awareness and ensuring of the Fujitsu Way Code of Conduct in Fujitsu Group are implemented in cooperation with the Board of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members. In each region, raising awareness and ensuring of the Fujitsu Way Code of Conduct are implemented in cooperation with the Region Risk Compliance Committee established as a subcommittee of the Risk Compliance Committee. The operational status of the Global Compliance Program is regularly reported to the Risk Compliance Committee, the Region Risk Compliance Committee, and the Board of Directors. The development and operation of internal rules, education, and monitoring systems to comply with various laws and regulations related with Fujitsu Group’s business are promoted under the practice and supervision of management.

Fujitsu has also refined its Fujitsu Way Code of Conduct, by developing the Global Business Standards (GBS) (*2) in 20 languages to serve as a guide on legally compliant behavior for all Fujitsu Group- affiliated employees worldwide, and applies the GBS uniformly across the Fujitsu Group. (*2) Global Business Standards Our employee evaluation criteria include assessing the level of an employee’s embodiment of “Our Values” under the Fujitsu Way. One of the values is for employees to act with ethics, transparency and integrity. As such, employee personnel assessment and compensation reflect their level of compliance with the Code of Conduct. Fujitsu Way Financial Well-being Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 5-4-3 @Fujitsu 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 353 ===== Global Compliance Program Fujitsu has developed the Fujitsu Global Compliance Programdisseminate the Fujitsu Way Code of Conduct and the GBS, and is working to maintain and improve the Fujitsu Group’s global legal compliance structure. The Global Compliance Program organizes our various compliance- related activities into five pillars in a systematic manner. The Global Compliance Program promotes external understanding of Fujitsu’s compliance structure and its compliance activities, in addition to clarifying what items Fujitsu needs to address on a continual basis. Based on this Global Compliance Program, we implement various policies and initiatives in each region, taking into account factors such as each country/region’s legal systems and government institutions guidelines. When implementing the Global Compliance Program, we establish internal Group rules and assign a compliance officer in each region to be responsible for compliance activities and ensure the structure’s implementation. We also continuously provide employees with various forms of training, with the goal of embedding the Fujitsu Way Code of Conduct and the GBS. In addition, we have established an internal whistleblower system in the event of compliance issues, and employees are required to immediately report compliance violations to the Risk Management & Compliance Division if they are discovered. We periodically verify the effectiveness of the Global Compliance Program through measures such as risk assessment, audit, and reviews by external specialists, and continuously work towards improving the Global Compliance Program. Global Compliance Program Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 5-4-4 @Fujitsu 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 354 ===== 1. Establishing Policies and Procedures Fujitsu Group's minimum requirements for internal rules that must be established by Fujitsu Group companies have been put together as the Fujitsu Group Global Policy. This policy establishes norms, rules, etc., after taking each country’s law, culture, customs and other characteristics into account. We have instituted the Rules for Compliance with the approval of the Risk Management & Compliance Committee, and expanded the Rules for Compliance into Japanese Group companies with the aim of thoroughly ensuring compliance and sustainably improving corporate value. In particular, under the above rule, we have established more specific, detailed rules and guidelines in the areas with significant impact on business; namely, antitrust law, anti- bribery, and antisocial forces. For non-Japanese Group companies, in addition to the Fujitsu Group Global Policy, we have formulated global guidelines based on the approval of the Risk Management & Compliance Committee, and have had these guidelines adopted into the internal rules of each non- Japanese Group company. In addition to issuing General Compliance Guidelines which correspond to the above Rules for Compliance, we have also issued global guidelines which relate to competition laws and various guidelines which pertain to bribery prevention. With regard to bribery and conflict of interest, in addition to principles defined in the GBS, we have established various internal rules that state the advance application and approval processes required for actions such as providing gifts and hospitality to government officials , receiving gifts and entertainment from business partners by our employees, giving donations, sponsorships and charitable contributions to various organizations, including political organizations, and facilitating payments. We also conduct compliance checks of organizations that receive donations and sponsorships. Furthermore, as one measure for conducting advance surveys and evaluation of transaction risk in regions and fields that are at a high risk for corruption, we perform due diligence at the time of starting new transactions. We screen our suppliers through steps such as requiring suppliers to complete questionnaires according to their risk level. We also require partners to abide by laws and regulations through contracts and other means.

Top-Level Commitment and Securing of Resources Top management expresses its intentions to strive for compliance proactively and continuously through measures such as sending messages to employees. In doing so, Fujitsu puts the Code of Conduct and the GBS into practice and spread them throughout the entire Fujitsu Group. The President himself has repeatedly sent out messages to all employees, both in Japan and overseas, declaring that Fujitsu will put an end to compliance violations such as collusion and the formation of cartels. Even overseas, regional heads and Group company top managers continuously send out messages emphasizing the importance of compliance and a corporate culture that has zero tolerance for wrongdoing. Furthermore, Fujitsu established the annual Fujitsu Compliance Week which begins on December 9th runs until December 15th, t o coincide with ''International Anti-Corruption Day'' (December 9th). During that week, compliance messages are simultaneously sent to employees by top management (including the CEO) at Fujitsu headquarters and the Heads of each business region, and Presidents of group companies in each country. We also release annually updated Compliance e-Learning to employees of all Group companies, and provide compliance-related activities planned for each region. Additionally, we have assigned staff in charge of compliance operations in each region, and have formed a global network composed of staff in charge of risk compliance at each Fujitsu Group company. Based on these steps, we have established a system for operation of our Global Compliance Program. In FY2023, officers responsible for compliance in each region visited Japan for a discussion on a future global compliance policy. Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 5-4-6 @Fujitsu 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 356 ===== 3. Training and Communication The Fujitsu Group continuously conducts various training and communication opportunities for executives and employees in order to embed and implement the Fujitsu Way Code of Conduct, the Global Business Standards, and other internal rules. We provide Compliance e-Learning for all Fujitsu Group executives and employees every year. The contents of this e-learning includes risk areas such as bribery, collusion, fraudulent accounting, and security export control. Moreover, in order to reflect the results of risk assessment and social conditions, the Compliance Division at Fujitsu headquarters and compliance staff from each region conduct an annual review of the e-learning. In FY2023, compliance e-learning was conducted in 14 la nguages for all Fujitsu Group executives and employees (approximately 120,000 people). As of April 2024, 97% o f all executives and employees have already taken the course. In addition to the measures listed above, we conduct timely online training and e-learning in accordance with the risk level of each organizational level, region, and division. The training and e-learning is based on laws, customs, and actual business conditions in each country. Every year, Fujitsu and domestic Group companies hold compliance training sessions targeted at newly appointed executives. This training is conducted by lawyers from outside Fujitsu, and the company's legal and compliance divisions. For managers, we periodically conduct internal training where in-house instructors explain the importance of the Code of Conduct and compliance, in addition to discussing typical scenarios and difficult situations. We have also implemented compliance education as part of training for new employees. In addition to ensuring that new employees understand the importance of the Fujitsu Way Code of Conduct and the Global Business Standards, we continually provide education that focuses on specific risks in organizations such as sales divisions and legal division. In FY2023, we conducted compliance training for approximately 211 p artner companies. As mentioned above, Fujitsu has designated an annual Fujitsu Compliance Week, during which the CEO and regional heads send out a message to employees and distribute compliance- related news. In addition to these top-down activities, we collect ideas and strategies from employees on how to avoid compliance violations through surveys. The valuable insights gathered from these surveys are then published on the company intranet, providing an opportunity for employees to learn from each other.

Reporting and Responding to Incidents Establishing an Internal Whistleblower System The Fujitsu Group has established an internally and externally accessible portal, operated as Fujitsu Alert, to receive internal whistleblower reports and consultation (including anonymous reports) from all Group employees (including board members, retirees, temporary transfers, contracted employees, part-time employees, dispatch workers, and others) and offer consultations. Group companies also maintain and operate separate internal whistleblower systems. Through a web form or telephone hotline, Fujitsu Alert accepts reports on suspected wrongdoing or concern from all Fujitsu Group employees and external parties relevant to the Fujitsu Group, including customers and suppliers (anonymously, if applicable). Fujitsu Alert is available in 14 la nguages 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Fujitsu Alert also serves as reporting system for business partners from which the Fujitsu Group (companies in which Fujitsu has direct or indirect investment of more than 50%) directly procures goods, software or services. Fujitsu Alert is publicized to employees via periodic messages, compliance training sessions, websites, and posters. In addition, Fujitsu periodically confirms trends in the usage of Fujitsu Alert in order to ensure increased recognition for and confidence in the systems among employees. Protection of Whistleblower Employees are encouraged to report breaches or potential breaches of compliance of which they become aware. Furthermore, if employees are unsure of the appropriate action to be taken, they can seek advice from a supervisor in their division or a specialized division such as the legal division. Anonymous reports can be submitted to Fujitsu Alert, and we handle information with the utmost care in order to preserve anonymity. Even in cases where the whistleblower is indirectly identified during investigation process, we strictly prohibit the adverse treatment of whistleblowers due to their reports, and any such adverse treatment will be regarded as an extremely serious breach of internal policies. Fujitsu Alert Compliance Line for Suppliers in Japan Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 5-4-8 @Fujitsu 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 358 ===== Response to Reports When a breach of compliance is reported on Fujitsu Alert, we will conduct an internal investigation under the supervision of responsible managers who are licensed attorneys, and will cooperate with external attorneys when necessary. Fujitsu directly reports the results of its internal investigations to the Board of Directors and the Risk Management & Compliance Committee. These reports are made independent of the division and/or affiliated companies which are involved in the subject matter under investigation. Depending on the content of the report, the Compliance Division may delegate an investigation to other authorized divisions if deemed appropriate. The Compliance Division will conduct an appropriate internal investigation in order to understand the facts and review possible countermeasures in accordance with applicable laws and professional standards. The internal investigation includes, but is not limited to, consideration of applicable laws, consideration of appropriate investigation steps, evaluation of collected evidence, documentation of investigation results, and reporting or escalation. Depending on the results of the investigation, Fujitsu provides feedback to the whistleblower if necessary based on applicable laws such as the data protection laws and business laws. In the event that the investigation has verified problems according to the Code of Conduct, Global Business Standards, or other internal rules, we take corrective measures such as disciplinary action and reflect the results in personnel evaluations. In order to prevent similar problems from occurring in the future, we remind all parties of rules, revise systems, strengthen monitoring and supervision, and take other necessary measures. The process for these investigations, etc., is also reviewed and improved at least once a year, including at the time of establishment of the annual plan under the Global Compliance Program and/or at the time of enactment or amendment of relevant laws. Fujitsu may be either required by law or decide based on business judgement to provide information about compliance violations to certain government and/or judicial agencies (including, but not limited to, government investigative agencies or courts). When making such decisions, Compliance Division staff work together with managers and other relevant divisions as necessary. Moreover, letters or emails received via platforms other than Fujitsu Alert are also reviewed for investigation of suspected compliance breach and corrective measures and response are taken as needed.

In addition, we periodically report to the Risk Management & Compliance Committee, the Board of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members concerning internal whistleblower reports and consultations, as well as our responses to major compliance issues. Please refer to the Fujitsu Group Integrated Report for the number of meetings of the Risk Management & Compliance Committee and the Board of Directors. 5. Monitoring and Reassessment The Fujitsu Group conducts annual verification of the effectiveness of the Global Compliance Program through reviews of our risk assessment and internal auditing activities, and through reviews by external experts such as law firms. We are also working to continuously improve our Global Compliance Program based on the results of applicable reviews and audits, as well relevant social conditions. Please refer to the Risk Management page regarding our risk assessment activities. The Compliance Division of Fujitsu headquarters continually assesses risk that mainly targets Group companies located in overseas countries and regions with a high risk of corruption. Through interviews with executives/employees and verification of internal rules and business processes, the Compliance Division analyzes the compliance risks of local businesses. It then proposes countermeasures in accordance with the actual contents and extent of risks, and supports the implementation of those countermeasures. The status of risk assessment and implementation of the Global Compliance Program are periodically reported to the Risk Management & Compliance Committee, the Regional Risk Management & Compliance Committees, and the Board of Directors. The discussions and decisions made at these meetings are reflected and implemented in a timely manner to activities in the Global Compliance Program. Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 5-4-12 @Fujitsu 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 362 ===== Initiatives for Security Export Controls From the viewpoint of maintaining global peace and security, the export of goods and the transfer of technology that could be used for the development or production of weapons of mass destruction or conventional weaponry are controlled by an international framework for security export controls. In Japan, by following its framework, the regulations for security export controls are implemented under the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act (the Foreign Exchange Act). In line with one of the Fujitsu Way Code of Conduct, “We comply with all laws and regulations,” Fujitsu has enacted “Security Export Control Regulations” internally and thoroughly enforced it as the fundamental policy to promote security export controls in accordance not only with the Foreign Exchange Act, but with the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) of the United States, which is applied extraterritorially. As Fujitsu's management system, the President serves as the Security Export Control Chief Officer, while the Security Export Control Office in the Corporate Governance and Compliance Unit serves as the organizer of the security export control operations. On the operational process, it is required that, before export of goods and the transfer of technology to overseas, all classification and transaction screening (scrutinizing destination country/region, end- use/end-user) are surely executed and then all necessary licenses are adequately obtained. “Security Export Control Regulations” also sets the rule that legal violations shall be reported immediately. When execution of business, to prevent legal violations by misinterpretation and/or overlook of related regulations, Fujitsu closely aligns with the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry which has jurisdiction over export administration regulations. Due to such internal system for security export controls upheld, the regular audit is conducted, as well as the export controls training is provided to all executives and employees. For domestic and overseas Group companies, the guidance about rules and frameworks for proper security export controls is offered accordingly, and any related activities like educational support, audit support and event with the Group for information exchange are given as well. Furthermore, since FY 2013, e-L earning course about basic security export controls has been developed, which is available in multiple languages for Fujitsu Group companies worldwide.

The Company has, apart from the organization that prepares financial reports, an organization under the Chief Financial Officer responsible for establishing, operating, and evaluating internal control over Fujitsu Group financial reporting, to ensure the effectiveness and reliability of financial reports. These organizations create rules for establishing, operating, and evaluating internal control over the unified accounting policies shared throughout the Fujitsu Group and financial reporting. The organization responsible for establishing, operating, and evaluating internal control over financial reporting periodically reports to the Board of Directors and any other relevant person or organization the results of evaluations on the effectiveness of the internal control.

We understand the purpose and essence of each country’s tax laws and treaties, as well as other guidelines such as those laid out in the Business Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project led by the OECD, and abide by them. We strive to file tax returns and pay taxes appropriately. In transactions between related companies, we will comply with the general rule of an arm’s length price and distribute profits appropriately. Tax Governance The Director who serves as the Chief Financial Officer is responsible for the proper filing and fulfilment of tax returns and obligations, management of tax risks, and optimization of tax expenses. Important matters and risks related to tax are reported to the management meeting and Board of Directors in a timely and appropriate manner for approval. Transfer Pricing We comply with the principle of arm's length pricing and distribute profits appropriately when conducting transactions between affiliated companies. We do not transfer business profits generated in countries/regions to countries/regions with low tax rates where we do not conduct business transactions.

In 2005, we developed the ''CSR Procurement Guidelines” for sustainable procurement and  requested our suppliers in Japan and overseas to comply appropriately. In 2018, w e adopted the  RBA (*1) Code of Conduct as our ''Fujitsu Group CSR Procurement Guidelines.'' We revised the　 guidelines in 2023, changed the name to “Fujitsu Group Sustainable Procurement Policy”, and  are now in the process of requiring our main suppliers to provide their written agreement to the  Policy. (*1) [PRESS RELEASE] Fujitsu Joins EICC, a Global Corporate Social Responsibility Coalition (which was rebranded to become the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) in October 2017) Sustainable Procurement Activities & Periodic Reviews Under the group-wide policy, the relevant divisions in the Fujitsu Group collaborate regarding sustainability activities. In the area of procurement, the Global Supply Chain Unit works with the relevant divisions in promoting sustainable activities by suppliers. The sustainability activities are targeted at our major suppliers, that is, the largest suppliers by procurement value and those who have ongoing dealings with Fujitsu. Fujitsu Group Procurement Policy RBA Code of Conduct  Fujitsu Group Sustainable Procurement Policy FUJITSU-PUBLIC @Fujitsu 2024 Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 5-5-2 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 374 ===== We initially use the Sustainable Procurement Policy to clarify the compliance items and then require our suppliers to undertake sustainability activities. To confirm that these activities are being fully implemented by suppliers, we ask them to respond to a CSR survey, plus various other surveys on topics such as green procurement, information security and Business Continuity Management (BCM). The survey responses are analyzed and the results are returned to the suppliers as feedback. Where a supplier fails to meet Fujitsu’s standards, we require them to undertake improvements. Where there is a particular need to check whether sustainability activities are being fully implemented by a supplier, a CSR audit is conducted. Such suppliers are required to submit a remediation plan for any matters identified by the audit and Fujitsu works with the suppliers to make the necessary improvements. Fujitsu is continually enhancing its processes and promoting sustainable procurement with the goal that ultimately sustainability activities will be properly undertaken by suppliers and will become firmly entrenched. Imprimenting Activities and Participation in Industry-standard Initiatives (RBA Membership) The Fujitsu Group is a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), a global CSR alliance. As such, we abide by the RBA’s Code of Conduct and engage in sustainable procurement with our suppliers and throughout our supply chain. The RBA receives regular input from stakeholders to inform the ongoing development and implementation of the Code of Conduct. Many companies in the Fujitsu Group supply chain are currently members of the RBA. We have incorporated the RBA Code of Conduct, which reflects the opinions of workers at those companies, into the Fujitsu Group Sustainable Procurement Policy. As such, we expect the suppliers with whom we do materials, parts, and hardware products business, to comply with the Policy. The Fujitsu Group also takes an active role in the programs and initiatives of organizations such as the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA) and works to implement sustainable procurement in the industry. FUJITSU-PUBLIC @Fujitsu 2024 Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 5-5-3 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 375 ===== Structure for Responsible Minerals Procurement Addressing High-Risk Minerals The policy of the Fujitsu Group is to exclude from its products, components and supply chain any minerals that give rise to conflicts (“conflict minerals”), or minerals that are at high risk of being associated with forced labuor or human rights violations. (The Fujitsu Group identifies tantalum, tin, gold, tungsten and cobalt as high-risk minerals.) Fujitsu has also established a structure to ensure the transparency of procurement activities in the supply chain and the responsible procurement of minerals. This structure includes the relevant internal divisions and operates under the jurisdiction of the Sustainability Management Committee (chaired by Fujitsu’s CEO). Surveys on High-Risk Minerals As part of its due diligence, the Fujitsu Group conducts high-risk minerals surveys with reference to the “OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas”. These surveys use the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT) and Extended Minerals Reporting Template (EMRT) developed by the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). Reminders are sent to those suppliers who failed to respond to our survey by the due date. If survey responses reveal insufficient answers, suppliers are asked to resubmit their responses. Where customers indicate that a smelter is considered to be “risky”, we ask suppliers using that smelter to re-examine the nature of their dealings with the smelter. While there have been no confirmed reports yet of smelters having any involvement with armed groups, we will continue to conduct programs aimed at identifying smelters and further increasing transparency in our supply chain. Fujitsu Group Policy on Responsible Minerals Procurement List of smelters checked in the surveys FUJITSU-PUBLIC @Fujitsu 2024 Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 5-5-4 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 376 ===== Promoting Green Procurement The Fujitsu Group has set out its basic approach to the environmentally sound procurement of components, materials and products in the Fujitsu Group Green Procurement Direction, and we are working with our suppliers to promote green procurement activities. One target for such activities is the reduction of CO  emissions, and the Fujitsu Group is requesting that its suppliers, and their suppliers in turn, set targets and promote activities to reduce their CO emissions. In addition, we are asking our suppliers to conduct water risk assessments as a first step toward water resource conservation. We will continue to promote activities that reduce environmental impacts throughout our supply chain. Promoting the Setting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Targets in the Supply Chain With the intention of accelerating the journey to carbon neutrality, the Fujitsu Group has set FY2030 as its new goal to reduce its carbon emissions to zero, 20 years ahead of the previous schedule. The Fujitsu Group has achieved SBTi net zero certification as a result. Moreover, the Group is working to achieve net zero emissions across the entire value chain (Scope 3), including the supply chain, by FY2040. To work together with our suppliers on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the supply chain, we hold briefings for our major suppliers, encouraging them to set reduction targets in line with international standards and implement reduction activities. Promoting Diversity in the Supply Chain The Fujitsu Group is committed to ensuring diversity throughout the supply chain. We believe that an environment in which diverse human resources are afforded equal opportunities and can leverage each other’s values and abilities is essential to fostering innovation and, ultimately, to building and developing a robust, sustainable supply chain. 2 2 Fujitsu Group Green Procurement FUJITSU-PUBLIC @Fujitsu 2024 Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 5-5-5 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 377 ===== Given that societal issues and challenges differ depending on the country and location, our supplier diversity initiatives are based on policies developed and implemented according to the characteristics of each country/location. In Japan, for example, since women's empowerment figures prominently on the social agenda, we are promoting activities under the theme of supporting women's empowerment in the supply chain. Specifically, as a first step toward visualizing the status of our initiatives and to foster awareness, we are asking our major suppliers to register information on the status of women's empowerment at their companies in the “Database of Companies Promoting Women’s Participation and Advancement in the Workplace” established by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. Promoting Information Security Measures Based on the “Cybersecurity Management Guidelines” issued in December 2015 b y Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and the Information-technology Promotion Agency (IPA), the Fujitsu Group, along with its suppliers, has adopted the goal of “eliminating information security incidents”, and is continually implementing measures to prevent such incidents or recurrences. These measures include education, raising awareness, auditing and sharing information. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the commercial use of external services such as cloud computing and social media. There has also been a rapid increase in opportunities for the use of smart devices such as smartphones and tablet PCs. Regarding the risk of information leaks, it is necessary to prevent not only incorrectly addressed emails being sent by mistake and the theft or loss of PCs and smart devices, but also new kinds of risks such as in-house crimes and cyber terrorism. In this context, when the Fujitsu Group consigns work to suppliers, including those outside Japan, it promotes education and awareness by requiring the same standards of information security management and handling of personal information as it applies to its own operations. If any serious problem regarding information security is discovered at a supplier, or if the supplier fails to immediately implement corrective measures and no improvement is observed, Fujitsu will take steps such as reviewing its business relationship with the supplier. FUJITSU-PUBLIC @Fujitsu 2024 Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 5-5-6 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 378 ===== Enhancing Supply Chain BCM The Fujitsu Group sees the enhancement of Business Continuity Management (BCM) throughout its supply chain as essential to ensuring a stable supply of products and services in the event of major disasters or other unexpected contingencies. Accordingly, since FY2007 we have provided our suppliers with ongoing support to improve their BCM capabilities. Fujitsu conducts an annual questionnaire-based survey of its suppliers on how they address BCM. This survey also covers some group companies that conduct their own procurement. We analyze the responses to the survey and then provide feedback to the suppliers and group companies. Since FY2014, w e have been using a standard survey form developed by JEITA’s Materials Committee. Fujitsu also conducts annual surveys of major solutions-related suppliers, analyzing the responses and providing feedback. Communication with Suppliers Feedback of Assessment Results in the Suppliers' Performance Review (SPR) System Under the SPR (*2) System, the Fujitsu Group targets primarily its major suppliers and provides direct feedback on the assessment results. Suppliers whose efforts do not meet Fujitsu’s standards are asked to make improvements. Fujitsu also carries out assessments of solutions- related suppliers and provides the results of those assessments as feedback to the major suppliers. （*2） Suppliers’ Performance Review: A program developed by Fujitsu that assesses the performance of procured goods and the basic profile of enterprises in terms of quality, technology, price, supply and CSR.

In addition to sustainable procurement and green procurement, training aimed at increasing awareness among procurement staff is also offered in the areas of risk management (BCM activities) and compliance with legislation such as the Act Against Delay in Payment of Subcontract Proceeds, etc. to Subcontractors and the Act on Securing the Proper Operation of Worker Dispatching Businesses and Protecting Dispatched Workers. Complying with the Act Against Delay in Payment of Subcontract Proceeds, etc. to Subcontractors The entire Fujitsu Group makes every effort to maintain legal compliance in accordance with the Fujitsu Way Code of Conduct and Global Business Standards (GBS). We also educate the entire Fujitsu Group and our suppliers on the Act Against Delay in Payment of Subcontract Proceeds, etc. to Subcontractors. In FY2023, we did not violate the Act Against Delay in Payment of Subcontract Proceeds, etc. to Subcontractors. Announcement of ''Declaration of Partnership Building'' Fujitsu has developed and announced its “Declaration of Partnership Building” in order to build new partnerships by promoting cooperation and coexistence with suppliers and value-creating businesses. The Declaration of Partnership Building is an initiative introduced by the “Council for Promoting Partnership Building for the Future”, whose members include the Chairman of Japan Business Federation, the President of Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the President of the Japanese Trade Union Confederation, and relevant ministers (Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry, Minister of State for Special Missions (Minister of State for Economic and Fiscal Policy), Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare, Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, and Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism).

Supplier Compliance Line The Fujitsu Group uses the Supplier Compliance Line as a channel to receive reports from suppliers regarding any actions that are potential or actual instances of non-compliance in our purchasing activities. Channels have been set up both internally and externally through which we can verify and investigate the facts of each report and respond quickly. Fujitsu’s internal reporting standards prohibit any adverse treatment of its own staff making such reports or of staff from suppliers making the reports. Our agreements with suppliers also include explicit provisions on the elimination of anti-social forces and other such groups with the aim of preventing harmful actions by such anti-social forces (and avoiding any encouragement of their activities). The Fujitsu Group, including its suppliers, will have no relationship whatsoever with anti-social forces.

We updated the policy in September 2023 and, adopting the stance that the aim of corporate  governance is to ensure better management, we constantly review the policy to ensure that it does  not become rigid or lose its relevance. We also discuss it with the Board of Directors as appropriate,  and strive to maintain the best corporate governance system at all times.  Corporate Governance Policy Corporate Governance Structure (as of June 24, 2024)  In accordance with its Corporate Governance Policy, the company outlines the following rules to  ensure effective oversight and advice, given from the diverse perspectives of Non-Executive Directors  (hereinafter, the term used for a combination of Independent Directors and Non- Executive Directors  appointed from within the company), to Executive Directors on their business execution as part of the  Board of Directors function while taking advantage of the company through the Audit & Supervisory  Board system.  ＜Board of Directors＞  The Company has a Board of Directors to serve as a body for making important decisions and  overseeing management. The Board of Directors delegates the decision-making authority over  business execution to the Representative Directors and subordinate Corporate Executive Officers to  the broadest extent that is permitted by law and the Articles of Incorporation of the company and is  considered to be reasonable and will mainly perform as oversight and advisory function. Moreover,  the Board of Directors has been formed with Non-Executive Directors at its core so as to enable  correction and remediation of errors, insufficiencies, and recklessness in business execution.And by  ensuring that External Directors, who are highly independent and hold diverse perspectives,  constitute the majority of the members of the Board of Directors, the oversight and advisory function  of the Board of Directors is strengthened. Furthermore, in order to better define the management  responsibility of the Directors, their terms were reduced from two years to one year in accordance  with a resolution at the June 23, 2006 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. As of June 24, 2024, the Board of  Directors consists of nine members in total, comprising three Executive Directors and six Non- Executive Directors (including five External Directors).  In FY2023, the Company held 18 Board of Directors meetings (including six extraordinary meetings) to  Corporate Governance  Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 6-1-1 @Fujitsu 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 399 ===== flexibly resolve and report on the matters that come under the Board’s province pursuant to the  Companies Act and the Regulations of the Board of Directors of the Company. The Board identified  the following six themes as the themes that it should focus on based on the business environment  surrounding Fujitsu Group: 1) new medium term management plan; 2) business portfolio  transformation; 3) profitability improvement in international business; 4) quality and security issues; 5)  succession planning of Directors and others; and 6) efficient monitoring methods of these themes.  The Board had intensive discussions on these themes and continued monitoring them.  Furthermore, as its agenda items, the Board discussed and heard reports on shareholder returns,  examinations of strategic shareholdings, the organization and operation status of internal control  systems, and feedback on dialogues with shareholders and investors. For the evaluation of the  effectiveness of the overall Board, the Board’s Secretariat introduced individual interviews based on  questionnaire responses from FY2023 and analyzed and evaluated the interviews. This allowed the  Board to discuss accurate improvement measures based on the correct understanding of responses  and led to efforts to improve information sharing with outside officers and to further raise the  effectiveness of the Board. The Risk Management & Compliance Committee that oversees risk  management of the entire Group began holding a monthly meeting from FY2023 to ensure the  speediness and effectiveness of each measure. The Board of Directors received a report on the  implementation status of the Committee’s tasks at ever y Board meeting and discussed and  monitored actions taken, including preventative actions of individual quality and security issues.  ＜Audit & Supervisory Board＞  The Company has an Audit & Supervisory Board that performs the auditing and oversight functions.  The auditing and oversight functions are carried out by Audit & Supervisory Board Members, who  review the Board of Directors as well as business execution functions and attend important meetings,  including meetings of the Board of Directors. As of June 24, 2024, the Audit & Supervisory Board has  five members, comprising two full-time Audit & Supervisory Board Members and three External Audit  & Supervisory Board Members.  In FY2023, the Company held 11 Audit & Supervisory Board meetings (including two extraordinary  meetings), mainly to develop and resolve its audit policy and audit plans, confirm the audit plan and  method of Accounting Auditors, and examine the appropriateness of their audit results and key audit  matters. In addition, the Audit & Supervisory Board heard reports from the internal audit section and  heard and discussed the reports on important items made by full time Audit & Supervisory Board  Members to Externa l Audit & Supervisory Board Members. Except for one meeting where one  member was absent, all Audit & Supervisory Board Members attended all Audit & Supervisory Board  meetings.  In FY2023, Audit & Supervisory Board Members conducted the following activities with a focus on the  building and operation of internal control systems and responses to management challenges in  accordance with the approved audit policy and plans:  Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 6-1-2 @Fujitsu 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 400 ===== Attending and expressing opinions at the Board of Directors meetings, meetings of Independent Officers, and other important meetings Reading important approval documents Exchanging opinions with Representative Directors Interviewing each business line at the Head Office and subsidiaries on their operations Hearing reports from statutory auditors of subsidiaries Hearing reports from Accounting Auditors Hearing the audit status and results from the internal audit section Hearing the status of whistleblowing from the compliance section Hearing the status of risk management and quality control The discussion topics were potential risks of material misstatements in the consolidated financial  statements and impacts of, and developments in, material events, etc. that occurred in FY2023  ＜Independent Directors & Auditors Council＞  In response to the requirements of Japan’s Corporate Governance Code, which facilitates the activities  of Independent Directors and Auditors, and in order to invigorate discussions on the medium- to long- term direction of the Company at its Board of Directors Meetings, the Company believes it essential  to establish a system that enables Independent Directors and Auditors, who maintain a certain degree  of separation from the execution of business activities, to consistently gain a deeper understanding of  the Company’s business. Based on this recognition, the Company established the Independent  Directors and Auditors Council, which consists of all Independent Directors and Auditors (five  Independent Directors and three Independent Auditors), and discusses the medium- to long-term  direction of the Company, shares information, and exchanges viewpoints so that each can formulate  their own opinions.  In FY2023, the Company held 8 Independent Directors and Auditors Council meetings. The members  continuously discussed the Company’s management direction and on important management  matters that were associated with business restructuring including mergers and acquisitions by the  Company and the Fujitsu Group, and shared information and exchanged viewpoints.  ＜Executive Nomination Committee & Compensation Committee＞   The Company has established the Executive Nomination Committee and the Compensation  Committee as advisory bodies for its Board of Directors for the process of nominating Directors and  Audit & Supervisory Board Members, for ensuring the transparency and objectivity of its process for  determining executive compensation, to enable efficient and substantial discussions, as well as to  ensure the fairness in the structure and level of executive compensation.    The Executive Nomination Committee deliberates on the candidates for Director and Audit &  Supervisory Board Member positions in accordance with the Framework of Corporate Governance  Structure and the Procedures and Policy for the nomination and dismissal of Directors and Auditors  stipulated in the Policy, and it provides its recommendations or proposal to the Board of Directors.

Uncertainties that might affect the achievement of these objectives are considered to be risks. To address these risks, the Fujitsu Group established a Risk Management & Compliance Committee based on the Policy on the Internal Control System determined by the Board of Directors. The Committee reports directly to the Board of Directors and oversees risk management and compliance for the entire Fujitsu Group. The Risk Management & Compliance Committee is chaired by the CEO and is composed of Board Members. Its primary function is to continually assess and verify risks that could potentially lead to losses for the Fujitsu Group. The Committee proactively implements measures to control risks identified during the course of business operations (potential risk management). Additionally, the Committee regularly analyzes realized risks to minimize losses, reporting them to the Board of Directors and working to prevent their recurrence (materialized risk management). The Risk Management & Compliance Committee has established Regional Risk Management & Compliance Committees in each region that forms part of the global, region-based business execution structure. These regional committees operate as subcommittees. The Risk Management & Compliance Committee has deployed Risk Management & Compliance Officers to Business units (First line), as well as to Group companies and regions, both in Japan and overseas. Together, these entities collaborate to build a structure that promotes risk management and compliance throughout the Group. To further strengthen the Group’s risk management capabilities, the company has established the Corporate Risk Management Office (Second line), a department which reports directly to the CEO and is independent of the business divisions. The Committee’s secretariat function is provided by the Corporate Risk Management Office and is supervised by the Chief Risk Management Officer (CRMO).

The CQO convenes a monthly meeting of the Risk Management & Compliance Committee to ensure the swift and effective implementation of corporate policies. To check that the risk management and compliance system is functioning properly, the company conducts annual audits by corporate auditors, internal audits by audit departments (Third line), and external audits by an auditing firm.

Risk scenarios are defined for each important risk, and they are classified into pure risk and management risk. Appointment of risk management departments (Second line) A risk management department is assigned to each important risk, and is responsible for maintaining control over that specific risk. Evaluation of risks to the Fujitsu Group Risk management departments, Business units, and Group companies evaluate the impact of each important risk, the likelihood of its occurrence, and the status of mitigation measures. We select the risks that must be actively taken to achieve the Group's business strategies and goals, and those that must be actively avoided. Ranking and mapping of important risks Based on the evaluation results of the Group, we rank important risks and create risk maps to visualize their importance. High priority risks are determined based on their importance. Risk Management & Compliance Committee Report Analyses are conducted based on the evaluation findings, and mitigation policies are discussed and determined to address important risks to the Group. Issuing of corrective instructions to Business units and Group companies Based on the evaluation results, feedback is provided to Business units and Group companies, advising them on improvements. Risk monitoring within Business units divisions and Group companies Regular risk monitoring is implemented within Business units and Group companies to assess the status of mitigation measures and reduce risk exposure.

Group-Wide Disaster Management The basic policy of Fujitsu and its group companies in Japan is to ensure the safety of staff and facilities when disasters occur, to minimize harm and to prevent secondary disasters. We also aim to ensure that business operations resume quickly, and that we can assist in disaster recovery for our customers and suppliers. To this end, we are building robust collaborative structures in our internal organizations and strengthening our business continuity capabilities. In addition to supporting our customers through the management structure in each business unit and group company, the Fujitsu Group is building ‘area-based disaster management systems’ in each region for working in cooperation with and responding to customers.

Management Structure <Top Management-led Information Security Control> With the rapid increase in more complex and sophisticated cyber attacks, strengthening information security has become a top priority for national economic security and corporate business activities. In order to further strengthen and ensure the effectiveness of information security policies, we believe it is necessary more than ever before to take prompt and appropriate actions under the leadership of top management. Therefore, we have enhanced the structure and functions of the Risk Management and Compliance Committee, chaired by the CEOof the Fujitsu Group, where critical risks and compliance issues in Fujitsu Group are discussed, to enable a continuous, company-wide cyber security controls. In parallel with the security controls by the Risk Management and Compliance Committee, monthly Regular Meetings on Quality and Security Measures have been established as a venue for discussing countermeasures involving the CEO, CISO, CRMO (Chief Risk Management Officer), CQO (Chief Quality Officer), and the heads of each business group to share the status of information security and strengthen measures according to the given status, thereby ensuring CEO-led risk management. Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 6-3-1 @Fujitsu 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 418 ===== <Enhanced CISO Governance Structure> CISO governance structure includes regional CISOs in Japan and three international regions (Americas, Europe, and Asia Pacific) to strengthen information security through a globally integrated structure by aligning headquarters policies with the security requirements specific to each country. For Fujitsu headquarters and group companies in Japan and international regions, information security managers have been assigned to strengthen autonomous information security in each department, and a system has been established to reinforce the leadership by the CISO. Specifically, our security manager system ensures that each department has an “Information Manager,” who oversees the management and protection of information; an “System Security Manager,” who supervises the maintenance and management of information security system; and a “Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT*1 ) Manager,” who leads product vulnerability management., so that they can promote various information security measures in cooperation with the CISO. *1 Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT): An organization that is responsible for incident resolution involving products offered by the company Information Security Management System Run by CISO and Information Security Managers Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 6-3-2 @Fujitsu 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 419 ===== Information Security Initiatives Our Goals for Information Security Our goal is to achieve information security to provide secure services to our customers through appropriate risk control by planning/executing proactive security strategies and initiatives based on security lifecycle management. In order to achieve this goal, we are committed to “respond to cyber attacks with ever-evolving advanced information security” and to “improve the awareness of each employee and reform our organizational culture,” which are the keys to success. The entire Fujitsu Group is united in the efforts to develop processes, rules, and methods to promote cybersecurity practices, and to strengthen information security for the entire Fujitsu Group and while ensuring a safe environment for our customers and partner companies. Company-wide Security Risk Management Scheme To achieve our information security goals, we have established a “Company-Wide Security Risk Management Scheme” which focuses on highly objective security risk identification, visualization, and their precise remediation. The Company-Wide Security Risk Management Scheme forms a dual-loop structure as shown in the figure below. Under the scheme, a combination of security measures is implemented to address each issue identified by visualizing security risks, and senior management, departments, and the CISO organization collaborate on a response through organic activities. This dual-loop includes, monitoring by senior managements through monthly reviews conducted during the Risk Management and Compliance Committee and Regular Meetings on Quality and Security Measures where senior management is directly involved. This enables security measures under the responsibility of the CISO to be considered as part of the business priorities and can be pursued with the same perspective as the senior management, thereby realizing a company-wide risk management cycle. Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 6-3-3 @Fujitsu 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 420 ===== Dual-Loop Company-Wide Security Risk Management Scheme <What Can be Realized through the ''Company-Wide Security Risk Management Scheme''> In the dual-loop of the Company-wide Security Risk Management Scheme, ''Risk visualization'' serves as a common checkpoint between the outer loop and the inner loop. By rotating the dual-loops starting from this checkpoint enables information security to be continuously maintained, improved, and enhanced. By continuing this cycle, the scheme becomes firmly established thus realizing a reform of the organizational culture. Outer loop (gray arrow) Control loop consist of a role to strengthen senior management involvement by making visualized risks available to senior management, and a role of risk management with security governance by the CISO organization. Inner loop (blue arrow) Autonomous loop to promote self-improvement (autonomous corrective activities based on principles) in each department to ensure correct understanding of the situation in their own department through highly objective risk visualization. Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 6-3-4 @Fujitsu 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 421 ===== <Visualization of Security Risks Using Technology> ''Visualization of security risks,'' is enabled by introduction of CMDB*2 and Information Management Dashboards*3 to digitally (mechanically) visualize risks such as the residual vulnerabilities of information systems and inappropriate information management practices. For example, if a vulnerability is detected through a process of matching the information system configuration information registered in the CMDB with the Vulnerability Database*4, the system management department is instructed to mitigate the vulnerability by issuing a remediation task ticket. The status after the remediation instruction is also visualized in the remaining vulnerability status dashboard to ensure successful completion of the remediation. If a particularly hazardous risk is detected through risk visualization, a timely and appropriate remedial solution will be implemented under the control of the management and the CISO. *2 CMDB: Configuration Management Database A database for collecting and consolidating configuration information on information systems, including hardware, software and network. The collected configuration information is used for security inspections/audits, vulnerability mitigation and security incident resolution. *3 Information Management Dashboard: A digitized information management ledger Fujitsu Group manages and utilizes an information management ledger that maintains inventory of confidential information, including name of administrators, storage locations and disclosure restrictions, in digital form. The system checks for consistency with the actual status of information management (e.g., audit logs for storage services) and alerts the managing department if any deficiencies are detected, thereby enabling an immediate response. *4 Vulnerability Database: A database that collects and consolidates known product vulnerabilities. Similarly, each department is also working to foster an organizational culture that encourages self-improvement based on risk visualization. The first step is to visualize and share the state of the organization's and individual employees' information management literacy (internal factors) as well as the actual state of cyber risks (external factors). (Visualization) Then, by having each employee correctly understand the visualized risks and take them personally (taking ownership), autonomous information security practices will be facilitated (taking the initiative). Repeatedly reinforcing this process while making improvements, will nurture an organizational culture with effective self-improvement.

Three Themes for Information Security Initiatives Cyber security Introduction of measures related to information system security (ensuring and maintaining the safety and reliability of information systems and networks), as well as security maintenance activities for Fujitsu products and services Information management Introduction of measures to maintain and manage the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information itself, including critical information (e.g., confidential information and personal information) Governance enhancement Introduction of governance enhancement measures to strengthen the security of the entire organization by disseminating and instilling the security practices. Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 6-3-6 @Fujitsu 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 423 ===== Cyber Security Based on the IT asset management information of Fujitsu’s systems, we will strengthen cyber security practices to prevent security breaches by providing perimeter defense and zero-trust security not only to block any unauthorized access by an attacker, but also to detect and take defensive actions in the event of such intrusion. Measures Linked to Centralized IT Asset Management <Autonomous Risk Remediation Through Centralized and Visualized IT Asset Management> To support our customers’ safe, secure, and sustainable business activities, we have centralized and visualized the IT asset management of the IT systems for our globally operating customers, as well as internal IT systems. This helps us promptly identify and remediate any security risks throughout the Fujitsu Group. We have been strengthening routine risk management, visualizing risk audits conducted by the CISO organization and their result, and promoting an appropriate understanding of the actual situation in each departments and their autonomous correction. Global IT Asset Management <Vulnerability Detection and Remediation> By providing vulnerability scanning process for systems (assets) directly accessible from the Internet using IT asset management information, each department that manages the system can autonomously conduct periodic scanning and implement remedial solutions triggered by vulnerability detection. Annual inspection using this process are conducted to ensure that vulnerability remediation practices are in place, and when high-risk vulnerabilities are detected, reliable solution will be implemented in a timely manner with the involvement of the CISO organization. Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 6-3-7 @Fujitsu 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 424 ===== In addition, by maintaining IT asset management information up to date on a regular basis and matching it with a vulnerability database, any vulnerabilities detected are reported to the relevant department via issued remediation task ticket, ensuring that all vulnerabilities are fully addressed. This process also makes it possible to detect vulnerabilities in systems (assets) that are not directly accessible from the Internet. As of the end of FY2023, we have completed implementing solutions to address the high-priority vulnerabilities*5 detected through this initiative for the systems in Japan. For international regions, remedial solutions are scheduled to be implemented by the end of FY2024. *5 High-priority vulnerabilities: High-risk vulnerabilities that remain in systems (assets) that are directly accessible from the Internet and that hold sensitive information such as personal data. Vulnerability Detection and Remediation <Utilization of Threat Intelligence and Attack Surface Management> We are proactively utilizing threat intelligence to speed up the detection of, and response to, vulnerabilities in systems exposed to the Internet. Threat intelligence enables us to collect information in the early stage of an actual attack from an attacker’s perspective, such as information on global threat trends and vulnerabilities as well as vulnerability information in Fujitsu Group’s systems exposed to the Internet. The obtained threat intelligence allows impact analysis and prompt remedial action. Moreover, in combination with vulnerability scanning of Internet-exposed systems based on IT asset management information, we also implement attack surface management, which monitors system vulnerabilities from an attacker’s perspective. Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 6-3-8 @Fujitsu 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 425 ===== Thorough Monitoring The cyber security environment is constantly changing, and attack methods are becoming more complex and sophisticated. Under such circumstances, the Fujitsu Group takes a zero-trust approach, based on the concept that 100% prevention of intrusion by cyber-attack is impossible, to reinforce security monitoring. We have established internal guidelines for security monitoring and conduct periodic system inspections to assess and visualize the current situation. We are also working to ensure a sound monitoring to enhance detection capabilities and enable timely response to cyber-attacks. Furthermore, we ensure that critical systems are thoroughly monitored through third-party inspections conducted by the CISO organization. As of the end of FY2023, we have completed enhancing and improving capabilities for detecting cyber attacks against critical systems in Japan. For international regions, formulation of a improvement plan was completed at the end of FY2023, and actual improvement is scheduled to be completed in accordance with the plan during FY2024. Response to Incidents As a company that supports the safe and secure business activities of our customers, we need to be able to respond immediately to increasingly advanced and sophisticated cyber attacks. For this reason, we have preemptively established an incident response policy, scheme, and procedures based on the assumption that security incidents may occur during normal times. This allows us to quickly implement a series of procedures in the event of an incident, including escalation, response, recovery, and notification (1) Escalation When a security incident is confirmed to have caused damage to the system managed by a department or to a personal terminal, the incident and the extent of the damage are assessed in according to preestablished procedures, and immediate emergency measures to be carried out, while also escalating the incident to the appropriate level. After escalation, support staff will be assigned by the Security Control Organization to assist with incident response, allowing them to work together to resolve the incident. Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 6-3-9 @Fujitsu 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 426 ===== (2) Incident response The Security Control Organization and the department managing the affected system cooperate to prevent the spread of damage by shutting down the affected system and/or disabling specific functions. The cause of the incident is investigated and eradicated thereafter. ( e.g., application of patches). (3) Recovery After eradicating the cause of the incident, system and business-related data are restored to resume the system and business operations to a normal state. (4) Notification Incident details is shared and reported to fulfill our accountability to stakeholders, including public authorities, affected customers, and business partners. The Incident Response Handbook & Guidelines, which defines the above incident response policies and procedures has been developed and deployed in Japan by FY2023. Versions for international regions will be released and deployed by FY2024 after making alignment with the specific requirements of each country. Incident Response Procedure Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 6-3-10 @Fujitsu 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 427 ===== <Sophistication of Incident Response> Responding to a security incident requires an accurate understanding of the event from a technical perspective through log analysis, malware analysis, disk forensics, and other methods. A quick and fitting response also requires determining an overall policy and collaborating with parties involved inside and outside the company. At Fujitsu, technical experts and members who take the lead on the path to the solution work together to respond to security incidents, following several processes, including the escalation process. We have been accumulating data on attacker’s tools, processes, and access methods and improving technical knowledge and skills of our response team members through continuous training. We also conduct reviews of the result of past incidents we have handled with our global group companies to continuously improve our incident response capabilities, including upgrading our structure, rule and processes and accumulating know-how, to enable immediate responses and minimize the impact of incidents. Risk Prevention in Our Products and Services <xSIRT Regime> To protect customers who use Fujitsu's products and services, we centrally manage product configuration information, IT asset information, and threat intelligence information, which includes vulnerability information. In addition, to enable prompt and proactive response to risks arising from vulnerabilities in products and services, we have established an xSIRT*6 regime by assigning PSIRT managers and System Security Managers, who are responsible for managing vulnerabilities in their departments. *6 xSIRT: Security Incident Response Team An organization or regime that handles incidents that affect products and services offered by Fujitsu. It plays a similar role to PSIRT, while xSIRT covers wider range of cases. <Process Formulation> In order to estimate risks to products and services, and to promptly consider and execute countermeasures against vulnerabilities based on risks to products and services, we have established criteria and processes for addressing risks associated with vulnerabilities, and are continuously improving these processes based on statistical analysis and our past incident response results. Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 6-3-11 @Fujitsu 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 428 ===== With these regime and processes in place, we ensure prompt remediation of vulnerabilities in order to shorten the vulnerability response time and resolve them in a timely manner, thereby preventing secondary damage to our customers and minimizing the impact on their business continuity. As an example of the successful achievements of implementing this solution, at the time when a vulnerability-induced cyber attack occurred in the past, which caused significant damage and had an impact worldwide and resulted in a major risk warning from CISA*7, Fujitsu was able to quickly identify the affected system and took appropriate remedial action to avoid damage from information exploitation. *7 CISA: The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Vulnerability Response Framework in Fujitsu Products and Services Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 6-3-12 @Fujitsu 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 429 ===== Information Protection Management Systems (7 Points) Information Management Fujitsu Group in Japan implemented the Information Protection Management System in order to appropriately protect third-party confidential information (including personal information) and our confidential information. We also apply a PDCA cycle that covers from the “(1) Roles & Responsibilities” to ”(7) Review”. In order to clarify information assets that must be protected, we establish appropriate management according to the status of our customers and suppliers, and take initiatives for protecting information. These steps are taken for the autonomous information protection activities (regulations by industry, business type, etc.) conducted by each division while unifying the classification of information on a global scale. Furthermore, we utilize various automation support tools such as information management dashboards to support appropriate information management, while also making improvements as necessary to realize effective and secure operations.

Protection of Personal Information Fujitsu has established a global Personal Information Protection System to strengthen the protection of personal data. Under the leadership of the CISO organization and the Legal Division, we work with each region and Group company to comply with the laws and regulations of each country, including the GDPR*9. In regard to the handling of personal information, we post and announce privacy policies on public websites in each country. *9 GDPR: General Data Protection Regulation A European regulation that was put into effect on May 25, 2018 a nd that requires companies, organizations, and groups to protect personal data. Includes rules on the transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) and the obligation to report within 72 hours of a data leakage at cybersecurity incidents.

To ensure common governance in the global group, we clarify what must be done by “(1) making policy requirements mandatory,” and make sure “(2) thorough governance” under the Information Security Management Structure. By organically combining these with “(3) execution of inspections and audits,” mentioned earlier, and “(4) issue detection through ASM,” we realize reliable security measures that each department can carry out autonomously. In addition, by “(5) visualizing risks and maturity levels“ along with metering of security maturity levels, we foster a culture of taking security measures autonomously and thus promote self- improvement effect of cyber-security measures. Overall Picture of Governance Enhancement Measures Metering of Security Maturity Levels Fujitsu leverages the Security Risk and Maturity Monitor to monitor the status of various security measures as a method to facilitate smooth promotion of strengthening organizational governance (common interface of the dual-loop) through the Company-wide Security Risk Management Scheme. Two functions of the monitor are; a Risk Monitor to visualize risks, and a Maturity Monitor to visualize maturity levels. This enables both management and each department to identify risks and check maturity levels using the same yardstick. Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 6-3-17 @Fujitsu 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 434 ===== <Risk Monitor> The Risk Monitor provides a comprehensive view of each department at Fujitsu headquarters and Group companies and visualizes numerical values of risks. For risks detected by the aforementioned vulnerability scanning, the number of cases still requiring remediation is displayed on a heat map and graph according to their criticallity, allowing for prioritizing and mitigating risks with high severity. <Maturity Monitor> The Maturity Monitor digitally scores factors such as the occurrence of vulnerabilities and the speed with which vulnerabilities are remediated. By visualizing the maturity level of each department at Fujitsu headquarters and Group companies on a monthly basis, we foster a culture of autonomous implementation of specific solutions and corrective actions based on an understanding of current circumstances and gaps from targets, and promote self-improvement for cybersecurity practices in each department. Inspired by the C2M2*11 , or Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, and SIM3*12 , or Security Incident Management Maturity Model, both of which have been proven globally, our security maturity level evaluation indicators incorporate a unique method of scoring maturity mechanically from data taken from our security measures. The maturity levels are scored on six axes: governance, human security risk management, system security risk management, information asset risk management, incident detection and response capabilities, and organizational culture and mindset. In addition to Fujitsu's internal metering described above, we aim to strengthen our cybersecurity incident response capabilities by using external security rating services to continuously check Fujitsu's security scoring, which is highly objective from a third-party perspective. *11 C2M2：Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model *12 SIM3：Security Incident Management Maturity Model Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 6-3-18 @Fujitsu 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 435 ===== The following is an example image from the Maturity Monitor. Company Maturity Maturity Score Trends (Entire Company) Visualized Graph of Security Maturity Levels (sample) Ensuring Awareness and Understanding of Frameworks, Rules and Processes Fujitsu is implementing mainly two initiatives to unify and raise the level of information security measures on a global basis. <Fujitsu Group Standards for Information Security Measures> The first is the formulation of “Fujitsu Group Standards for Information Security Measures” which set the standard security measures in the group. Consisting of 165 m anagement measures based on the global standards NIST’s*13  CSF *14 , SP800-53 *15  and ISO/IEC27002, the application of management measures according to the importance of information systems and other factors is standardized. Materials such as manuals and guidelines to support the application of such management measures are also available. Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 6-3-19 @Fujitsu 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 436 ===== <Risk Management Framework> The second is the development of “Risk Management Framework,” a framework for security risk management in the group. Based on the global standards NIST’s SP800-37*16  , the framework defines a set of processes to identify and manage security risks of each organization and information system in a systematic and appropriate manner. Within this set of processes, periodic risk management in each organization and risk management in the development and operation phases of each information system are being standardized. We incorporate these set of processes into the Fujitsu Group’s various business processes to ensure that they are well understood and widely accepted. In Japan, this ''Risk Management Framework'' has been in operation since FY2023, and we plan to expand its operation to international regions in FY2024. By sharing these two initiatives within the Fujitsu Group and executing a series of processes of “Risk Management Framework,” management measures based on the “Fujitsu Group Standards for Information Security Measures” are applied to each organization and information system, while running a continuous improvement process. This contribute with our pursuit for effective implementation of security measures and realization of “security by design.” *13 NIST : National Institute of Standards and Technology *14 CSF : Cybersecurity Framework *15 SP800-53 : NIST SP800-53 Rev.5 Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations *16 SP800-37 : NIST SP800-37 Rev.2 Risk Management Framework Security Training, Development of Mindset, Human Resource Development and Maturity of Responsible Personnel As one of the measures to support the improvement of security maturity levels, mentioned above, we are engaged in promoting security education and training. Particularly, we focus on preventing the recurrence of recent incidents. For example, our company-wide mandatory information security education program shares the latest trends of security threats and incident cases and informs trainees of the lessons learned from the past incident responses and the measures that were supposed to be taken, in order to develop a security mindset and strengthen skills of each employee. Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 FUJITSU-PUBLIC 6-3-20 @Fujitsu 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 437 ===== <Security Education and Training> In addition to providing basic education on information management and cyber-security, we thoroughly disseminate the lessons learned from the latest trends and incident responses. We also work to improve the skills of our professional personnel by issuing guidelines on system monitoring for system managers. As incidents cannot be 100% prevented, we have shifted our approach from “efforts to prevent contingencies”, to “efforts based on the premise that contingencies will occur”, thereby strengthening our company-wide incident response capabilities. As part of this effort, the Fujitsu Group conducts company-wide training for executives and employees every six months. Specifically, with the aim of responding quickly and minimizing the impact of incidents that have a social impact, we conduct incident drills in which executives and personnel from various departments participate. We also provide practical training scenarios for SEs and business producers who are involved in external business and internal operations. Insights gained from these training sessions are reflected as appropriate in the Incident Response Handbook & Guidelines described in the ''Incident Response'' section, and are shared with each department. In addition, targeted e-mail drills are conducted on an ongoing basis to foster a security mindset among each employee. *Number of training sessions conducted in FY2023: 2 times company-wide training sessions, 1 time targeted e-mail training session <Strengthening Information Security Structure and Human Resource Development> In an effort to change employees’ mindsets and behavior regarding information security within the Fujitsu Group, the CISO and the CISO organization regularly disseminate information internally, and security measures are taken through security managers assigned to each department. In 2023, we revised the Professional Certification System to redefine our image of the ideal security personnel, especially security managers assigned in each department. After clarifying security managers' roles and responsibilities and revising their compensation and other aspects, we have been reinforcing security structures in organizations in Japan ahead of international regions since January 2023. In addition to sharing the actual status of each organization through visualization using the aforementioned ''security maturity metering,'' we are working with each department to improve their security maturity level through regular communication within the security managers' community and through security managers' meetings and subcommittee meetings.

Following the decision and direction of the CQO, the Global Quality Management & Assurance Unit formulates common policies, standardization, and quality improvement measures as the headquarters of quality. By deploying these common measures through QMRs with close collaboration, we strive toward more field-oriented implementation and application, and perform quality management in an effort to provide products/services with consistent and optimal quality for our customers.

Frameworks and mechanisms to integrate these organizations are essential as a foundation for our efforts. This is why we built our Quality Management System (QMS): to coordinate among these business units as appropriate for the product or service. Our QMS periodically verifies the progress in light of international certification standards such as the ISO in the aim of achieving process improvements to realize even higher quality. Companywide Quality Improvement Cycle The Fujitsu Group’s quality improvement efforts consist of activities based on the Quality Policy by our Companywide Quality Department (Companywide Quality Department Quality Improvement Efforts in the diagram below) and activities to develop and implement quality management systems for each business group (Business Group Quality Improvement Efforts sections of the Companywide Quality Improvement Cycle diagram). These elements turn the cycle, with the entire Group working collaboratively and strategically to improve quality. FUJITSU-PUBLIC 6-4-4 @Fujitsu 2024 Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 442 ===== A. Quality policy planning Quality objectives are set and reviewed, and quality strategies and policies for achieving them are planned and rolled out across the entire Fujitsu Group. In addition, we monitor and manage activities to ensure they are conducted in accordance with our Quality Policy. B. Quality process regulation/standardization/control Based on our Quality Policy, we are making progress with the standardization of specific processes and techniques in key areas targeted for improvement. We implement and control these standards at the locations where we operate. Additionally, also in line with our Quality Policy, we promote activities to improve quality across our business groups. Furthermore, in addition to developing and disseminating quality-related standards, we also share best practices derived from successful projects, so that they can be widely utilized. Further, we promote the sharing of knowledge and project standardization through lessons learned from unsuccessful projects in a manner readily accessible to anyone. C. Monitoring/independent audits We monitor the projects of each business group, identify risks to quality at an early stage, escalate issues found, and implement countermeasures as needed. Any concerns regarding quality are addressed by a third party, who audits / conducts an inspection of the items involved, whereby we carry out corrections and improvements. <In the event of a serious quality issue with any product/service we provide our customers> Following the Risk Management Regulations, the matter is immediately reported from the field to the Risk Management & Compliance Committee at the Fujitsu Headquarters. Under the direction of the Committee, the relevant departments address the incident jointly and consider ways to prevent recurrence. The recurrence prevention measures are shared with other departments through QMR in an effort to prevent the same incident from occurring at other Fujitsu Group companies. D. Evaluation/improvement We regularly examine and analyze our approach to quality and consider additional measures if necessary, directing the QMR to make improvements based on the business characteristics of each organization. After reporting updates to executive management on a regular basis, action is taken following their decision making and instructions. Additionally, through Qfinity (Note 1) activity, good/best practices are commended and shared across the entire Fujitsu Group to increase the level of quality throughout the Group. FUJITSU-PUBLIC 6-4-5 @Fujitsu 2024 Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2024 Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 443 ===== Mechanism for Objectively Assessing Field Decisions Note 1: Qfinity Qfinity, an internal branding term which combines the words “quality” and “infinity,” represents the DNA of the Fujitsu Group: the “infinite pursuit of quality by each and every employee.” Qfinity is an improvement and innovation activity launched throughout the Fujitsu Group in FY 2001 to continuously improve the quality of products and services, with each and every employee taking a central role. Through Qfinity, we promote quality improvement activities in each workplace and engage in quality improvement of products and services. Quality Governance Under the CQO, we are working to strengthen quality governance across the Fujitsu Group as well as prevent major incidents from reoccurring and enhancing the quality of products/services. The process of strengthening quality governance involves rolling out a common platform to assess quality risk and the quality assurance process that supports service delivery within the Fujitsu Group to correctly assess risks and take thorough action against it. As the number of challenges in new area of business increases and information systems become more complex, we use these mechanisms as a base to make swift and appropriate decisions and prepare for a variety of risks. Strengthening the Design/Operation Platform Supporting Quality Governance and Risk Monitoring We will consolidate quality-related information that we obtain in the development field, such as progress of development projects, test density, and defect detection rate, onto our common platform, Fujitsu Developers Platform. By combining this information with Earned Value Management (EVM) and quality indicators and conducting timely analysis, we will build a mechanism for assessing the quality and delivery decisions in the development field in a more objective manner.

One Delivery manages projects in accordance with the shared “One Delivery Quality Assurance Process” to enable centralized risk management. The One Delivery Quality Assurance Process embodies four key steps based on past quality issue trends. First, “Resource management” aims to prevent skills mismatch and similar problems. Next, the “GOGI Approval system” determines the promotion of business opportunities and projects from an objective and multifaceted perspective. “Technology control” then aims to improve technological appropriateness and feasibility. Finally, through “business opportunity and quality monitoring”, we detect at an early stage those projects with potential troubles. We are working to apply and improve the One Delivery Quality Assurance Process, enabling the entire Group to provide higher-quality, more stable services.

Number of disclosed issues: 0 major product incidents Important notices concerning product safety Prevention Measures for Laptop Battery Ignition Incidents On three previous occasions, Fujitsu has asked customers to exchange and return battery packs in order to prevent the spread of ignition incidents due to the possibility that foreign matter had contaminated the interior of the battery during the battery pack manufacturing process. At the same time, however, although extremely rare, there have been cases of ignition occurring in battery packs outside those covered by the returns and exchanges. It has been found that limiting the phenomena that increase the internal pressure of batteries is an effective measure in preventing these types of ignition incidents. Since February 9, 2017, F ujitsu has been offering a ''Battery Charging Control Update Tool'' through its website for its laptop PCs launched between 2010 a nd 2016.

Independent Assurance Report  To the Representative Director CEO of Fujitsu Limited  We were engaged by Fujitsu Limited (the “Company”) to undertake a limited assurance engagement of the  environmental and social performance indicators marked with ★ (the “Indicators”) for the period from April 1,  2023 to March 31, 2024 included in its Sustainability Data Book 2024 (the “Report”) for the fiscal year ended  March 31, 2024.  The Company’s Responsibility  The Company is responsible for the preparation of the Indicators in accordance with its own reporting criteria  (the “Company’s reporting criteria”), as described in the Report.  Our Responsibility  Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Indicators based on the procedures we  have performed. We conducted our engagement in accordance with the ‘International Standard on Assurance  Engagements (ISAE) 3000, Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial  Information’ and the ‘ISAE 3410, Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements’ issued by the  International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. The limited assurance engagement consisted of making  inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for the preparation of information presented in the Report, and  applying analytical and other procedures, and the procedures performed vary in nature from, and are less in  extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. The level of assurance provided is thus not as high as that  provided by a reasonable assurance engagement. Our assurance procedures included:  ⚫Interviewing the Company’s responsible personnel to obtain an understanding of its policy for preparing the Report and reviewing the Company’s reporting criteria. ⚫Inquiring about the design of the systems and methods used to collect and process the Indicators. ⚫Performing analytical procedures on the Indicators. ⚫Examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the generation, aggregation and reporting of the Indicators in conformity with the Company’s reporting criteria, and recalculating the Indicators. ⚫Visiting FDK Corporation’s Tottori Plant selected on the basis of a risk analysis. ⚫Evaluating the overall presentation of the Indicators. Conclusion  Based on the procedures performed, as described above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to  believe that the Indicators in the Report are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the  Company’s reporting criteria as described in the Report.

Amid the  accelerating evolution of digital technology and significant changes in the business  environment, the Group is shifting from a product-centric business model to one  focused on consulting and solutions. Over the past 20 years, we have spun off or  sold non-core businesses, focusing management resources on growth areas and  improving efficiency, which has led to increased profitability. In fiscal 2023, we  incurred one-time costs in connection with business restructuring, but adjusted  operating profit from focused businesses has increased, and we are steadily pro­ gressing toward our goals. In addition, we are pursuing sustainable growth and  enhanced corporate value through proactive growth investments based on our  greatly heightened cash generation capabilities. 	 These transformations have been well received by the stock market, and our  share price has risen significantly to approximately 3.1 times over the last five years.

Looking ahead to 2030, we have identified three areas for the Fujitsu Group’s  essential contributions (Materiality): Planet (solving global environmental issues),  Prosperity (developing a digital society), and People (improving people’s well-being).  To achieve our goals in these three areas, we will strengthen our technology, man­ agement foundation, and human capital as the sources of value creation, while  supporting the creation of new business models and spurring innovation. We organized social issues looking ahead to 2030 and conducted surveys and interviews with a wide  range of internal and external stakeholders to identify our Materiality in terms of the mutual impacts  of corporations and the environment and society. Going forward, we will conduct periodic reviews on  an annual basis and revise as necessary. Organization and  identification of  social issues List social issues based on  the SDGs and other refer­ ences, and narrow them  down based on relevance  to the business. Prioritization  Assessment by internal and  external stakeholders to  create a Materiality matrix.

First, we answered the question of “What  sort of company does Fujitsu want to become?” by  unveiling our vision for 2030: being a technology  company that realizes net positive through digital  ­services and expressing this vision both internally and  externally. Second, after organizing social issues look­ ing toward 2030, we identified the main priorities for  the Group as our Materiality, and developed a frame­ work for providing value to society through our busi­ ness. Third, backcasting from our vision for 2030, we  formulated and launched the 2023–2025 Medium- Term Management Plan (medium-term plan). 	 The medium-term plan covers a three-year period  building a business model for sustainable growth and  improved profitability with a view to 2030 and  beyond, preparing us for a leap forward from fiscal  2026. Our goal is to shift from a business model that  primarily focuses on traditional labor-intensive system  integration to one that provides high added value to  customers through cloud-based digital services. Emerging changes in the business structure in  fiscal 2023 Our results for fiscal 2023, the first year under the  medium-term plan, demonstrate that we are making  progress on transforming our business model. The  Fujitsu Uvance business, which will play a leading role  Message from the CEO We will achieve sustainable growth and increase corporate value  by accelerating our rate of change and enhancing the value we provide  to our customers and the society that exists beyond them.

We  expect continued growth in fiscal 2024, along with  deeper confidence in establishing a new business  model for the Group. We are also focusing on mod­ ernization, which means helping customers optimize  their IT infrastructure with the latest technologies and  new products and services so they can transform their  business models by utilizing data. Customers tend to  take a cautious approach toward IT asset optimization  because it affects the very foundations of their busi­ ness. As a result, growth in this market is somewhat  slower than anticipated. Even so, in fiscal 2023 we  reinforced our structure, which included an increase in  headcount, and upgraded our tools to meet the  robust demand we expect going forward. We plan to  leverage these enhanced resources to take advantage  of the market’s expansion from fiscal 2024. 	 The 2.0 percentage point improvement in gross  profit margin for the Service Solutions segment,  which we position as a growth area, is evidence of  success in our shift towards a more profitability- focused business model. This improvement is attrib­ utable to delivery transformation initiatives such as  standardization and automation of development pro­ cesses, leveraging Global Delivery Centers (GDCs),  and value pricing, which have contributed to  enhanced profitability. 	 On the other hand, frankly speaking, we are only  midway along the path to making our overseas busi­ ness more profitable. We have already completed  structural reforms in the Americas. Using this region as  a leading model, we are accelerating our business port­ folio transformation in Europe to improve profitability  and considering reforms in the Asia Pacific region. 	 We take the matter relating to the post office in the  United Kingdom, a core part of the Europe region,  extremely seriously. The Group’s involvement in this  matter is deeply regrettable and we recognize our  moral responsibility. The Group is cooperating fully  with the statutory investigation in the United  Kingdom, and will disclose information to stakeholders  as appropriate after the outcome of the investigation. Our intention in setting high goals In fiscal 2023, growth of the Service Solutions segment  outpaced the market, and key non-financial indicators  such as Customer Net Promoter Score (NPS®)*1 also  improved. On this basis, we might say that manage­ ment is performing well. However, I am by no means  satisfied with the status quo. I believe that the Group’s  transformation will accelerate only when all of its busi­ ness divisions take on the challenge of achieving  higher levels of performance, and when we have  greater collaboration among business divisions and  between business and corporate divisions. 	 This is the thinking behind the high financial tar­ gets in our plan for fiscal 2023. We fell short of the  planned targets in some areas, which is grounds for  reflection. I consider it my responsibility as a manager  to set goals that encourage all employees to take on  challenges and grow, and then to achieve these goals  to meet the expectations and earn the trust of  shareholders, investors, and other stakeholders. *1 Net Promoter®, NPS®, NPS Prism®, and the images and symbols used in connection  with NPS are registered trademarks of Bain & Company, Fred Reichheld, and NICE  Systems, Inc.

We are outlining a business  vision that looks to 2030 and even beyond—to a  point in the longer-term future after society has  become carbon neutral. We have formulated a  growth strategy considering what services are  required to get to that point, what technologies are  necessary, and what human capital is required to  offer them. We are making steady progress toward  realizing this strategy, and we are demonstrating the  Group’s competitive advantages in the process. 	 One of the Group’s competitive advantages is tech­ nological expertise. We have been researching artificial  intelligence (AI) since the 1980s, and have integrated  the results of this research into Fujitsu Uvance and its  practical application as a service that customers can  actually use. For instance, in June 2024 we announced  several generative AI technologies, including the spe­ cialized automatic generative AI tailored to corporate  needs utilizing the world’s first technology. Highlighting  our R&D capabilities involving cutting-edge technolo­ gies, in October 2023 we unveiled development of a  64-qubit superconducting quantum computer offering  service through a platform that can be linked to  a quantum simulator. We are also making steady R&D  progress on a next-generation, high-performance,  power-saving processor tentatively dubbed the  FUJITSU-MONAKA. 	 Another notable competitive advantage is our cus­ tomer base and positioning in the Japanese market.  The Group maintains the top share of the IT services  market and has established a dominant position in the  domestic market for the development and manufac­ ture of mainframes and UNIX servers. Although this is  now referred to as “legacy” hardware, the relation­ ships of trust with customers and deep understanding  of their businesses we have built through the con­ struction and operation of mission-critical systems  have lasting value. These relationships are important  because they prepare the ground for new proposals.  The responsibility to support the digital transforma­ tion (DX) of long-time customers through our hard­ ware and systems integration business and the  potential for offering new value through sustainability  transformation (SX) are major business opportunities  for the Group. 	 The Group’s extremely robust alliances with global  IT companies are due in part to their high regard for  these competitive advantages. Even global companies  with strong platforms and solutions can find it difficult  to deliver that value in a way that benefits customers  in Japan. This is where the Group’s expertise comes  into play: developing advanced applications that  leverage platforms and implementing proposals and  solutions that address customers’ business challenges.  The Group’s combination of technical capabilities,  customer base, and market positioning make it a  unique match for alliance partners seeking to provide  IT services in the Japanese market. Transforming our business portfolio and  ­accelerating the commercialization of AI I mentioned that Fujitsu Uvance, a business model  that is geared toward structural changes in society  and industry, is gaining customer acceptance, which  is producing strong results. This success is due in part  to our approach—we invited our customers’ manage­ ment teams to the Fujitsu Uvance experience space  at our headquarters to view demonstrations—as well  as to the fact that we now have a full menu of service  offerings. That said, I honestly believe this rollout was  a year late, based on our assumptions when we  announced Fujitsu Uvance in 2021. To translate our  competitive advantages into medium- and long-term  growth, we need to step up the pace of change. With  consulting services that are integral to customer  negotiations now in full swing under the new Uvance  Wayfinders brand, and with an increased variety of  offerings, in fiscal 2024 we will accelerate the trans­ formation of our business portfolio centered on  Fujitsu Uvance. 	 AI is also key to increasing the value Fujitsu Uvance  provides to customers. We believe that by 2030,  The potential for offering new  value through sustainability  ­transformation (SX) is a   major business opportunity for   the Group.

Accordingly, we need to step up our investment in  growth, especially in AI. We need to put AI and other  technologies to practical use more quickly. We will  integrate our proprietary technology into Fujitsu  Uvance to add value to our customers, differentiate  our services, and aim for the top position in  AI-related services for the Japanese market. 	 We will accelerate our business portfolio transfor­ mation and continue to improve system quality, which  is a cornerstone of customer trust. Under the lead of  the CQO (Chief Quality Officer), the Group has contin­ uously reviewed and promoted measures to enhance  system quality. Of course, we also need to use data to  explain to customers how our initiatives are enhancing  quality. We welcome honest feedback from customers  and society as well as suggestions on areas we need  to improve. I believe this is how a technology com­ pany should fulfill its responsibility to continuously  strive for quality that meets customers’ expectations. Utilizing the practical knowledge we have  ­accumulated through data-driven management The Group is promoting the core OneFujitsu program  in its quest for data-driven management. In addition  to OneCRM, which has been operating in all regions  since April 2022, OneERP+, the Group’s backbone  system, will go live in October 2024 starting in Japan.  This system will further augment the real-time visual­ ization of business operations, which we have already  partially achieved. It will also enhance the ease of  system maintenance and operation, and our response  capability and the speed with which we address  changes in the environment through system updates  and revisions. More than anything, we look forward to  increasing productivity through further progress in  standardizing the business processes we have been  working on under the OneFujitsu program. 	 The benefits of the OneFujitsu program go beyond  the Group’s own productivity gains. The experience  and knowledge acquired through our internal prac­ tices serve as a reference for our customers and help  strengthen our consulting capabilities, which is a key  focus for the Group. In particular, we have gained  valuable practical knowledge through the Group’s  trial-and-error process of introducing 3S: SAP,  ServiceNow, and Salesforce.*2 In addition to the tech­ nology needed to implement 3S, we have gained  extremely broad-based knowledge, such as in how to  make the most of 3S, how to adjust business pro­ cesses to take advantage of them, and how to culti­ vate the personnel who use them in corporate  divisions, such as accounting and human resources,  and in front office sales division. I am convinced that  by taking up the challenge of DX to move away from  legacy systems and by utilizing the practical knowl­ edge we have gained by repeatedly overcoming  obstacles, we can outshine our competitors in provid­ ing consulting services that are more responsive to  customers’ issues and needs. *2 A business application that encapsulates enterprise resource management (ERP),  customer service management (CSM), and customer relationship management  (CRM) We will . . . aim for the top position  in AI-related services for the  Japanese market. By utilizing the practical   knowledge we have gained  repeatedly overcoming obstacles,   we can outshine our competitors  in providing consulting services  that are more responsive to   customers’ issues and needs.

The forward-looking  reinforcement of management functions is part of  this preparation. To this end, in April 2024 we put in  place a new management leadership structure com­ posed of five vice presidents, as well as myself. The  aim is to further increase management efficiency and  speed up decision-making by delineation according  to function. 	 In addition to the CFO, who specializes in finance,  and the CTO, who is responsible for accelerating the  commercialization of technology, we have clarified  functional responsibility in the Service Solutions seg­ ment, which is a growth area. We have assigned three  vice presidents to handle the individual functions of  consulting, Fujitsu Uvance, and modernization. We  believe this arrangement will enable us to change  course more swiftly, as fluctuations in the business  environment necessitate. The team of five will work  together as a team, while also engaging in robust  debate, toward the common goal of transforming the  Group, which is a massive entity with more than  120,000 employees. The resolve embodied in net positive We must continue to embrace the challenge of creat­ ing value and achieving medium- to long-term  growth. “Net positive,” a phrase used in our vision for  2030, expresses this belief. The outcomes of the  Group’s business activities are not unfailingly positive.  For example, the spread of cloud services has caused  power consumption to rise. We believe, however, that  we should wholeheartedly embrace businesses that  help society and generate overall positive value that  outweighs negative impacts. If we stop taking on  challenges for fear of repercussions, in addition to  neglecting one of the most important tenets of the  Fujitsu Way, we will be left behind in a rapidly chang­ ing society and be unable to achieve Our Purpose. 	 Since becoming president, we hold town hall  meetings for employees to entrench these ideas  throughout the Group. To truly internalize these con­ cepts, though, employees need to embrace them in  their work. As a leader, I need to set high goals while  clearly outlining a growth strategy, and continue to  encourage behavioral change among employees. I  believe our employees will come to realize the impor­ tance of challenges that contribute to net positive  while taking action to achieve our goals and discover­ ing and solving problems independently as we pro­ mote our growth strategy toward 2030. 	 The Group will continue its transformation toward  2030. We will persevere in our efforts to address  global environmental problems, develop a digital  society, and improve people’s well-being. We aim to  create a positive impact on society as a whole and  sustainably enhance corporate value. We expect to  realize Our Purpose as the culmination of these  efforts. I encourage our stakeholders to follow  Fujitsu’s developments with interest.

Our business model and portfolio strategy aims to strengthen our business foun­ dation by expanding service areas, specifically targeting growth in the Fujitsu Uvance  and modernization businesses. Our customer success/regional strategy is focused on  strengthening our global customer engagement and support which includes pro­ moting and expanding our consulting talent, beginning in Japan, whilst in parallel  shifting our international business to a services focus. Our technology strategy is  focused on increasing the value we provide to customers by leveraging Fujitsu’s  ­competitive advantages in technology. We are developing five Key Technologies  centered around AI, and embedding them within Fujitsu Uvance solutions and  ­services. Our people strategy aims to strengthen our business foundations by  ­establishing a global workforce portfolio that is connected to our business needs,  and improving productivity through Fujitsu’s own digital transformation (DX).

In the Service Solutions segment, Fujitsu Uvance  grew in addition to expansion in the DX and modernization busi­ nesses, especially in Japan. In the Hardware Solutions segment,  revenue for system products increased owing in part to the  impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, while for  ­network products, revenue declined on a pullback in demand  from strong levels in the previous fiscal year. Revenue in the  Device Solutions segment also declined amid weak demand for  semiconductor packages. In fiscal 2023, adjusted operating profit decreased year on year.  In the Service Solutions segment, which the Group has posi­ tioned as a key driver of growth, profit increased sharply on the  back of higher sales and steady improvement in the profitability  of domestic services. However, due to lower operating rates and  volumes in Device Solutions, drop in demand in network ­products,  and increase in costs associated with aggressive business growth  investments, profit fell on a consolidated basis. Core free cash flow totaled ¥197.2 billion in fiscal 2023, a year-on- year increase of ¥40.1 billion. Cash flows from operating activities  improved compared with the previous fiscal year as inventories  were reduced and accounts receivable were collected, despite an  increase in corporate tax payments due to higher profit last fiscal  year. As for cash flows from investing activities, expenditure  increased from the previous fiscal year due to increased capital  expenditures in the Device Solutions segment.

We  have achieved a 41.6% reduction as of fiscal 2023. In order to improve the customer experience, the Group targets  a 20-point improvement in the Customer Net Promoter Score  (NPS) by fiscal 2025 compared with the fiscal 2022 level. As of  fiscal 2023, NPS had improved by 7.7 points. As an indicator to measure sustained growth, the Group intends  to achieve its target of 75, the benchmark for global companies,  by fiscal 2025. As of fiscal 2023, this indicator was 69 points. In addition to Scope 1 and 2, the Group has set targets for reduc­ ing Scope 3 emissions by fiscal 2025, aiming to cut emissions by  12.5% compared with the fiscal 2020 level. As of fiscal 2023, we  have achieved a 34.2% reduction, surpassing this target. The Group aims to increase adjusted operating profit per  employee by 40% by fiscal 2025 compared with the fiscal 2022  level. This metric declined 11% on a consolidated basis in fiscal  2023, but exceeded 40% in the growth area of Service Solutions. To realize an equitable and inclusive corporate culture, the Group  tracks the ratio of women in management positions as an indica­ tor of diversity in human resources, targeting a ratio of 20% by  fiscal 2025.

Based on this belief, the Group has inte­ grated non-financial targets into the core of its business activities, and is promoting  efforts to achieve these goals along with financial targets. In the medium-term plan,  we have set targets for non-financial management indicators, such as for GHG emis­ sion reductions, Customer NPS, operating profit per employee, employee engage­ ment, and diversity leadership (ratio of female managers). We monitor our progress  toward these goals. 	 To achieve non-financial goals, it is necessary for each and every employee to  understand the importance of non-financial initiatives. Recognizing the need to clar­ ify the logic of non-financial goals in order to increase understanding of their impor­ tance, we established an internal task force in January 2022 composed of members  responsible for each non-financial management indicator and internal system devel­ opers. This task force has facilitated robust discussions among diverse members with  varying expertise, with the intention of establishing a framework for shedding light  on and understanding the relationship between non-financial and financial indicators,  ultimately integrating these findings into business models and operations. Initially,  we used data to analyze and verify correlations and causal relationships between  non-financial and financial indicators, exploring how non-financial indicators can be  improved and their relationship with financial indicators. 	 In fiscal 2023, we have taken a more concrete approach to clarify the story of how  non-financial initiatives impact other non-financial indicators and financial indicators.  We established two narrative hypotheses from the perspectives of the importance  and measurability of our initiatives: one starts with human capital initiatives and  another with climate change initiatives. Based on these narrative hypotheses, we are  further analyzing and verifying the relationships between the KPIs related to each ini­ tiative, non-financial management indicators, and financial indicators, such as revenue  and operating profit margin. 	 These initiatives are reported to the Sustainability Management Committee,  chaired by the CEO, and the results of discussions in this committee are reflected in  the task force’s initiatives. ESG Management Platform The Group has created the ESG Management Platform with the aim of facilitating  business decisions and organizational management, in addition to engagement with  external parties, including information disclosure, through the unified collection of  financial and non-financial indicators, as well as the visualization, analysis, and simu­ lation of data. While coordinating with the task force for non-financial indicators, the  Group measures progress on financial and non-financial management indicators,  analyzes story hypotheses and visualizes the results of simulations. 	 This initiative is a part of data-driven management activities that the Group is  targeting, and has led to the provision of services to customers that utilize know-how  gained through practical experience internally.

Based on the  2023–2025 Medium-Term Management Plan, we will  steadily invest in business growth and shareholder  returns, growing Service Solutions and enhancing  profitability. At the same time, we intend to fulfill  stakeholders’ expectations by achieving our financial  targets for fiscal 2025, a milestone on the path  toward 2030. 24 Fujitsu Integrated Report 2024  ===== PAGE 26 ===== 77.9 77.9 86.6 86.6 97.6 97.6 (11%) (11%) (13%) (13%) 105.1 105.1 (8%) (8%) 125.6 125.6 (20%)  (20%)  140 120 100 80 0 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 (Fiscal years) 13.5 13.5 15.1 15.1 12.0 12.0 13.5 13.5 15.2  15.2  16 14 12 10 0 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 (Fiscal years) Message from the CFO  We will focus on the growth area of  Service Solutions to realize sustainable  increases in corporate value. Takeshi Isobe  Representative Director CFO Performance in fiscal 2023, our starting point  for growth Looking at our consolidated financial results for fiscal  2023, revenue grew 2.2% year on year to ¥3,756.0  ­billion, excluding the impact of business restructuring,  and profit attributable to owners of the parent climbed  18.3% to ¥254.4 billion, reaching record highs. Adjusted  operating profit, which excludes business restructuring  and other transient factors, fell 11.6% to ¥283.6 billion,  and the adjusted operating profit margin was 7.6%. As  a result, adjusted earnings per share (EPS) came to  ¥125.6, and return on equity (ROE) was 15.2%. 	 Honing in on performance by business segment,  revenue and profit grew substantially in Service  Solutions, which we are focusing on as a growth area.  Excluding the impact of business restructuring,  ­segment revenue rose 9.9% year on year. Segment  revenue in Japan increased 12.0%, sharply outpacing  the market growth rate. Revenue from Fujitsu Uvance,  a key driver of business growth, rose 84.0% year on  year, as demand related to digital transformation (DX)  and modernization buoyed business scale expansion.  In an effort to improve profitability, we pushed forward  with delivery transformation, with the standardization,  ­automation, and insourcing of system development.  Accordingly, the gross margin ratio improved 2  ­percentage points to 35%. Adjusted operating profit  increased ¥74.2 billion to ¥237.2 billion, and the  adjusted operating profit margin improved 2.9  ­percentage points to 11.1%. As a result, we made  progress on two fronts: expanding our scale of  ­business and improving profitability. 	 Meanwhile, in Hardware Solutions, revenue from  network products fell from the high demand levels of  the previous fiscal year.

We made substantial headway in addressing  medium- and long-term business issues. In Regions  (International), we decided to carve out low-profit  businesses and restructure the European corporate  structure in order to transform the portfolio. In  Hardware Solutions, we established Fsas Technologies  Inc. to boost business efficiency by integrating  ­development, manufacturing, sales, and maintenance  functions in the domestic servers and storage system  business. Furthermore, in Device Solutions we  ­concluded an agreement for the transfer of shares in  SHINKO ELECTRIC INDUSTRIES CO., LTD. 	 The impact on profits of addressing these  medium- to long-term issues was more than ¥120.0  billion in one-time losses affecting operating profit.  However, the restructuring of the European corporate  system and other factors resulted in a tax benefit of  more than ¥140.0 billion, for a net positive effect. 	 We believe our share price and price book-value  ratio (PBR) at the end of fiscal 2024 will reflect the  growth of the Service Solutions segment and the  market’s evaluation of our efforts to address medium-  to long-term business challenges. Efforts to accelerate growth in fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2024 is the midpoint of our 2023–2025  Medium-Term Management Plan (medium-term plan),  and is thus an important year in connection with our  goals. We anticipate that adjusted operating profit  from Service Solutions will increase 18% year on year  due to revenue growth and steady profitability  improvements, backed by robust growth in Fujitsu  Uvance and the modernization business. In particular,  from the viewpoint of improving profitability, in addi­ tion to the ongoing delivery transformation we expect  a contribution from expanded offerings in the highly  profitable Vertical areas of Fujitsu Uvance. 	 We will continue investing to accelerate business  growth over the medium to long term. In fiscal 2024,  our focus will be on investing, particularly in relation  to the acquisition of consulting capabilities and the  evolution of Key Technologies such as AI. These are  essential areas for providing customers with services  that help solve social issues and create value through  Fujitsu Uvance and modernization. By stepping up  these initiatives, we aim to achieve the medium-term  plan and position ourselves for ­sustainable growth in  2030 and beyond.

During the three years of the medium-term plan,  fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2025, we are targeting base  cash flow* of ¥1.3 trillion. Base cash flow, which is  the source of funds for capital allocation, includes  cash generated through asset recycling. Our capital  allocation plan remains unchanged. This plan calls for  us to allocate around ¥700.0 billion in cash flow  toward business growth investments and approxi­ mately ¥600.0 billion to shareholder returns, ensuring  sustainable growth in corporate value. 	 Key areas of focus for our business growth invest­ ments are expanding Fujitsu Uvance offerings,  enhancing consulting capabilities, conducting R&D  into advanced technologies, and strengthening man­ agement foundations such as the OneFujitsu Program.  Naturally, we thoroughly monitor return on  investment (ROI). We seek to increase ROI by empha­ sizing contribution to growth from a medium- to  long-term perspective, as well as short-term capital  recovery. 	 We view shareholder returns as total returns from  the combination of stable dividends and flexible  share buybacks. In fiscal 2023, we awarded annual  dividends of ¥26 per share, paying a total of ¥48.4  billion in dividends. This was our eighth consecutive  year of dividend increases. We also acquired ¥103.1  billion in treasury stock. Including this share buyback,  in fiscal 2023 total shareholder returns came to  ¥151.5 billion, bringing the total return ratio to 60%.  We expect to continue increasing dividends for the  ninth consecutive year in fiscal 2024, awarding annual  dividends of ¥28 per share. We also plan to buy back  shares worth ¥180.0 billion, boosting total returns for  the year to ¥230.0 billion. Our plan to achieve share­ holder returns of ¥600.0 billion over three years  remains unchanged. * Cash flows including free cash flow before growth investments and lease expenses Ensuring we achieve our targets under the  medium-term plan In fiscal 2023, we saw steady results in the growth of  the Service Solutions segment and made progress in  addressing medium- and long-term business issues to  create a starting point for growth. We will accelerate  this growth in fiscal 2024, while at the same time  firmly promoting initiatives that will lead to sustainable  growth in fiscal 2025 and beyond. 	 We will continue working to craft solutions and  technologies based on our deep insight into chang­ ing social issues and strive to meet the financial tar­ gets set forth in our medium-term plan in order to  realize our vision for 2030.

Profit attributable to owners of the parent +¥39.2 billion  UP Profit attributable to owners of the parent rose to a record high, primarily owing to  the impact of lower tax expenses after recognizing deferred tax assets in connec­ tion with the restructuring of our corporate structure in Europe, despite the book­ ing of one-off losses arising from the execution of structural reforms centered on  business in Regions (International). Free cash flow -¥25.5 billion  DOWN Although cash flows from operating activities increased from the previous fiscal  year due to progress made on reducing inventories and collecting accounts receiv­ able, cash flows from investing activities increased, mainly from the acquisition of  GK Software. As a result, free cash flow declined. Adjusted net profit attributable to owners of the parent per share  (EPS) +¥20.5  UP EPS increased as a result of not only core business profit growth, but share  buybacks and other efforts aimed at improving capital efficiency. Equity attributable to owners of the parent ratio  +1.3 percentage points  UP Retained earnings increased mainly due to the recording of profit for the year  attributable to owners of the parent. Also, the Company repurchased ¥103.1 billion  of shares as a shareholder return measure. As a result, the equity attributable to  owners of the parent ratio increased from the end of the previous fiscal year. Adjusted operating profit -¥37.1 billion  DOWN Although profit in the Service Solutions segment was boosted by higher revenue  and margin improvements in domestic services, among other factors, adjusted  operating profit declined overall, reflecting the impact of lower profits in network  products in the Hardware Solutions segment and the Device Solutions segment.

Whereas the existing IT market, such as  traditional core systems, is expected to  gradually shrink, investment in modern­ ization and cloud migration should  steadily expand going forward. Also,  investment in digitalization such as AI  and other technologies, as well as data  analysis and utilization, is expected to  expand in the future, driven by demand  for growth and development from soci­ ety and corporations, as well as the  need to keep pace with changes in  social systems and industrial structures. Revenue came to ¥2,137.5 billion (up 7.7% year on year) on the back  of strong growth in DX and modernization business primarily in Japan.  By tapping strong demand for sustainability transformation projects  and the like, Fujitsu Uvance revenue and orders increased sharply to  ¥367.9 billion (up 84% year on year) and ¥449.3 billion (up 80%),  respectively. The weighting of revenue from Fujitsu Uvance as a per­ centage of overall Service Solutions revenue rose from 10% last fiscal  year to 17%. 	 Adjusted operating profit came to ¥237.2 billion (up ¥74.2 billion  year on year). Alongside the boost from higher revenue, profitability  improved on the strength of offshoring through our Global Delivery  Centers as well as steady improvements in the standardization,  automation, and insourcing of development processes. These profit  drivers outweighed increased investments in the development of  Fujitsu Uvance offerings, the nurturing of highly skilled human  resources, reskilling, and security enhancements, and as a result,  adjusted operating profit substantially increased. We continue to transform the business  portfolio with a view to improving prof­ itability in Regions (International). (1) By  carving out the private cloud business in  Germany, we stepped up our focus on  business domains centered on Fujitsu  Uvance. (2) By withdrawing from low  profitability regions and downsizing cor­ porate functions in Europe, we will con­ centrate operations and improve  business efficiency, and as a result, we  expect to reap the benefits of cost  improvements from fiscal 2024 onward.  (3) By streamlining and reorganizing our  corporate structure in Europe and  establishing clear business management  systems for service and hardware busi­ nesses, we aim to improve management  efficiency and strengthen governance. We anticipate revenue growth centered  on Fujitsu Uvance and will look to  steadily capture brisk demand for mod­ ernization and expand the consulting  business. Also, in overseas markets, we  will endeavor to improve profitability by  steadily realizing improvements in mar­ gins with transformation initiatives.  While continuing to accelerate our hith­ erto measures for improving productivity,  we will also aim to ramp up investments  for the future with a view to enhancing  consulting capabilities and developing  Fujitsu Uvance offerings. By implement­ ing the above-mentioned initiatives, we  forecast growth in both revenue and  adjusted operating profit in the Service  Solutions segment, to ¥2,230.0 billion  and ¥280.0 billion, respectively.

The network products market overall is shrink­ ing due to rapid contraction of the LTE market,  despite ongoing investments in 5G in the mobile  systems space. The optical transmission market is  also expected to contract with the peaking of  5G construction and a deteriorating market  ­environment, among other factors. Revenue came to ¥1,108 billion (down 2.2% year  on year). Revenue in the system products business  increased 7.2% year on year mainly due to the  impact of foreign exchange effects. In contrast,  revenue in the network products business declined  32.2% owing to a continued downturn in demand  for mobile systems and photonics from the previ­ ous fiscal year. We are ramping up investments in  developments for the next cycle in order to  achieve faster and higher capacity networks that  use less energy. Adjusted operating profit was  ¥83.6 billion (down ¥28.9 billion year on year),  ­primarily reflecting the impact of lower revenue. With the objective of strengthening the foundation  of the hardware business, particularly in the areas of  servers and storage systems, on April 1, 2024 we  launched Fsas Technologies Inc. By establishing an  integrated system from development, manufactur­ ing and sales to maintenance, we will pursue speedy  decision-making and thorough efficiency in  management. 	 Combining our extensive lineup of offerings  with high-value-added hardware solutions that can  quickly ascertain customer needs, the entire Group  will look to provide total solutions that support the  transformation of society and corporations. We forecast lower revenue in the  system products business, partly  reflecting the downturn in large- scale deals for servers/storage  systems and machine upgrades to  support Japan’s new bank notes. We  expect demand for network  ­products in fiscal 2024 will be on  par with fiscal 2023. Owing to the  above, for the Hardware Solutions  segment, we forecast revenue and  adjusted operating profit of  ¥1,030.0 billion and ¥70.0 billion,  respectively.

Going forward, the market as a  whole is expected to expand, reflecting  forecasts for replacement demand for  Windows 10 support ending in 2025 and an  anticipated recovery in demand in the  domestic Japanese market, buoyed mainly  by PC replacement demand for the GIGA  School Program in the education market. The delayed recovery of the PC, server, and  smartphone markets, as well as concerns  over a prolonged adjustment in semicon­ ductor inventories, will likely persist going  forward, but there are also expectations for  a recovery in chip demand fueled mainly by  the proliferation of AI services. Also, with  the increasing importance of semiconduc­ tors as a key technology supporting  advancements in DX and green transforma­ tion for a carbon-neutral society, global  competition in this sector is expected to  further intensify. Revenue was ¥273.3 billion (down 4.4% year on  year). As a result of efforts to cut costs and imple­ ment cost pass-alongs in response to the higher  prices of components, including the impact of for­ eign exchange effects, adjusted operating profit  surged to ¥24.2 billion (up ¥15.5 billion, or 178.4%,  year on year). Also, in April 2024 we withdrew from  the client computing devices (CCD) business in  Europe due to the intensely competitive environ­ ment, in which we struggled to turn a profit. Owing  to this withdrawal, we forecast a decline in revenue  in fiscal 2024. Revenue was ¥286.3 billion (down 25.2% year on  year). Demand for semiconductor packages was  brisk through the first half of fiscal 2022, but slowed  significantly in the second half and remained weak  throughout fiscal 2023. As a result, coupled with a  downturn in plant operations owing to reduced  volume, adjusted operating profit came to ¥18.3  billion (down ¥59.0 billion year on year). Also, in  December 2023 the Group announced the conclu­ sion of an agreement regarding the transfer of the  shares of SHINKO ELECTRIC INDUSTRIES CO., LTD.  As a result of the share transfer, SHINKO ELECTRIC  INDUSTRIES is scheduled to be removed from the  Group’s consolidated subsidiaries.

Launch of Uvance Wayfinders Under the 2023–2025 Medium-Term Management  Plan, the Group has prioritized the expansion of  consulting services as part of its customer success/ regional strategy. This focus is driven by our vision  of being a technology company that realizes a net  positive for society by 2030. Achieving this vision  requires a consulting approach that can compre­ hensively understand and address issues. In the  medium-term plan, the Group has announced its  target of expanding to approximately 10,000  consulting personnel by the end of fiscal 2025. In  February 2024, the Group launched a new brand for  the consulting business called Uvance Wayfinders,  conveying to the market our commitment to  expand the consulting business and establish a  robust consulting structure.  	 We are working to expand the consulting business  for the following three reasons. First, as industrial struc­ tures evolve and issues become more complex and  diverse, we aim to contribute to solving issues in cross- industry domains, where knowledge from various sec­ tors and fields is essential. Second, as technologies  such as AI and quantum computing have a growing  impact on industries, we intend to create innovative  business models with customers, leveraging our  strengths as a technology company engaged in R&D.  Third, we aim to offer higher value-added services by  combining the Group’s accumulated knowledge and  technological capabilities with consulting services.

Fujitsu’s support for  Taisei’s DX initiative was kicked off with consulting services  which culminated in the building of a data asset utilization  platform called Taisei-Data as a Service (Taisei-DaaS) in  2021 and its operational launch in 2022.  	 The first step supported by our consultants was the  development of an implementation plan for Taisei-DaaS.  This included identifying needs in multiple departments  where utilization was anticipated, clarifying overall IT envi­ ronment requirements, establishing rules and processes  aimed at promoting collaboration between developers and  operators, and detailing the steps necessary to make this  happen. This process helped to foster a shared ownership  among stakeholders.  	 In fiscal 2021, we kicked off the Taisei-DaaS launch proj­ ect, which included the data engineering team. Under the  management of the consultants, the platform was built  through a repeated process of short development and test­ ing cycles, resulting in its operational launch in early fiscal  2022. Even after the launch, the consultants remained  involved in advocating for data utilization, such as data  democratization, and continued to support Taisei’s DX  efforts aimed at enhancing corporate value. Consulting-driven business model transformation Transforming business models is one of the objec­ tives in our launch of Uvance Wayfinders. Uvance  Wayfinders goes beyond traditional business consult­ ing and technology implementation by leveraging  the Group’s own cutting-edge technologies, such as  AI, to provide technology-driven consulting services  for conceptualizing the transformation of business  models. Fujitsu intends to lead the formation of  cross-industry ecosystems and the co-creation of  new digital services, ultimately contributing to solu­ tions for societal issues and customers’ management  and business issues, including the realization of more  resilient social systems and a circular economy.  	 By approaching issues through consulting  grounded in technology and execution capabilities,  the Group aims to enhance the profitability of its  consulting business. Additionally, we seek to increase  the value we provides and broaden revenue streams  by leading the transformation of business through  the effective introduction of Fujitsu Uvance and  ­modernization solutions tailored to specific issues. Business plan In fiscal 2023, the Fujitsu Group’s consulting business  generated approximately ¥30.0 billion in revenue,  with a gross margin of around 30%. By fiscal 2025, the  Group aims to increase revenue in the consulting  business to approximately ¥180.0 billion and improve  the gross margin to 50%. To achieve this, we plan to  expand the number of consulting personnel to about  10,000 people by the end of fiscal 2025, sourcing  talent both internally and externally. Furthermore, the  Group aims to significantly scale up Fujitsu Uvance  and the modernization and digital service businesses,  driving this growth through consulting services, from  a revenue base of approximately ¥10.0 billion in fiscal  2023 to ¥280.0 billion in fiscal 2025. The Group aims  to enhance profitability by increasing the proportion  of consulting that leads to projects for high-margin  businesses centered on Fujitsu Uvance’s Vertical areas,  and shifting from a labor-intensive business model to  collaborative and recurring business models. Strengthening our consulting capabilities To achieve our business plan, we are expanding our  headcount in the consulting business. As of the end  of fiscal 2023, the Group had approximately 2,000  consultants, comprising around 600 business consul­ tants and 1,400 technology consultants. By the end of  fiscal 2025, we plan to increase this to 3,000 business  consultants and 7,000 technology consultants. To  support this expansion, the Group will invest approxi­ mately ¥20.0 billion in fiscal 2024, linking its consulting  business strategy and human resource ­strategy. This  investment will focus on reskilling employees and  stepping up recruitment efforts both in Japan and  abroad in order to acquire the necessary talent.  	 Of the planned 10,000 consultants, about 7,000  consultants are expected to be reskilled employees.  We are targeting knowledgeable and experienced  system engineers (SEs) and business producers (BPs)  Fujitsu Group overview   and management policy Management strategy Financial strategy and   business overview Progress and outlook in   focus areas Reinforcing management   capital Sustainability   management Corporate governance Data section 35 Fujitsu Integrated Report 2024 Strengthening of consulting  capabilities Growth scenario for Fujitsu Uvance Fujitsu Uvance’s key offerings Technology leadership underpinned  by a pioneering AI strategy Growth potential of modernization Improving productivity   by transforming delivery  ===== PAGE 37 ===== Strengthening of consulting capabilities for reskilling, not only through training programs but  also through practical experience via on-the-job  training (OJT) to enhance their consulting capabilities.  Additionally, we have set up a certification system to  assess whether individuals are capable of delivering  value to clients, ensuring the quality of our  ­consulting services. 	 In our recruitment activities,  amid intense competition for  experienced consultants, we  emphasize several key high­ lights for working at the Fujitsu  Group: the opportunity to  engage in transformative proj­ ects utilizing advanced technol­ ogies; the chance to quickly gain experience in  ­solving complex, intertwined societal issues; and our  leading position in the domestic IT services market,  which opens up access to decision-makers across a  wide range of customers. 	 Furthermore, through our Center of Excellence (CoE)  for consulting, we are building systems to share  ­consulting knowledge globally, which supports the  professional development of our talent and continu­ ously enhances the quality of Uvance Wayfinders.  Our current position and outlook The Group has already instituted the Uvance  Wayfinders certification system and introduced a  human resource system for consultants. Our first  group of certified consultants began to make their  mark in the market as of January 2024. The reskilling  program also began in December 2023, with about  100 employees each month learning and honing their  consulting skills in real-world scenarios. Our certified  consultants have started to develop markets, steadily  expanding our pipeline of projects. 	 While the market for talent acquisition remains  intensely competitive, presenting challenges in  recruiting new hires, as of August 2024 Fujitsu has  increased its consulting workforce to 2,500 person­ nel, achieved ¥8.7 billion in consulting business reve­ nue, and generated ¥6.0 billion in revenue from  Fujitsu Uvance and related businesses through  ­consulting leads. The size of our consulting workforce  is now comparable to that of major consulting firms  in Japan, and we are seeing positive signs of growth.  	 Looking ahead, we anticipate tough competition  for recruiting talent as companies seek to hire more  types of consultants, such as cloud service providers  expanding their recruitment of cloud consultants and  consulting firms increasing their focus on hiring gen­ erative AI consultants. Nevertheless, with increased  fluidity in the job market, as evidenced by the recent  layoffs announced by firms both domestically and  internationally, we believe there are ample opportu­ nities to recruit sizeable numbers of consultants. 	 From a business perspective, competition in  ­technology-driven consulting is becoming increas­ ingly tough, especially as major strategy consulting  firms strengthen their presence in the digital field.  However, Fujitsu is well-positioned to capitalize on  these opportunities and drive business expansion by  leveraging its ability to identify issues through a  cross-industry approach linked with Fujitsu Uvance,  and pursuing M&As overseas under a globally  ­coordinated strategy led by headquarters. 	 In fiscal 2024, the Group will establish a consulting  business framework in each region. In North America,  we will focus on recruiting partner-level professionals  and teams that will shape the core of its consulting  business, and launch several consulting practices, such  as Customer Experience (CX). In the Asia Pacific region,  we will expand the certifications of consultants, partic­ ularly those from companies acquired through M&As,  and globally utilize their expertise in areas like security  consulting. In Europe, we will actively pursue M&As to  complement our consulting capabilities and accelerate  the development of Fujitsu Uvance. In Japan, we will  enhance our consulting approach for key clients, which  should strengthen our client portfolio. The CoE for  consulting, which oversees all regions, will develop  consulting service offerings, consolidate knowledge,  and provide training.  	 In fiscal 2025, we aim to establish competitive  advantages by expanding this system globally and  through consulting grounded in technology and  ­execution capabilities. Looking forward to 2030, as  technology increasingly reshapes the nature of  ­business, Uvance Wayfinders, with technology in their  DNA, will lead us to a new era in consulting.

Significance of Fujitsu Uvance Fujitsu Uvance was inspired by societal issues such as  carbon neutrality that can only be resolved by tran­ scending industry boundaries, and aims to provide  cross-industry offerings that help customers imple­ ment both business and social solutions. The  medium-term plan sets a revenue target of ¥700.0  billion for Fujitsu Uvance by fiscal 2025. 	 Fujitsu Uvance also represents the transformation  to a new business model. To provide Fujitsu Uvance,  we need to renew the Fujitsu Group, which has long  been optimized for the system integration (SI)  ­business. This renewal needs to happen at all  levels—in our organizational culture, the value we  provide to customers, business processes, and per­ sonnel evaluation and compensation systems. We  also need to foster substantial behavioral changes on  the part of each employee. Fujitsu Uvance’s competitive advantages The first advantage of Fujitsu Uvance lies in the value of  the Group’s proprietary offerings to its customers. Fujitsu  Uvance provides wide-ranging values including supply  chain optimization across industries such as manufactur­ ing, logistics, and retail; automation and improvement of  operations using AI; and visualization and advanced  decision-making support by integrating various business  applications and data throughout the enterprise. These  values help our customers achieve both economic  streamlining and sustainability, which in turn help them  transform their management and business. Difference between SI and offerings SI involves tailoring development to meet the individual  service requirements of each customer. In contrast to this  one-to-one approach, Fujitsu Uvance involves one-to-many  (1:N) offerings. Under this model, services developed  through hypothesis testing with multiple customers are  deployed to other customers via the cloud. Within a given  framework, we customize our offerings to meet customers’  needs, and continuously expand and improve the function­ ality of our offerings based on customer feedback. This  allows our customers to implement best practices in a rela­ tively short period of time in the form of offerings, even for  issues for which requirement definition is difficult. For the  Fujitsu Group, 1:N deployment increases productivity and  enables sales growth independent of delivery resources.  The relationship with the customer is also different. In SI, an  IT system is developed based on the definition of require­ ments. We receive compensation when the system is deliv­ ered, and the transaction is then complete. With Fujitsu  Uvance offerings, revenue recurs and is recorded based on  when and how much the offerings are used.

Fujitsu Uvance’s growth is directly linked  to the promotion of Materiality. Fujitsu Uvance can be  thought of as a business model that delivers offerings  that contribute to solving global environmental issues  (Planet), developing a digital society (Prosperity), and  improving people’s well-being (People). 	 When we develop and provide offerings, we  ensure linkage with our Materiality by clearly defining  the value of the offerings based on societal issues to  be solved. In our proposals to customers and presen­ tations to the public, we make a thorough effort to  build scenarios around such issues. In addition, Fujitsu  Uvance continuously works to foster understanding  among employees by including information in train­ ing programs for business producers (BPs) in front  office sales division, who are responsible for making  proposals to Fujitsu Uvance customers, about how to  propose offerings systematized from the viewpoint of  Materiality. In this way, we are continuously working  to cultivate employees’ understanding. Progress on operating performance In fiscal 2023, which marked our full-fledged launch  of offerings in Vertical areas, revenue from Fujitsu  Uvance surged 84% year on year to ¥367.9 billion,  rising as a percentage of revenue in the core Service  Solutions segment from around 10% in the previous  fiscal year to approximately 17%. Driven by expanded  offerings, notably in the area of Sustainable  Manufacturing, we obtained large-scale business  deals that caused revenue from Vertical areas to soar  ¥101.3 billion year on year. Meanwhile, Horizontal  areas also expanded steadily, as our ability to  respond to strong demand led to the acquisition of  large business deals in Business Applications both in  Japan and overseas, mainly from the manufacturing  industry. 	 The second advantage is time. Fujitsu Uvance’s  approach allows customers to be flexible in expand­ ing the scope of implementation and to confirm  effectiveness in short cycles, rather than a process  that takes years to go from requirement definitions to  development, implementation, and measurement of  effectiveness. By taking a consulting approach  toward organizing issues and requirements, utilizing  standardized offerings, and leveraging our experi­ ence in implementing them, we can deliver tangible  results to our customers quickly, getting offerings up  and running in as little as a several weeks. 	 Third is our ability to implement offerings based on  a deep awareness of customers’ IT assets. We have  years of accumulated knowledge of customer opera­ tions. We leverage this understanding to propose the  best ways of integrating standardized Fujitsu Uvance  offerings into their existing systems. The capabilities  we have honed through our SI business lead to a high  success rate with Fujitsu Uvance and increase the  speed of implementation of our offerings. 	 Finally, consulting services represent a competitive  advantage that we will strengthen further going for­ ward. We are focused on reinforcing our consulting  capabilities to provide solutions in areas such as sus­ tainability transformation (SX), where customers may  have difficulty resolving issues on their own. Through  consulting, we maintain a dialogue with our customers  even after offerings have been deployed to provide  enhancements and ensure ongoing customer success. 46 	 Number of offerings in fiscal 2023 Growth scenario for Fujitsu Uvance Fujitsu Group overview   and management policy Management strategy Financial strategy and   business overview Progress and outlook in   focus areas Reinforcing management   capital Sustainability   management Corporate governance Data section 38 Fujitsu Integrated Report 2024 Strengthening of consulting  capabilities Growth scenario for Fujitsu Uvance Fujitsu Uvance’s key offerings Technology leadership underpinned  by a pioneering AI strategy Growth potential of modernization Improving productivity   by transforming delivery  ===== PAGE 40 ===== 200.0 200.0 185.0 185.0 15.0 15.0 251.5 251.5 116.3 116.3 367.9 367.9 270.0 270.0 180.0 180.0 450.0 450.0 300.0 300.0 400.0 400.0 700.0 700.0 (Billions of yen) aiming to reach ¥700.0 billion in revenue, our target  under the medium-term plan. Global rollout To expand Fujitsu Uvance in overseas markets, where  the Group has fewer resources than in Japan, a dedi­ cated organization was established in Regions  (International) in fiscal 2023. In collaboration with  Groupwide measures to reinforce consulting, we built a  structure capable of proposing and receiving orders for  offerings in Vertical areas, in particular. In addition, by  establishing a delivery model for each offering and  thoroughly standardizing the development and imple­ mentation process, we are developing a system to  deploy Fujitsu Uvance globally. 	 While demand in Regions (International) is strong  and sales are growing steadily, in Horizontal areas  price competition is fierce and improving profitability  is an issue. Working region by region, we intend to  migrate from overly optimized services to common  global offerings with high added value. At the same  time, we will work to heighten competitiveness and  improve profitability. Specifically, we will focus on  security, a growth area, and expand sales of Fujitsu  Data Intelligence PaaS (DI PaaS), an operations  platform that leverages data and AI. 	 In addition, we will take various measures to  ­reinforce our structure for SAP, Salesforce, and  ServiceNow (3S), which enjoy strong demand. These  efforts will include the global development of high- value-added services such as consulting and M&As.  For example, with ServiceNow, we combine our  Customer Advisory and Support Excellence advisory  service, which supports continuous improvement  from platform utilization to strategic planning, with  ServiceNow's ServiceNow Impact to maximize the  value of offerings on the ServiceNow platform for  our customers. Offerings in Vertical areas and the Digital Shifts field  will drive future growth. We will continue to  strengthen our offerings in fiscal 2024, particularly in  areas such as supply chain management, AI, and data  utilization, where we believe the market will increase.  While we expect offerings to expand to some extend  in fiscal 2024, from that point we plan to focus simul­ taneously on increasing the number of users of exist­ ing offerings and the value of those offerings. In  fiscal 2025, we will continue to focus on achieving  growth by augmenting sales and profit per offering,  Growth scenario for Fujitsu Uvance Percentage of   total revenue  (Fujitsu Uvance /   Service Solutions) Revenue increase Status of Fujitsu Uvance 2024 (Plan) 2025 (Plan) (Fiscal years) 2022 2023 Fujitsu Uvance Vertical Horizontal 10% ¥200.0  billion 17% ¥367.9  billion Up 84% Up 22% 20% ¥450.0  billion 30% ¥700.0  billion Period of medium-term plan Up 56% Fujitsu Group overview   and management policy Management strategy Financial strategy and   business overview Progress and outlook in   focus areas Reinforcing management   capital Sustainability   management Corporate governance Data section 39 Fujitsu Integrated Report 2024 Strengthening of consulting  capabilities Growth scenario for Fujitsu Uvance Fujitsu Uvance’s key offerings Technology leadership underpinned  by a pioneering AI strategy Growth potential of modernization Improving productivity   by transforming delivery  ===== PAGE 41 ===== services market by proactively adopting the latest  technologies and global best practices, and to pro­ vide customers with advanced, global-standard ser­ vices and solutions to drive sustainable growth. In  addition to the above-mentioned partnership with  ServiceNow, in fiscal 2023 we formed a global part­ nership with Palantir Technologies Inc. to incorporate  and offer AI and data integration capabilities as the  offering’s data foundation. As Japan’s first premium  supplier for SAP, we have a wide range of partner­ ships in place. These include the development and  provision of a comprehensive cloud ERP solution  called RISE with SAP, a premium supplier option via  Higher with Fujitsu, which we provide as an offering  in Horizontal areas. 	 The Group’s focus in these strategic partnerships is  to add more value by leveraging its unique intellec­ tual property (IP). By combining Fujitsu’s proprietary  technologies and services with the platforms and  solutions offered in the cloud by global players such  as 3S, Microsoft, and AWS, we provide offerings that  address our customers’ problems and create added  value unique to the Group. We have developed a  number of in-house technologies to leverage Fujitsu  Kozuchi, our suite of AI services. For instance, Fujitsu  AutoML automatically creates predictive models from  data, and Fujitsu Kozuchi for Vision recognizes human  behavior and facial expressions from video images. AI  Trust is designed to address the hallucinations that  can occur with generative AI and the hostile attacks  that can trick AI. Even as we work to expand Fujitsu  Uvance’s offerings globally, we will continue to con­ centrate on rapidly expanding our scale by leveraging  the extensive knowledge of our global partners. Value-based pricing In the SI business, conventional practice is to esti­ mate pricing based on the total amount of labor and  other costs required for system development. In con­ trast, many of Fujitsu Uvance’s offerings use a pricing  model centered on the monetary value provided to  customers, or a pay-as-you-go model based on the  quantity of computing resources used. 	 The components of monetary value can be broadly  divided into cost savings realized by the customer and  the benefits the customer derives from increased sales.  In the planning stage of an offering, we ­hypothesize its  effect in order to calculate the monetary value to the  customer. We then repeatedly ­confirm the veracity of  the hypothesis, thereby ­improving the accuracy of  the pricing. 	 We began planning and developing products with  actual value-based pricing in the second half of fiscal  2023. Of the approximately 30 offerings in Vertical  areas we have launched since then, two-thirds use  value-based pricing. We plan to continue making  value-based pricing more adaptable, focusing on  newly developed offerings, and reflect in our pricing  the greater value we provide to customers through  functional enhancements. Strategic partnerships In recent years, the Group has accelerated its strate­ gic alliances with global solution and application  vendors, led by 3S. The strategic idea behind this  focus is to respond quickly to changes in the IT  Examples of added value created through  strategic partnerships In May 2024, the Fujitsu Group and ServiceNow announced  a strategic partnership to deliver innovative cross-industry  offerings. Through this partnership, we plan to combine  ServiceNow’s digital business platform with Fujitsu Uvance  by utilizing the Fujitsu Group’s extensive expertise in a vari­ ety of industries. For example, combining our AI service  suite Fujitsu Kozuchi with ServiceNow’s Now Assist will  enable us to automatically generate bodies of Q&A by pre­ dicting problems based on an analysis of response trends  and ascertaining operator responses. We expect this offer­ ing to revolutionize helpdesk operations and significantly  improve efficiency in the service industry. 	 In this way, the Group will go beyond the development  of offerings based on ServiceNow’s knowledge. Instead, to  increase the value provided to customers we will share our  product development road map and ServiceNow will dis­ patch dedicated Fujitsu personnel to develop offerings. In  addition to collaborating in sales, marketing implementa­ tion, and delivery, we are introducing ServiceNow’s training  program to all Fujitsu Group employees, aiming to enhance  added value through human resource development.

We are focusing our  resources on developing five Key Technologies: AI,  which has been under development since the 1980s,  complemented by computing, data & security, net­ working, and converging technologies that combine  digital technologies and the humanities. 	 Generative AI is rapidly expanding in business  applications, and its growth has been explosive. In  response to this trend, we announced the Fujitsu AI  Strategy in February 2024, reinforcing our objective  to become a top global player in the drive to get  enterprises to adopt generative AI, by focusing on AI  models tailored to enterprise needs. Specifically, we  are enhancing the value we provide to customers by  offering the cloud-based AI platform Fujitsu Kozuchi  as a part of Fujitsu Uvance. 	 To carve out a leading position in the fiercely com­ petitive new technology arena, we believe that speed  and agility are key—delivering developed technolo­ gies to customers quickly, gathering feedback and  turning this into fast-track improvements. Featuring  our cutting-edge AI technology, Fujitsu Kozuchi is a  set of “ready-to-use” AI solutions that embodies this  approach. Since its release in April 2023, we have  conducted approximately 500 proposal activities and  proof-of-concept demonstrations for customers.  Based on our accumulated knowledge and insights  from these activities, we have continuously evolved  the platform to meet customer needs, culminating in  its commercial launch in February 2024. We continue  to expand our lineup of offerings and accelerate its  integration into Fujitsu Uvance. Vivek Mahajan Corporate Executive Officer, Corporate Vice President, CTO, CPO, in charge of System Platform * Technology * Portfolio Fujitsu aims to become a top global player in  driving the adoption of generative AI in  ­enterprises. It is realizing this ambition by  ­accelerating the comprehensive ­implementation  of AI into Fujitsu Uvance offerings. Evolution tailored to enterprise needs The Generative AI Framework for Enterprises, a new  addition to the Fujitsu Kozuchi lineup, launched in July  2024. This framework combines and links three of our  proprietary technologies: Knowledge Graph*1  Extended RAG,*2 Generative AI Amalgamation  Technology, and Generative AI Audit Technology. This  approach generates specialized generative AI auto­ matically that flexibly responds to corporate needs,  enables the resolution of issues associated with the  handling of large amounts of corporate data, and  provides output that can be explained in compliance  with laws, regulations and corporate rules. 	 Fujitsu’s aim is to realize a sustainable society  where customers can safely use AI, and to this end,  we are also advancing R&D and conducting proof-of- concept demonstrations that enhance AI trustworthi­ ness. One example is our proprietary AI trust  technology, Fujitsu AI Ethics for Fairness, which veri­ fies and improves the impartiality of AI models. This  technology is integrated into the AI core engine of  Fujitsu Kozuchi, enabling people who are not special­ ists in AI ethics and do not have programming skills  to verify and improve AI fairness. 	 In May 2024, Fujitsu released Fugaku-LLM, a large- scale language model (LLM) trained on the super­ computer Fugaku. We are encouraging its use in  innovative scientific research and business applica­ tions. Additionally, in July 2024, Fujitsu announced a  strategic partnership with Canadian startup Cohere  Inc., which has a proven track record in enterprise AI,  to provide generative AI solutions for companies.

Modernization entails the upgrading of so-called  “legacy” systems, which were developed with older  technology and optimized for individual companies or  operations, to the latest technologies. Modernization  enhances the scalability, innovativeness, and cost effi­ ciency of IT assets, facilitating DX that enables data- driven management, and the success of SX. 	 At the Fujitsu Group, we view modernization as  encompassing four steps: 1) the visualization of assets,  including business operations, applications, processes,  infrastructure, and data; 2) the formulation of a grand  design; 3) the streamlining of the overall information  system; and 4) modernization, which includes migrat­ ing systems to an optimal IT infrastructure and prepar­ ing for further DX realization. Fujitsu’s competitive advantages Fujitsu’s competitive edge lies in its technical expertise  accumulated through the development and building of  large-scale core information systems, its knowledge of  mainframes developed and manufactured in-house,  and the depth of its engineering workforce that applies  these technologies and knowledge in the provision of  comprehensive services. Additionally, our extensive  experience and track record in modernization, DX, and  SX, including our in-house implementations, have  afforded us excellent project proposal and execution  capabilities in the DX and SX fields. Furthermore, Fujitsu  boasts the largest customer base in Japan, including  customers using Fujitsu-made mainframes. 	 The domestic modernization market is worth approx­ imately ¥2.72 trillion in fiscal 2024. Fujitsu forecasts  that this market will expand at a compound annual  growth rate (CAGR) of 14.5% through 2026 and main­ tain an annual scale of ¥3 trillion through 2030. Fujitsu  intends to establish a leading position in this market. Megumi Shimazu Corporate Executive Officer, Corporate Vice President, COO (in charge of Service Delivery) By steadily tapping into demand for  modernization and expanding  our delivery capabilities, we contribute to  the success of our customers’ DX, and  translate this into growth. Modernization Knowledge Center In 2022, Fujitsu established the Modernization  Knowledge Center as a CoE to consolidate superior  insights, best practices, and talent related to modern­ ization. As of August 2024, approximately 150 engi­ neers are working to standardize services based on  practical and experiential knowledge of modernization.  They also provide support for BPs and SEs responsible  for customer engagements, and verify, prepare, and  deliver tools and services for both Fujitsu and strategic  partners. 	 At the Modernization Knowledge Center, we are also  expanding our team of specialist engineers known as  Modernization Meisters who work closely on projects.  By re-hiring and training engineers who are approach­ ing mandatory retirement, we plan to grow the team  of Modernization Meisters from 40 members as of June  2024 to 100 by April 2025 and to 500 by fiscal 2026.  These Modernization Meisters provide advanced  expertise based on their much-needed skills and expe­ rience, collaborating with our extensive delivery teams  to meet increasing demand for modernization.

This includes  not only traditional SI projects, but also the delivery  of Fujitsu Uvance offerings. 	 Until a few years ago, Fujitsu’s delivery system was  overly optimized for delivering solutions to individual  customers and organizations, leading to the personaliza­ tion of know-how and a high dependency on the  resources of external development partners to cover  skill and labor shortages within the Group. This created  challenges related to work efficiency and internal  knowledge accumulation and transfer, including for proj­ ect management and technical skills. To address these  challenges, Fujitsu began to accelerate a transformation  of its delivery system in fiscal 2021, kicking off with the  integration of its SI subsidiaries. 	 The goal of this transformation is to increase the  internal production ratio, productivity, quality, and  security by promoting the standardization and auto­ mation of delivery processes, and expanding the use  of Global Delivery Centers (GDCs). We aim to reduce  development based on customer-specific methods  and personalized know-how as much as possible, and  standardize all work processes related to engineering,  development, and testing for service delivery and  offerings. This will allow us to provide higher quality  services more quickly on a global scale. Additionally,  we are pursuing productivity improvements by auto­ mating delivery tasks through the use of generative  AI and other technologies. Strengthening the delivery system Fujitsu’s delivery system, a combination of GDCs and  the Japan Global Gateway (JGG), aims to expand to  40,000 personnel by fiscal 2025, the final year of the  medium-term plan. As of the end of fiscal 2023, the  number of delivery system personnel reached 32,000,  increasing at a pace slightly ahead of plan. In addition  to increasing the number of personnel, we are also  enhancing our delivery capabilities. Having desig­ nated the priority areas of 3S, modernization, cloud,  agile, and project management, we are promoting the  reskilling of GDC personnel in these areas. Fujitsu  aims to increase the ratio of personnel capable of  handling growth areas at GDCs from 10% in fiscal  2022 to 45% by fiscal 2025. What are GDCs and the JGG? GDCs and the JGG are hubs that bring together the special­ ized personnel and expertise that are essential for delivery  operations. Located in countries such as the Philippines, India,  Poland, and Costa Rica, our GDCs work not only for Japan but  also in collaboration with various overseas regions. They  handle a wide range of tasks, including the implementation of  Fujitsu Uvance offerings, the development of software and  applications, operational services, and call center outsourcing. 	 As a group of engineers based in Japan, the JGG leads all  processes and tasks encompassed in project requirements,  from system engineering and development of traditional SI  projects to final delivery. To move away from personalized  work in domestic operations and increase the utilization of  GDCs (i.e., increase the offshoring ratio), the JGG promotes the  standardization of processes and rules related to development  and implementation tasks in collaboration with GDCs, as well  as the education of GDCs on Japanese business practices. 	 GDCs and the JGG are key drivers in enhancing delivery  capabilities and improving the gross profit margin of the  Service Solutions segment. We use the resources provided by  standardization and automation to reskill personnel on higher- level specialized skills, in a continuation of strengthening our  delivery capabilities. At the same time, we are skill mapping  our human resources and use automation technologies to  match necessary personnel to essential projects. This ensures  that human resources are efficiently allocated to projects with  demand for more resources, further enhancing productivity. 40,000 (30,000 / 10,000) 30,000 (23,000 / 7,000) 23,200 (18,500 / 4,700) Established JGG, merged  domestic group companies 2021 2022 2023 2025 Number of  employees (GDCs / JGG) Fujitsu Group overview   and management policy Management strategy Financial strategy and   business overview Progress and outlook in   focus areas Reinforcing management   capital Sustainability   management Corporate governance Data section 45 Fujitsu Integrated Report 2024 Strengthening of consulting  capabilities Growth scenario for Fujitsu Uvance Fujitsu Uvance’s key offerings Technology leadership underpinned  by a pioneering AI strategy Growth potential of modernization Improving productivity   by transforming delivery  ===== PAGE 47 ===== Reinforcing  ­management  capital Management capital, represented by human  resources, intellectual property, and know-how  related to data-driven management, is an essential  input to Fujitsu’s business activities and a source of  value creation. We strive to allocate and utilize these  components of management capital in conjunction  with our business strategies to create value. Also,  we are continually augmenting this capital through  ­strategic investments and effective management,  thereby elevating the sustainability of our management. 46 Fujitsu Integrated Report 2024  ===== PAGE 48 ===== Building a people portfolio that aligns with our  business strategies The mobilization of people is the key to realizing a  business-aligned people portfolio, a resource strategy  in the 2023–2025 Medium-Term Management Plan  (medium-term plan). This is because we need to shift  human resources to business areas that are expected  to grow and become highly profitable in the future— the focus fields described in the medium-term plan’s  business model and portfolio strategy. Based on this  concept, since fiscal 2023 the Fujitsu Group has been  working on the mobilization of people in line with  expanding the focus field, Fujitsu Uvance; the launch  of the Uvance Wayfinders consulting brand; and build­ ing a global organizational structure, promoting inter­ nal job-posting,*1 reskilling and significantly expanding  the recruitment of mid-career personnel. 	 In addition to these initiatives, in fiscal 2024 we  introduced a visualization and monitoring process for  our people portfolio. Specifically, we identify the  number of people required and capabilities that need  to be strengthened along three axes: business, role,  and region. We then analyze gaps in the current  people portfolio to link them to strategic human  resource investments and KPIs. 	 We will also develop data and processes to  enhance our monitoring of the timely and strategic  execution of recruitment, assignment, and training. 	 By sharing with employees our future people port­ folio and capabilities that need to be strengthened,  we encourage internal job-posting and on-demand  learning throughout the Company to enhance mobil­ ity and productivity. *1 A system enabling employees to request transfers to available departments or posi­ tions that meet their career plans Strengthening consulting capabilities From the viewpoint of flexibly promoting measures in  the focus fields indicated in the medium-term plan,  while ensuring alignment with the Groupwide human  resource strategy, it is also important for the HR  department to align with business departments that  are in charge of business strategy. We monitor the  progress of career recruitment, internal job-­posting,  and reskilling, which are the key elements of our busi­ ness strategy. We analyze whether we are above or  below our targets, and if below, we determine where  the problems lie. The business departments and the  HR department then work together to find solutions. 	 Strengthening consulting capabilities is one mea­ sure we are promoting in alignment with business  departments. To achieve our goal of the business  becoming a 10,000-strong organization during the  period of our medium-term plan, we are focused on  reskilling existing personnel and increasing recruitment  of mid-career personnel. To develop consulting per­ sonnel through reskilling, we have introduced a training  and certification process that combines an educational  program leveraging Ridgelinez knowledge with on- the-job training. The Group has a large number of  highly specialized and skilled employees who are  familiar with the latest technologies and customer  operations. We believe that the development of con­ sulting skills by reskilling these employees will enhance  the value we provide to our customers and broaden  employees’ career options, thereby strengthening our  human capital over the medium to long term. 	 The Group recruits from a wide variety of channels,  including through direct scouting and referral-based  We will accelerate HR poli­ cies that promote mobility  of human resources, create a  people portfolio that aligns  with our business strategies,  and strengthen our human  capital over the medium to  long term.

We also  recruit people who have left the Group at some point  but are interested in returning. In fiscal 2023, we con­ ducted a review in Japan of the compensation system  for employees at all levels. As a result, our compensa­ tion level is now competitive with consulting firms.  We will continue to monitor market trends to ensure  we maintain this competitive edge. Challenges for employees as driving force of  transformation Changing employee behaviors is the starting point  for transforming our business model and business  portfolio and taking a unconventional approach  toward providing value to our customers. We have  designed and operate a global personnel evaluation  system, called “Connect,” to foster a mindset that  embraces challenges and the career ownership that  is essential to such behavioral change. We want to  encourage employees to proactively take on chal­ lenges and grow. This is precisely why we evaluate  not only their contribution to the achievement of  short-term performance targets but their efforts to  undertake challenges and help realize Our Purpose  and organizational vision by cultivating new busi­ nesses and transforming the business model. 	 In addition to personnel evaluations, we have intro­ duced a system that encourages employees to take  on new challenges by adjusting their work objectives  and initiatives to respond in a timely manner to the  rapidly changing business environment. Specifically,  the one-on-one meetings conducted at least once a  month between managers and subordinates provide  important opportunities for coaching and feedback. Progress on human resource indicators under the  medium-term plan Of the non-financial targets related to human resources in  the medium-term plan, we are seeing steady improve­ ments in diversity leadership. We have set the ratio of  female managers as a KPI, but essentially we are working  to change our corporate culture. We believe in the neces­ sity of an omnidirectional approach to rolling out initiatives.  In addition to implementing positive actions,*2 we need to  change our mindset by overcoming unconscious bias, pro­ moting inclusive leadership, and reforming workstyles so  individuals have the freedom to work in their own way. 	 Regarding employee engagement, while we saw  some significant improvements in fiscal 2023 at the  organizational level, the Groupwide figure was on par  with fiscal 2022. This demonstrates the difficulty of rais­ ing engagement among the Group’s 120,000-plus  employees. Analysis of data collected in fiscal 2023 sug­ gests that improving people management*3 is key to  enhancing engagement and organizational performance.  Based on results obtained through data analysis, we  intend to persistently work toward augmenting engage­ ment by establishing best practices for each issue and  developing effective actions for each organization. *2 Voluntary and proactive efforts to eliminate disparities between male and female  workers, where such disparities exist, and to achieve substantial equal opportunity *3 Interactive management, in which managers motivate their subordinates through  dialogue and support challenges that lead to their own growth Conveying the significance and results of human  capital management The Fujitsu Group is a leader in digital transformation  (DX) for its customers. Internally, we also practice  data-driven management, continuously collecting  and analyzing human resource data and incorporating  the insights gained into our human resource mea­ sures. Disclosing data on human resources and visual­ izing return on investment of our policies boosts  management transparency. This approach also helps  elucidate the ways in which human capital manage­ ment bolsters corporate value. However, in human  resource-related areas alone, the factors that have  the potential to influence the growth of our financial  value are numerous. As a result, we have not yet been  able to complete a sufficiently quantitative analysis  of the relationship between recruitment, training, and  other human resource measures and business  growth. We will continue to utilize the latest technol­ ogy to more effectively leverage data, and work to  enhance the Group’s corporate value through more  effective human resource measures. 	 In addition to CHRO, since June 2024 I have also  served as a board member, an appointment I believe  has been significant in communicating that the  Group considers human resources one the most  important elements of capital and vital to the  enhancement of corporate value. Understanding the  value that the Group’s business activities provide to  customers and society, as well as the culture and  structure that encourages employees to take on chal­ lenges and grow independently, are important to our  efforts to continue attracting talented people in this  era of intense competition for human resources. I  believe my role is to reinforce the Group’s human  capital by implementing its human resource strate­ gies, and to actively communicate the significance  and results of our human capital management.

Through such discussions, we have formulated a  Human Capital Value Improvement Model, a concep­ tual framework that each company can use when  considering its own human capital management. 	 The Fujitsu Group also uses this model to identify  “short-term initiatives to produce results” and “long- term initiatives to produce sustainable effects” to  help realize management and business strategies in  line with its Human Capital Value Creation Model,  and promotes human capital management in a well- balanced manner. Specific measures in the first cate­ gory include formulating a people portfolio to realize  our business strategy and recruiting and assignment  of human resources and designing compensation to  bring the strategy into reality. The second category  includes such measures as promoting DE&I through  GRB (Global Responsible Business), well-being,  health management, and promoting labor safety and  health, operating position-based human resource  management and internal job-posting systems,  encouraging regular one-on-one dialogue between  managers and subordinates, and providing on- demand training programs that support each  employee to learn autonomously. 	 At the same time, we are working to establish a  cycle for improving measures as human resource  strategies evolve and times change. We are also  seeking to clarify these measures’ relationships with  corporate value by analyzing and disclosing data and  making visible the return on investment of human  resource-related measures. Specifically, we are scien­ tifically analyzing the effects of measures and making  continuous improvements by utilizing human resource  data collected as part of our global employee survey  and through our data-driven management. For exam­ ple, previous analyses have shown that personnel  transferred through internal job-­posting (our open  recruitment system for human resources) and the  recruitment of mid-career personnel correlate posi­ tively with the rate of growth in financial indicators.  This suggests that better mobilization of human  resources, which assumes employees take ownership  of their careers, may help increase corporate value.

This move was designed to make us more com­ petitive in attracting human resources.  To become more competitive in recruiting experienced workers in  high-priority areas of our business strategy, such as cybersecurity,  AI, data science, and 3S, we will continue to offer the “Highly  Specialized Personnel Compensation System,” a system that  ­provides add-on reward for employees with strong expertise in  ­relevant areas.  We will begin studying the process of visualizing and monitoring a  people portfolio based on three axis: business, role, and region. We  will determine headcount requirements by role in line with the busi­ ness portfolio, leading to strategic recruitment and assignment of  human resources to growth areas and implementation of human  resource development measures, including reskilling and upskilling.  To expand our consulting capabilities, we are focusing on referrals  and rehires, with plans to reskill or recruit approximately 1,000 mid- career personnel.  We will continue to focus on training engineers with SAP,  Salesforce, and ServiceNow (3S) skills.  We will extend position-based human resource management to  new graduate hires (from April 2026). We will do away with the  system of starting salaries based on academic background, in  which uniform amounts are offered based on undergraduate or  master’s degrees. Instead, we will offer salary commensurate with  the ability to perform jobs that require a high level of expertise, to  attract more talented and diverse human resources.  At the same time, we will expand our paid internship program from  one to six months, providing opportunity for diverse human  resources to understand and experience working at Fujitsu.

Accordingly, we  have established employee engagement as a  non-financial indicator. 	 Our target value, a benchmark of global  companies, is 75. In fiscal 2023, employee  engagement remained unchanged year on  year, at 69. Going forward, we plan to more  effectively leverage the data we collect,  extracting insights as we continue to develop  best practices to meet the agendas we face. Together with the position-based human  resource management system that we intro­ duced in fiscal 2020, we significantly expanded  our internal job-posting system with the aim of  promoting job mobility and diversity to realize  our business strategy. We expanded this system  onto a global scale in fiscal 2022. Over the  course of four years, we have received more than  27,000 applicants, and about 10,000 employees  have changed their positions. Notably, we have  adopted our internal job-posting system in  which all new managers go through a selection  process based on the system. We will continue  to provide employees with opportunities for  growth through this measure. To realize a corporate culture in which diverse  human resources can leverage their capabilities  and express their values, in fiscal 2023 we set  the percentage of female managers as one of  our non-financial indicators, targeting a rate of  30% by the end of fiscal 2030. As a milestone  toward that goal, we aim to achieve a 20% ratio  of female managers by the end of fiscal 2025. 	 In addition to these efforts, we will continue  to promote various other initiatives, such as  “mindset shift,” “positive action,” and “improving  the working environment through Work Life  Shift promotion.” The Group has developed an on-demand train­ ing platform that allows employees to select  and take the training they need on their own.  We introduced LinkedIn Learning in fiscal 2023;  as of June 2024, it was used by approximately  80% of employees. Looking at the combination  for LinkedIn Learning and Udemy, the number  of participants and total learning time in Japan  have grown significantly since fiscal 2020 by  4.8 times and 4.4 times, respectively. As these  figures show, autonomous learning has become  standard over the past four years.

Before I applied through the Global  Job Opportunities, I tried to gain an  accurate understanding of the HR pro­ cess associated with the new position. I  checked the posting information regu­ larly and focused in particular on the operational process and  procedures related to global assignments. Because I thought  first-hand information was important, I consulted directly with  the reporting manager of the new posting to get a better under­ standing of specific roles, expectations, scope of responsibilities,  and business situation. I also obtained information about career  and living conditions from local colleagues, helping to clarify the  image of my own active role after my expatriation.  	 Through the Global Job Opportunities, I feel that I have grown  more than I had initially expected. I succeeded in forging per­ sonal networks both inside and outside the Group, forming the  habit of thinking from a medium- to long-term perspective with  an awareness of the issues at stake, taking the initiative to  develop a career I am passionate about, and adopting the work  attitude of “fail fast and learn faster.” There are issues that can be  seen only from being on the front lines in the U.S., where compe­ tition is fierce and trial-and-error is repeated on a daily basis. First,  we will continue to contribute to the execution of growth strate­ gies centered on Fujitsu Uvance through an issue-driven  approach based on a correct understanding and analysis of such  issues and the actual situation of our customers.  Since joining the Company as a busi­ ness producer (a “BP,” the Group’s term  for a salesperson), I had always consid­ ered “clarifying issues” to be an essen­ tial skill, but I always had a nagging  suspicion that I might not really be fully  understanding the issues customers  faced when I prepared proposals.  When I was assigned to my first DX  project, I was unable to explain my pro­ posal in my own words. This was a  crisis; I could not go on like this. 	 Through the Job Challe!! system, I decided to apply for a  position in the data consulting department. I thought that  being in this challenging environment for a limited period of  time would provide me with experience that would be an asset  to my career as a BP. 	 I gained three things through Job Challe!! First, I learned the  art of engaging in day-to-day operations and negotiations from  a wide range of perspectives including those required as a BP,  from a project management perspective, and from a risk man­ agement perspective. Second, I gained an awareness of high- quality output. It was a particularly good experience for me to  formulate hypotheses based on publicly available information  and past experiences, clarify issues that customers were not  aware of, and create appealing proposals, especially when we  were unable to obtain information from customers directly. The  third thing was pride in my work. I have noticed that having this  pride creates pressure to meet expectations both internally and  externally. This pressure, in turn, reinforces a sense of commit­ ment to results and improves the quality of output. I hope to  internalize what I have learned in this position as my own  strength and work even harder as a BP. Job Challe!! system Since joining the Group, I had been a  BP targeting the pharmaceutical and  medical industries. However, I wanted  to help solve problems at a level closer  to the customer. My hope was to transi­ tion to a system engineer (SE) position,  so I took a reskilling training course  toward becoming an SE in charge of  system implementation. As this would  mean a major career change, I expected  the hurdles to be high. At the same  time, I thought it would be a unique  opportunity to receive intensive train­ ing in a new area of business, so I vol­ unteered to take on the challenge. 	 Midway through my training period, I applied for a position  through the internal job-posting system and transferred to my  current department, meeting my goal of becoming an SE with  around two months of study. However, these two months  helped to dispel my anxiety about changing careers, as I was  able to systematically learn the basic behaviors and technical  skills related to system integration as an SE at Fujitsu. Team  exercises also helped me to interact for the first time with  people in different professions. This broadened my knowledge,  stimulated me, and increased my motivation. 	 Having used the internal job-posting system to change posi­ tions, nowadays I am involved in implementing and expanding  the sales of solutions for acute care settings. I hope to help  resolve issues in the medical field by combining the problem- solving skills developed in my sales career and the technical  knowledge I gained during reskilling.

Our own IP and the combination of our own IP and IP  from other companies are both the keys to develop­ ing unique offerings and the source of the added  value these offerings generate. When offering ser­ vices that combine IP in this manner, it becomes even  more important to demonstrate the Group’s unique­ ness, highlighting capabilities only Fujitsu can provide.  To secure this uniqueness, the Group’s Intellectual  Property Division is responsible for IP management,  including patent prosecution from a legal perspective. 	 The Group’s technology strategy focuses R&D  resources on five Key Technologies (KTs), with their  core in artificial intelligence (AI), which is essential for  digital services such as Fujitsu Uvance. Under this strat­ egy, the share of the five KTs is increasing in the  Group’s IP portfolio. In particular, the number of  patent applications for AI-related technology, which  has accumulated research and development since the  1980s, ranked first in Japan in fiscal 2023, following  fiscal 2022. Focus on IP for applied technology In addition to core technology IP, which has histori­ cally been a strength for the Group, now we are focus­ ing on IP prosecution in the area of AI applied  technologies. Applied technologies refer to technolo­ gies that fuse core technologies with knowledge  about specific industries and applications such as  those implemented in Fujitsu Uvance’s offerings, or  technologies that fuse AI and the other four KTs. 	 IP prosecution for applied technologies is linked to  our business strategy of accelerating the fusion of  the five KTs, with AI at their core, into Fujitsu Uvance.  In line with the business strategy announced in  February 2024 to provide Fujitsu Uvance with the  Fujitsu Kozuchi AI platform, we are working to build  an IP portfolio of applied technologies. Enhancing dialogue between research and IP  divisions We are strengthening cooperation between the  Research Division and Intellectual Property Division.  One specific example is identifying areas where  resources should be invested in prosecution in accor­ dance with the IP utilization policy developed based  on the Group’s technology strategy and the current  state of its IP portfolio. To gain competitive advan­ tages, the Intellectual Property Division analyzes the  strengths of the technologies under development in  the marketplace with IP information and feeds these  results back to the Research Division, and identify  areas where international standardization and open  source software (OSS) should be actively utilized and  promote the efforts. Furthermore, we will deepen col­ laboration between the Intellectual Property Division  and business divisions to promote stronger Group  offerings through R&D technologies in order to  enhance the added value of Fujitsu Uvance’s offerings. 	 In addition to IP prosecution of technologies, IP man­ agement contributes to value creation through various  approaches, including design and brand prosecution, IP  license management in the area of open innovation, and  strategic use of international standards, rules, and OSS.  IP management, including preventing other companies  from infringing on the Group’s rights, appropriate IP  management, and compliance, is also an effort to iden­ tify and reduce risks related to intellectual property that  may damage corporate value. We are striving to contin­ uously enhance corporate value by promoting IP man­ agement that aligns with our management strategy,  technology strategy, and portfolio strategy.

OneFujitsu applies solutions used as global stan­ dards, such as SAP and Salesforce, to ensure that the  global definitions of business processes are uniform  and standardized. 	 We have also developed a package of measures  such as reskilling that encourage employees to change  their behavior. This is essential for improving the ­quality  of OneData (data that is consistent Groupwide), and  maximizing the effects of data-driven management. We  have rolled out this package across the Group. In addi­ tion, we have honed an agile and speedy approach  to improvement. This  approach centers on  close and ongoing  discussions with man­ agement in the use of  technology, including  AI, and in the construc­ tion of dashboards that  are displayed atop the  data infrastructure. * A state in which a company main­ tains a unique advantage that  competitors cannot emulate by  aiming for operational efficiency  and improvement Creating value by utilizing practical knowledge  and expertise Alongside these efforts, the Group has established an  organization to promote data-driven management and  developed a scheme to consolidate the knowledge  and know-how gained through the global develop­ ment of OneFujitsu-related initiatives and best prac­ tices for data utilization in various internal departments.  The Group has accumulated a wealth of practical  knowledge and expertise as a result of its experience in  confronting and overcoming a variety of transformation  challenges. These include formulating strategies for  realizing data-driven management, establishing a strat­ egy promotion system, studying implementation meth­ ods, and developing various frameworks and programs  for Groupwide deployment. 	 The Group applies this practical knowledge and exper­ tise to its proposals for solving the business challenges  customers face. This expertise amounts to crucial man­ agement capital, as it adds value to the Group’s offerings  and services, including consulting services, modernization,  and Fujitsu Uvance, and constitutes a source of competi­ tive advantage for the Group in these areas. Realizing data-based management The Group’s data-driven management continues to  evolve as the OneFujitsu Program progresses.  Specifically, OneCRM was operational in 31 countries  as of 2022, with 20,000 Group employees from man­ agement to frontline business staff able to monitor  comprehensive and granular data along a time axis. We  are gaining the ability to predict physical market trends  and optimize our management and business strategies  accordingly. 	 In addition, OneERP+, which converts tangible and  intangible management resources into data and  makes them visible, has begun operations at Fujitsu  Limited and Fujitsu Japan Limited, marking a major  milestone for data-driven management. In the area of  purchasing, for instance, the new system facilitates  seamless linking among all processes, from compiling  the information needed to place orders all the way to  paying suppliers. The system will offer centralized  management of all data, including necessary forms  and documents. The system will also facilitate visual­ ization of procurement and supplier status across the  entire Group. 	 We will continue working to realize data-driven  management and achieve operational excellence by  upgrading our business management and service  structure based on OneERP+ and extending the  reach of our data infrastructure to all regions.

We will  ­integrate the references obtained through practice  into our business and contribute to our customers'  sustainability transformation. 55 Fujitsu Integrated Report 2024  ===== PAGE 57 ===== Message from the CSSO (Chief Sustainability & Supply Chain Officer) Gearing up for the practical phase The Fujitsu Group’s Materiality clearly states its intent  to positively impact customers and society through its  business, indicating that the Group has advanced from  encouraging employees to take ownership of sustain­ ability, by fostering an awareness of its importance  and understanding Our Purpose, to creating an impact  through its business activities. Furthermore, we have  moved on to the stage of linking this impact to our  market valuation—to enhancing our corporate value. 	 For example, supply chain priorities have tradition­ ally focused on managing risk factors that could  negatively impact the Group’s business, beginning  with environmental stewardship and respect for  human rights and continuing with compliance, ensur­ ing economic security, and enhancing information  security. However, the question now is how to gain  the empathy of partners and work together to  manage the supply chain from a sustainability per­ spective, creating an overall positive impact and con­ tributing to the Group’s corporate value. 	 I was appointed CSSO in April 2024, and the addi­ tion of sustainability to my existing responsibilities in  the supply chain has made me realize the importance  of my role in shifting the Fujitsu Group’s sustainability  management to the practical phase. The impact we pursue through our business My role as CSSO in this new phase is to create a  mechanism to make the Fujitsu Group’s vision reso­ nate with employees, business partners, and other  stakeholders, and to put this vision into practice.  Specifically, we will organize KPIs so that employees  can think about Materiality in relation to their own  work, measure their impact using metrics that are  widely accepted both internally and externally, while  also taking external indicators into consideration, and  communicate the progress. 	 To ensure this practice gains traction, we also need  to integrate sustainability into the business strategy  and establish a mechanism to promote sustainability in  all business groups and functional sections within the  organization. This includes integrating the knowledge  and expertise the Group has accumulated through  sustainability management into Fujitsu Uvance and  other businesses, and converting it into value for cus­ tomers and society. We will reference the Group’s  experiences by making the correlation and causality  between financial and non-financial indicators visible,  so we can assist customers in their own transformation  to sustainability. 	 As CSSO, my role is to connect the sustainability  initiatives of organizations within the Fujitsu Group.  I will contribute to enhancing corporate value by  ensuring the permeation of sustainability and focus­ ing on building a framework to advance initiatives  that produce an impact through our business. We focus on ­sustainability  ­management that  ­contributes to ­enhancing  corporate value.

We aim to grow over the long term while generating a positive impact on society. To realize  this goal, we are promoting sustainability management under the guidance of our senior management team. Sustainability Management Committee The Fujitsu Group has established the Sustainability  Management Committee, which will drive a sustainability  focused management approach under the supervision and  direction of the Board of Directors meeting and the Executive  Management Council meeting. The committee is tasked with  discussing how a responsible global company should con­ duct sustainability management in order to realize long-term  growth and transformation, while taking into consideration  environmental, social, and economic impacts, as well as all of  the Group’s stakeholders. The committee is chaired by the  CEO and comprises executives or SVPs appointed by the  chairperson. As of September 2024, the committee had 15  members, including the chairperson. The committee meets  once every six months, and each agenda item is designed for  discussion, not just a description of activities. 	 Based on Our Purpose and Our Values as set out in the  Fujitsu Way, we identified issues that are deeply connected  to the sources of the Fujitsu Group’s value creation. These  included respect for human rights, acceptance of diversity  and equity, human resource development, maintenance of  the global environment, and contributing to the develop­ ment of regional communities. We refer to such matters as  GRB (Global Responsible Business), and our activities in  these areas have been reported and discussed in the com­ mittee since fiscal 2020. Moreover, based on the Materiality  defined in 2023, we have assigned an executive for each  Materiality, and we are discussing non-financial indicators  and confirming progress in relation to our non-financial  impact on customers and society through our business  activities. In this way, we aim to increase the corporate  value of the Fujitsu Group sustainably over the long term.

In fiscal 2023, we met all  our targets, which we set by backcasting from the fiscal 2025 targets. Environmental Action Plan Stage XI (fiscal 2023–2025) Goal Base line Targets for fiscal 2025 Fiscal 2023 results Customers and society • Fiscal 2023: Environmental contribution metrics will be developed.

However, as the global community accelerates its efforts to  become carbon neutral, the Fujitsu Group is reexamining the role it should play in  ­society. Accordingly, we now aim to meet our target of “zero CO2 emissions by the  Fujitsu Group by fiscal 2050” by fiscal 2030—20 years ahead of the original schedule. Reduction of GHG emissions from business activities (Scope 1 and 2) 	 We have also established a new target to achieve net zero*2 GHG emissions for  the entire value chain (Scope 1, 2, and 3) by fiscal 2040. This target, which sets fiscal  2020 as the base year for reaching net zero by fiscal 2040, was validated as net zero  by the SBTi in June 2023. *2 Refers to reducing GHG emissions by at least 90% from the emissions in the base fiscal year by the target fiscal year, then removing  10% of lower residual emissions by absorbing atmospheric CO2 through the use of Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology and  afforestation Efforts to achieve net zero The Fujitsu Group is actively procuring and strategically expanding its use of renew­ able energy both in Japan and overseas in order to achieve RE100 by 2030. In Japan,  the goal is to source 100% of electricity used at major data centers from renewable  energy by 2025. Fujitsu Australia sourced 47% of electricity used at its data centers  from renewable energy sources in fiscal 2023. This  was due to the company’s signing in 2022 of a  Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with CWP  Renewables (at the time); this is the Fujitsu Group’s  largest PPA. We will continue to provide low-GHG- emission services to our customers. We also intend  to expand our use of renewable energy and con­ tribute to climate change adaptation by introduc­ ing renewable energy sources additionally and  further improving energy efficiency. Initiatives to realize a circular economy Now that the concept of a “circular economy” has evolved into a global trend, the  Fujitsu Group needs to consider a circular economy business model that matches  the characteristics of individual products, and to design products to match this new  business model. Environmental Action Plan (Stage XI) calls for the development of  products and services that contribute to a circular economy business model. We  held a briefing and workshop on circular economy business in September 2023,  mainly targeting the design and development departments of Group products, and  established activity targets for each product business unit. Going forward, we will  promote service developments that center on our products.

In addition to our own response to climate change risks, we believe that examining the potential climate  change risks affecting our customers and making value creation proposals to them using our strengths in digital technology will also lead to business opportunities. 	 As a result, we have also strengthened our governance as we aggressively promote initiatives on management strategies for climate change countermeasures. In April 2019,  we announced our support for the recommendations issued by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and we are working to disclose information  effectively to various stakeholders, including investors. For more details, see TCFD-based information disclosure, including scenario analysis Item  Response status Governance Oversight structure under the Board of  Directors for climate-related risks and  opportunities • The Sustainability Management Committee shares the risks and opportunities arising from climate change, deliberates on medium- and long-term issues, and formulates policies. These  results are reported to the Board of Directors via the Executive Management Council. In fiscal 2021, the results of analysis using multiple climate change scenarios, including limiting global  warming to 1.5°C, were reported on and discussed by the Sustainability Management Committee. • Important risks identified for the overall Group, including climate risk, are reported periodically to the Board of Directors by the Risk Management & Compliance Committee. Role of management in assessing and  managing climate-related risks and  opportunities • The representative director and CEO serves as the chair of the Sustainability Management Committee, with responsibility for the highest level of decision-making and for business execution.

The statement has been translated into  21 languages and is disseminated to all Group companies, as well as to suppliers for  their agreement and support. 	 An organization to spearhead human rights efforts has been established within  the CEO office, which reports directly to the president. This organization works with  corporate and business divisions to implement activities aimed at resolving human  rights issues throughout the value chain. We have also set up a program of regular  meetings with human rights staff in each region to promote the program globally.  Activities are reported to and discussed by the Sustainability Management  Committee, which is chaired by the president, and results are reported to the  Executive Management Council and the Board of Directors. Promoting human rights due diligence Adopted the TNFD framework Expressing its agreement with the framework of the Taskforce on Nature-related  Financial Disclosures (TNFD), the Fujitsu Group registered as a TNFD Adopter. The TNFD  announced our adoption at the Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos,  Switzerland. We plan to conduct an assessment in line with the LEAP approach and  conduct disclosure from 2024 onward in accordance with the disclosure items recom­ mended under the TNFD framework. We will gradually update our disclosure content. Nature-oriented initiatives Formulation of our vision and short- and medium-term targets The Fujitsu Group has formulated its vision for 2050, medium-term target for 2030, and  short-term target for 2025 (Environmental Action Plan Stage XI). Established in line with  the Kunming-Montreal GBF, these targets aim to move us along a nature-positive pathway. Vision (2050) Create a world in harmony with nature, where “nature and biodiversity,” which are funda­ mental to a sustainable society, are fully restored through digital technology Medium-term target  (2030) Reduce negative impacts on biodiversity by at least 25% (base year: fiscal 2020) in the  area of company’s corporate activities, including supply chain, and promote activities to  increase positive impacts on it. Short-term target  (2025) Reduce negative impacts on biodiversity by at least 12.5% (base year: fiscal 2020) in the  area of company’s corporate activities, including supply chain, and promote activities to  increase positive impacts on it. Examples of activities that reduce negative  impacts on biodiversity An evaluation of the Fujitsu Group’s overall cor­ porate activities, using the Ecological Footprint  (EF) as a metric, identified “CO2 emissions” and  “energy use” as accounting for 99% of factors.  Accordingly, we concluded that our climate  change measures are effective at reducing  ­negative impacts on biodiversity. Examples of activities that increase positive impacts on biodiversity The Fujitsu Numazu Plant has been certified as a Nationally Certified Sustainably  Managed Natural Site (site for symbiosis with nature) by the Japanese Ministry of the  Environment, contributing to achievement of the 30by30 target.

We identified 18 human rights  issues affecting three rights holders in Fujitsu’s value chain (supply chain, employees,  and customers/consumers/communities) and are working on prevention and mitiga­ tion measures, starting with high-priority issues. 	 In relation to “supplier and labor standards,” “forced, bonded and compulsory  labor,” and “child labor” in the supply chain, we ask our suppliers to improve their  working environment, eliminate forced and child labor, and conduct regular surveys. 	 Addressing the topics of working conditions and non-discrimination and equal  opportunity among employees, we have introduced flexible working hours and tele­ commuting systems to improve work-life balance and reduce long working hours. In  addition, we strive to improve the work environment and foster respect for each and  every employee through employee engagement surveys as well as education on  human rights, biases, and other topics. 	 With regard to privacy and information security and the ethical use of technology  for customers, consumers, and the community, under the leadership of the CISO  (Chief Information Security Officer), we are promoting efforts to ensure and improve  customer information security by continuing to reform the awareness of each  employee and our organizational culture. We also have AI ethics initiatives in place to  address the risks associated with data handling and the use of artificial intelligence. 	 The Fujitsu Group sets a goal to engage in dialogue with stakeholders once a  year. In March 2024, we invited human rights experts from the United Nations  Development Programme (UNDP) and Caux Round Table Japan (CRT Japan) as ­external  experts to evaluate and provide suggestions on human rights promotion.*1 	 In November 2023, we joined the “Engagement and Remedy Platform,” which is operated  and provided by the Japan Center for Engagement and Remedy on Business and  Human Rights (JaCER).*2 By accepting complaints through a third party, we foster fairness  and transparency in the handling of complaints and promote dialogue and redress. AI ethics and human rights Rapid advances in information and communication technologies, especially AI, are  changing people’s lives and the society significantly. At the same time, some AI use  can have serious consequences, leading to inequality, discrimination, and other  human rights violations, and AI can have unforeseen side effects. 	 The Fujitsu Group has been promoting the concept of being “human centric” for  many years, and aiming to realize a human-centric ICT society. In 2019, we formu­ lated the “Fujitsu Group AI Commitment” as a guideline to support our customers’  business transformation as a trusted business partner. In this guideline, we discipline  ourselves as an AI developer and provider and as a trusted business partner to our  customers. In 2022, we established the AI ethics and Governance Office to lead the  Group’s governance from the perspective of AI ethics, and are promoting its global  expansion and implementation as described below. 	 Since 2019, Fujitsu has regularly held meetings of the “Fujitsu Group External  Advisory Committee on AI ethics” to obtain objective evaluations of our AI ethics  efforts from external experts in AI technology as well as a diverse range of non-AI  experts, including people from the legal, biomedical, environmental, consumer  affairs, and ecological fields. Committee meetings are attended by the CEO and  other C-suite managers involved in AI-related R&D and business. The committee’s  discussions are also shared with the Board of Directors to ensure transparency  among our organizational management. Our progressive initiatives have been  recognized as meaningful efforts to link AI ethics with corporate governance. 	 We also believe it is essential for each employee to understand the importance  of AI ethics and to practice self-discipline. In fiscal 2020 we introduced mandatory  e-learning on AI ethics in Japan region. In fiscal 2023, 93% of all Group employees  in Japan region completed the e-learning course, and global regions are currently  promoting similar training in AI ethics. In the AI delivery process, we are working to  address AI-specific risks with existing quality and security processes, as well as  mandating independent reviews on ethical aspects. 	 In addition to fostering AI ethics within the Group, we encourage discussions on  AI ethics with next generation through industry–academia collaboration activities.  We work actively to share our efforts toward and knowledge of AI ethics to consum­ ers and user companies that come into direct contact with consumers. Furthermore,  we provide user companies with our “Fujitsu Generative AI Guidelines” and tools to  detect ethical risks related to AI.

We drive our supply chain strategies from both financial and non-financial  viewpoints.  	 On the financial side, the Company is promoting collaboration with strategic part­ ners based on its seven Key Focus Areas. To prepare a foundation to support busi­ ness growth, we are working to standardize and automate operations when  procuring other companies’ services, and taking steps to deal with IT personnel  shortages by using IT personnel databases that we share with our partners. This  system ensures that we can secure the necessary personnel when needed. 	 On the non-financial side, aiming to realize responsible procurement in our own  supply chain, we have established a global coordination structure and we are working  together with each region in planning and operations. Moreover, we promote inte­ grated efforts in which key social issues such as human rights, diversity, compliance,  and the environment are addressed in our supply chain. To this end, we coordinate  closely with relevant business units to promote initiatives. Building responsible supply chains In its supply chain, the Fujitsu Group will achieve responsible procurement that  embraces diversity and gives full consideration to human rights, the environment,  and health & safety. We are promoting sustainable procurement activities as  part of what Fujitsu aspires to be. In 2005, we formulated the Fujitsu Group CSR  Procurement Guideline, and in 2018 we adopted the Code of Conduct of the  Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), a shared global industry initiative, as part of the  guideline. In 2023, in light of demand for stronger human rights-related measures,  this was revised to the Fujitsu Group Sustainable Procurement Guideline and now  applies to the entire supply chain, including service suppliers. We are also working  with suppliers to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the supply chain by  holding briefing sessions with major suppliers and requesting that they set numerical  targets in line with international standards. 	 Furthermore, to ensure supply chain diversity, in each region and country we are  promoting procurement from companies with diverse characteristics, such as small  and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and companies owned by women or operated  by ethnic minorities. In addition, in selecting suppliers, we conduct due diligence and  provide training on information security and compliance. PACT program As a member of the Partnership for Carbon Transparency (PACT), which is spon­ sored by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), Fujitsu  participated in the PACT Implementation Program. This is the world’s first social  implementation program for linking product carbon footprint (PCF) information as  intercompany data. As a result, we have succeeded in making CO2 emissions visible  throughout actual supply chains. 	 In this implementation, Fujitsu took the supply chain of Fujitsu’s notebook PC  enclosures as an example. We used a PACT-compliant Fujitsu solution based on the  Pathfinder Network, a technical specification for data linkage. The “ESG Management  Platform/Fujitsu Track and Trust” and other solutions were used to calculate the CO2  emissions of PCFs and link actual data. We also identified issues in the real supply  chain, such as improving supplier engagement and building ecosystems, through  PCF data links using actual supplier data. 	 We have called on various suppliers to accelerate and expand the scale of this  activity, as well as to develop better interface solutions based on the experience of  the world’s first social implementation. We share the significance and methodology  of data linkage and PCF calculation, which is a measure for setting GHG emissions  targets and achieving reductions. As a provider of a PACT conformant solution, in  addition to our own efforts, we will contribute to the realization of a sustainable soci­ ety by formulating a concrete action plan to achieve our goal of net zero emissions  throughout the value chain by fiscal 2040.

In this way,  we promote and implement our Code of Conduct and GBS throughout the Group. 	 Along with personal messages from the president to all employees in Japan and  overseas repeatedly declaring the Company’s commitment to eliminating bid rig­ ging, cartels, and other compliance violations, regional heads and Group company  managers overseas share messages on an ongoing basis stressing the importance of  compliance and a corporate culture of zero tolerance of fraud (zero tolerance). 	 In addition, we have designated December 9–15 as Fujitsu Compliance Week to  coincide with International Anti-Corruption Day as advocated by the United Nations.  During this week, the president and members of management at Fujitsu headquarters  along with the presidents of Group companies in each country share coordinated com­ pliance messages with employees. We also provide an annually updated e-learning  course on compliance for all Group company employees and offer compliance-related  activities planned for each region. 	 In addition to these top-down initiatives, we collect ideas and strategies from  employees on how to avoid compliance violations through surveys. The valuable  insights gathered from these surveys are then published on the Group intranet,  ­providing an opportunity for employees to learn from each other. Compliance training We provide compliance e-learning for all Fujitsu Group executives and employees  annually (for approximately 120,000 people in 14 languages). The participation rate  is high, at over 95% annually. In fiscal 2023, we also  conducted training on fair business practices for  employees and around 211 partner companies. We  plan to continue these programs every year. For more details, see compliance Compliance Fujitsu Way Code of Conduct Fujitsu Way Code of Conduct­­ The Fujitsu Way contains a Code of Conduct,  which outlines the fundamental principles that  all Fujitsu Group employees should abide by,  as shown on the right. Fujitsu has also refined  its Fujitsu Way Code of Conduct by develop- ing the Global Business Standards (GBS) in 14  languages to serve as a guide on legally com- pliant behavior for all Fujitsu Group-affiliated  employees worldwide and applies the GBS  uniformly across the Fujitsu Group. Global Compliance Program Fujitsu has developed the Fujitsu Global  Compliance Program (GCP) to implement and  disseminate the Fujitsu Way Code of Conduct  and the GBS, and is working to maintain and  improve the Fujitsu Group’s global legal com­ pliance structure. The GCP organizes Fujitsu’s  various compliance-related activities into five  pillars in a systematic manner, and promotes  external understanding of Fujitsu’s compliance  structure and its compliance activities, in addi­ tion to clarifying what items Fujitsu needs to  address on a continual basis. Based on this  GCP, we implement various policies and initia­ tives in each region, taking into account  ­factors such as each country and region’s  legal systems and government guidelines.

Under the 2024 theme of “Rebuilding Trust,” forum discussions focused on  such topics as geopolitical risks, including the situation in the Middle East and  Ukraine, problems with new technologies represented by generative AI, and energy  and other resource issues. 	 On the topic of AI in particular, speakers reported progress on innovations in gener­ ative AI, and discussions covered the risks posed by generative AI and how to deal  with them. Securing employment due to the spread of AI was noted as a major issue,  and other discussions covered responsible AI to ensure employment, cultivating digital  human resources, and the state of AI regulation. 	 At the forum, Takahito Tokita (Fujitsu’s CEO) and Hidenori Furuta (then COO, now  chairman), along with political and business leaders, were able to share WEF’s global  agenda, including economic security, sustainability and the future of new technologies  such as DX and generative AI. 	 In addition, for the second year in a row,  the Fujitsu Group set up its own booth at the  Fujitsu Uvance House, the only one of its kind  by a Japanese company. At this booth,  Yoshinami Takahashi (then corporate execu­ tive officer, now COO) and Taeko Yamamoto  (corporate executive officer), and others net­ worked with government officials and top  corporate executives from various countries.  At a roundtable discussion co-sponsored  with the Financial Times, we deepened our  relationships with the senior management of  key customers. 	 As a World Economic Forum Partner, the  Fujitsu Group will work toward realizing the  themes of this year’s Annual Meeting by link­ ing its global agenda with the Group’s  Materiality, and leading the formation of a  global consensus as a technology company  working to achieve a net positive outcome. World Business Council for Sustainable Development The World Business Council for Sustainable  Development (WBCSD) is an international community  of more than 230 companies around the world. Fujitsu  has been participating in the WBCSD since 2013, and  since 2018, Fujitsu executives have also served as the  vice chair and a member of the Executive Committee,  working with member companies to accelerate the  system’s transformation through business in accordance with the vision* set forth by  the WBCSD. 	 Through its participation in wide-ranging WBCSD initiatives, Fujitsu works with  various organizations and companies across sectors to mutually enhance knowledge  and examine and enact best practices. Main initiatives  Fujitsu embarks on digital collaboration with WBCSD for carbon neutral transpor­ tation: Fujitsu has commenced digital collaboration with the WBCSD, Dutch con­ sulting firm Arcadis, and British electricity company National Grid, leveraging  Fujitsu’s Fleet Optimization solution. By charging electric vehicles (EVs) during  hours when green power is abundant, fleet operators have seen a 15% reduction in  CO2 emissions from EV charging.  Development of Integrated Performance Management (IPM), a framework for  integrating ESG into decision-making processes: Fujitsu has been involved in the  IPM project, collaborating with other companies, and developed a report on IPM in  2023. This report presents Fujitsu’s case study and demonstrates the importance  of its strong commitment from corporate leaders to achieve the purpose. 	 We will continue to actively engage in the activities of the WBCSD, which shares  a common direction with the Group’s purpose, and contribute to the realization of  a sustainable future. * WBCSD vision: A world in which more than 9 billion people are able to live well, within planetary boundaries, by 2050 For more details, see collaboration with external parties For more details, see the implementation of a demonstration test  to achieve carbon-neutral transportation through data sharing For more details, see Integrated Performance Management (IPM) The Fujitsu Uvance House booth (inside) The Fujitsu Uvance House booth (outside) Fujitsu Group overview   and management policy Management strategy Financial strategy and   business overview Progress and outlook in   focus areas Reinforcing management   capital Sustainability   management Corporate governance Data section 65 Fujitsu Integrated Report 2024 Message from the CSSO Overview of our sustainability  management The environment Human rights Supply chain Compliance Collaboration with stakeholders  ===== PAGE 67 ===== Corporate governance Hiroki Hiramatsu Director and Corporate  Executive Officer, CHRO Takahito Tokita Representative Director  CEO Takuya Hirano Director* Kenichiro Sasae Director* Hidenori Furuta Non-Executive Chairman Yoshiko Kojo Director* Takeshi Isobe Representative Director  CFO Byron Gill Director* Chiaki Mukai Director* Catherine O’Connell Audit & Supervisory Board  Member* Yuuichi Koseki Audit & Supervisory Board  Member Youichi Hirose Audit & Supervisory Board  Member Koji Hatsukawa Audit & Supervisory  Board Member* Hideo Makuta Audit & Supervisory Board  Member* * Independent directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members (Back row from left) (Front row from left) Fujitsu Group overview   and management policy Management strategy Financial strategy and   business overview Progress and outlook in   focus areas Reinforcing management   capital Sustainability   management Corporate governance Data section 66 Fujitsu Integrated Report 2024 Interview with the Chairperson of  the Board of Directors Management Status of corporate governance Risk management Product and service quality Information security  ===== PAGE 68 ===== Q  What are your future aspirations as  Chairperson of the Board of Directors? A  June 2024 marks six full years as an external direc­ tor of the Fujitsu Group, so this new position has a  special significance for me. As chairperson, I believe it is  my mission to improve corporate governance while  emphasizing accountability, transparency, risk manage­ ment, fairness, and responsibility. I will promote discus­ sion at Board of Directors meetings, to help the Board  respond quickly and efficiently to changes in the busi­ ness environment. I encourage our employees to “keep  taking on challenges, even when the going is tough,” so I  will also view chairperson as a tough assignment and  fulfill the responsibilities of the position. 	 Moreover, I will strive to engage in dialogue with  investors and other stakeholders. I understand that  investors expect me to communicate frankly with them  based on how Fujitsu’s management is viewed by the  Board of Directors, the majority of which is composed  of external directors, rather than to explain strategy  specifics or the details of execution. I will do my best  to take part in dialogue and meet these needs. Q  What were issues the Board of Directors  focused on in fiscal 2023? What is your  assessment of progress on the 2023–2025 Medium- Term Management Plan (medium-term plan)? A  The issues the Board of Directors focused on  most were the progress of Fujitsu Uvance,  which is positioned as a growth driver, and its future  growth strategy. We also prioritized discussions on  topics such as quality control, addressing risks, and  the future direction of listed subsidiaries. 	 With regard to the three main initiatives of the  medium-term plan, I believe that its progress  deserves good marks to some extent. That Fujitsu  Uvance’s growth outpaced our forecast, and that rev­ enue and profits in Service Solutions increased, are  signs that the evolution of the Group’s business port­ folio and transformation of the business model are  progressing well. To reliably support customers’ mod­ ernization, we have consolidated our knowledge in  the Modernization Knowledge Center, and are now  ready to make proposals that contribute to our  customers’ business. 	 On the other hand, we still have work to make our  international businesses more profitable. Through  structural reforms, we have made inroads on reorga­ nizing existing businesses; the next step is to achieve  growth and profitability improvement. While the  transformation of our business model in the United  States is commendable, the scale of business is small.  We will continue to monitor the situation closely to  see if similar changes can be implemented in other  regions, as the executive team intends. 	 Non-financial indicators show a trend of improve­ ment, but still require continued efforts, including in  categories such as employee engagement. Capital  allocation is also an important agenda item. To ensure  proper investment returns, the Board of Directors mon­ itors the execution and effectiveness of investments in  R&D, offerings, human resources, internal DX, and many  other areas that are essential for sustainable growth. Interview with the Chairperson of the Board of Directors We asked Ms. Kojo, who is currently a member of Fujitsu’s Executive Nomination Committee and who was  appointed as chairperson of Fujitsu’s Board of Directors on June 24, 2024, about her aspirations as chairperson,  the focus in the role of supervision for medium- to long-term value creation, and the reasons for the selection of  new directors. Yoshiko Kojo Director Professor of Department of  ­International Politics Aoyama Gakuin University School of International Politics,  Economics and Communication Fujitsu Group overview   and management policy Management strategy Financial strategy and   business overview Progress and outlook in   focus areas Reinforcing management   capital Sustainability   management Corporate governance Data section 67 Fujitsu Integrated Report 2024 Interview with the Chairperson of  the Board of Directors Management Status of corporate governance Risk management Product and service quality Information security  ===== PAGE 69 ===== Q  What do you see as the key to sustainable  value creation looking toward 2030? What  do you think are the responsibilities that technol­ ogy companies should fulfill in society? A  We have set forth our vision for 2030, established  Materiality items to realize the vision, considered  what is necessary to realize these Materiality items, and  designed a medium-term plan accordingly. In other words,  the steady implementation of the medium-term plan is a  step toward enhancing the Group’s corporate value. 	 The Group is unique in that it uses technology to  achieve sustainability. The concept of solving social  issues through business already permeates the Group,  so the next step is to achieve sustainability through  Fujitsu Uvance. We recognize that we are in the phase  of implementing value creation through problem-­solving,  by putting the concept into concrete offerings. 	 As a scholar of international politics, I believe that  technology companies have a significant role to play in  solving global issues, including those outlined in the  United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  In reality, it is clear that public–private partnerships are  essential to addressing these issues. Personally, I look  forward to the Group’s efforts to implement technolo­ gies for digital services and contribute to constructing  a better society by creating new values. 	 Quality control of services and products, as well as  their enhancement, are extremely important issues for  fulfilling our responsibilities as a technology company.  The way issues are handled has a major impact on soci­ ety and affects the Group’s reputation. Whenever a qual­ ity issue arises, the Board of Directors discusses it in a  timely manner and regularly reviews the appropriateness  and progress of measures taken on the executive side. Q  Please share with us what the Executive  Nomination Committee focuses on when  recommending new director candidates to the  Board of Directors. A  Mr. Hiramatsu, the CHRO, was proposed as a  candidate because human resource manage­ ment is critical to the Group’s business portfolio trans­ formation. This is identified as an area of focus in the  medium-term plan’s resource strategy. I look forward  to the promotion of HR strategies that go beyond the  development of systems such as job-based human  resource management and lead value creation. 	 In nominating candidates for external director, we  use a skills matrix to focus our search on individuals  with global business acumen and a deep understand­ ing of technology. We determined that Takuya  Hirano, with his extensive experience in technology  companies and management experience in both  Japan and the United States, was the best choice. 	 Some Board members, including myself, do not  have technology backgrounds. We are continuously  learning, such as by attending research institute pre­ sentations, but this “information asymmetry” compared  with the executive side is not easy to fill. The Board of  Directors expects to benefit from Mr. Hirano’s advice,  capably provided based on his understanding of the  global competitive environment and cutting-edge  technology, as the Group aims to develop services that  can be competitive both in Japan and overseas. Q  What discussions took place regarding the  new executive structure with a president  and five vice presidents? A  I understand that the shift to a six-person top  management team is aimed at moving from  a system of centralized authority to one that allows  more efficient and faster decision-making. External  directors expressed concerns that delegating more  authority to the vice presidents under the new struc­ ture might reduce the transparency of information- sharing with the Board of Directors and the  decision-making process. The executive side  responded by quickly strengthening the information- sharing mechanism and ensuring that Board members  could confirm information at any time, even on topics  not raised at management meetings. Q  Please describe the status of succession  planning. A  CEO succession planning is the biggest chal­ lenge in the Executive Nomination Committee,  and we are constantly discussing development plans,  such as tough assignments to future management- level personnel, to ensure that each individual is  enhancing his or her experience and skills. In addition  to executive officers, we also provide opportunities for  interaction with directors, so they can get a better feel  for the next generation of leaders. In April 2024, a con­ ference was held between external directors, external  auditors, and young employees who volunteered to  meet with them, providing a forum for frank, spirited  dialogue. It was encouraging to realize that the younger  employees are strongly motivated to take advantage of  the posting system and other new personnel policies  for their own growth, and to see they understand their  own successes lead to the advancement of the Group.

This mission is  based on Our Purpose, and enables a form of business management that, rather  than pursuing short-term profits, earns the trust of customers and business partners,  motivates employees to work with vitality and pride, and contributes to society.  Through such business management, the Company will grow and enhance corpo­ rate value over the medium to long term. Corporate governance as a foundation for sustainable development In the Materiality formulated in 2023, we identified governance and compliance as  key elements forming the foundation for sustainable development. We are commit­ ted to continuously reviewing our corporate governance, enhancing disclosure to  facilitate collaboration with shareholders and all other stakeholders, and promoting  constructive dialogue with shareholders. Through these efforts, we aim to uphold  the trust placed in us by our shareholders. Reasons for adopting our current corporate governance system We believe that we can ensure a more robust supervisory function by having non- executive directors supervise business execution, with independent oversight provided  by Audit & Supervisory Board members who do not participate in decision-making. In line  with this thinking, we have adopted the form of a company with an Audit & Supervisory  Board system, that establishes the Audit & Supervisory Board, which is composed of the  Audit & Supervisory Board members appointed as an independent agent. 	 The Board of Directors consists mostly of non-executive directors and independent  directors constitute a majority on the Board of Directors, as we believe this arrange­ ment is ideally suited to the correction and remediation of errors, insufficiencies, and  recklessness in business execution. At the core of our non-executive directors are  external directors who have a high degree of independence and diverse perspectives.  In addition, we appoint at least one non-executive director from within the Company  to complement any lack of knowledge about or understanding of our business areas,  corporate culture, or other aspects of the Company. This arrangement enhances the  effectiveness of supervision and advice provided by non-executive directors.

Executive compensation Policy for determining executive compensation [Method of determining the amount of remuneration for directors] In order to make the executive compensation system more transparent, we estab­ lished the Compensation Committee by resolution of the Board of Directors in  October 2009. In addition, the policy for determining the details of individual director  compensation (hereinafter referred to as the “Policy for Determination”) is determined  by the Board of Directors based on the report of the Compensation Committee. 	 In accordance with the following review of executive compensation, compensa­ tion for directors for fiscal 2024 and thereafter will be determined by resolution of  the Board of Directors after deliberation by the Compensation Committee, and  compensation for Audit & Supervisory Board members will be determined based on  discussions by Audit & Supervisory Board members, within the total amount of com­ pensation determined by resolution of the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, based on  the framework of this Policy for Determination (“revised policy”) after changes in  accordance with said review. [Review of executive compensation for fiscal 2024 and thereafter] At meetings held on March 28 and May 29, 2024, the Board of Directors resolved to  make changes to executive compensation from fiscal 2024, based on a recommenda­ tion from the Compensation Committee. Of these, the revision to the performance- based stock compensation plan for executive directors and the revision to the  restricted stock unit plan for external directors were passed as resolutions at the  124th Annual Shareholders’ Meeting held on June 24, 2024. The table below  describes the revised executive compensation from fiscal 2024.

I. Policy on the compensation system and compensation levels • The remuneration system for executive directors consists of the following: “base compensation,”  which is a fixed monthly amount in accordance with the position and responsibilities; “bonuses,”  which are linked to short-term business performance; and “stock compensation,” which is  a medium- to long-term incentive that emphasizes the connection to shareholder value. • With the aim of setting competitive compensation that contributes to securing and main­ taining exceptional talent, compensation levels and compensation ratio by type shall be  determined based on the financial position of the Company, and analyzing the compensa­ tion composition ratio and compensation levels for each executive position and responsi­ bility at global companies in Japan and overseas with similar business lines and similar  scale to those of the Company as benchmarks. • The ratio of performance-based compensation (bonuses and performance-linked stock  compensation) to the total compensation for executive directors shall be determined so  as to strengthen the link between the Group’s financial performance and shareholder  value by setting the higher ratio to the greater responsibilities. • Individual director’s remuneration shall be determined by the Board of Directors after delib­ eration at the Compensation Committee to ensure objectivity, transparency, and fairness.

Our perspectives on each portion of executive compensation [Base compensation] Base compensation is paid to all executives (directors and Audit & Supervisory Board  members). All executives are paid a fixed monthly amount in accordance with their  position and responsibilities. [Bonuses] • Bonuses shall be paid to executive directors. The amount of a bonus shall reflect business  performance in the respective fiscal year. • As a specific evaluation indicator and calculation method, the Company shall adopt an “on  target model” to determine the bonus amount to be paid by setting the base amount in  accordance with the position and responsibilities in advance. The bonus amount is calcu­ lated by multiplying the base amount by the coefficient in accordance with the following  elements: the degree of achievement of the performance targets for the fiscal year based  on the Company’s consolidated revenue, adjusted consolidated operating profit, and core  free cash flow,*1 (financial management target indicators), growth from the previous fiscal  year in the non-financial management target indicators of Customer NPS®,*2 employee  engagement,*3 and diversity leadership (ratio of female managers), and acquisition of the  highest evaluation from a third-party assessment organization on ESG initiatives. *1 Free cash flow excluding special items, such as from sales of businesses, acquisitions, and business model transformation expenses *2 Net Promoter ScoreSM, an indicator to measure “customer loyalty,” which presents the degrees of trust and attachment of customers to  companies, products, and services, in order to understand the degree of improvement and depth of the customer experience (CX) *3 An indicator to measure employees’ willingness and attachment to work voluntarily and independently, and to contribute to their com­ pany, with empathy for the company’s direction and purpose [Stock compensation] (1) Performance-based stock compensation • Bonuses shall be paid to executive directors. The amount of a bonus shall reflect business  performance in the respective fiscal year. • As a specific indicator and calculation method, the Company shall set a base number of  stock units in accordance with the position and responsibilities in advance, and calculate  the number of stock units each fiscal year and at the end of the performance evaluation  period by multiplying the base number of stock units by the coefficient in accordance  with the degree of achievement of performance targets for the performance evaluation  period (three years) based on the Company’s financial management target indicators of  adjusted consolidated operating profit and adjusted EPS, as well as relative TSR compared  to the TOPIX growth rate and the result of comparison of TSR for each company in a pre- selected peer group at the end of the performance evaluation period. At the end of such  period, the total number of shares for each eligible recipient is calculated, with one stock  unit corresponding to one share.

The  representative director and CEO shall endeavor to hold shares equivalent to twice  their annual base compensation within four years after taking office and continue to  hold them during their term of office. [Return of compensation (malus and clawback policy)] In the event of inappropriate accounting, including material ex-post adjustments to  past-year financial results or serious misconduct or compliance violations during the  term of office, the Company may demand a reduction in or return of performance- based compensation (bonuses and performance-based stock compensation) from  an executive director (including executive directors who have retired less than two  years ago), based on a decision of the Board of Directors after deliberation by the  Compensation Committee. 	 As resolved at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, the total amount of base com­ pensation and bonuses to directors shall not exceed ¥1,200 million per year (of  which, the portion for external directors shall not exceed ¥150 million per year). The  performance-based stock compensation for executive directors shall not exceed  ¥2,500 million per year, while the total number of shares to be allocated shall not  exceed 1 million shares per year. The restricted stock units for non-executive direc­ tors shall not exceed ¥100 million per year, while the total number of shares to be  allocated shall not exceed 60,000 shares per year (of which, the portions for external  directors shall not exceed ¥90 million and 53,000 shares per year, respectively). 	 The amount of base compensation for Audit & Supervisory Board members shall  not exceed ¥150 million per year. 4. Succession planning for senior management At Fujitsu, we consider succession planning for senior management, including the  CEO, to be one of the most important issues for the sustained improvement of the  Group’s corporate value. 	 In succession planning, we make every effort to ensure a transparent and objec­ tive process by having the voluntary Executive Nomination Committee spearhead  discussions and evaluations and report the results thereof to the Board of Directors.  This committee is composed solely of non-executive officers, the majority of whom  are independent external directors and one of whom serves as chair. 	 The Executive Nomination Committee defines the requirements for senior man­ agement and makes use of reviews and internal and external assessments of the  candidates to verify, based on multifaceted information, their preparedness includ­ ing suitability, skills, and experience with regard to roles they would be expected to  fulfill in the future. The members of the committee also arrange opportunities for  direct communication with the candidates in an effort to learn more about their  character, thereby continuously nurturing and evaluating candidates for future  senior management with the aim of identifying the most suitable successors. 	 Furthermore, the role of the CEO in this process includes developing candidate pro­ posals and development plans and explaining them to the Executive Nomination  Committee (once a year), providing challenges and executive development programs  necessary for the growth of each candidate based on the discussions and advice of  the committee, and regularly reporting to the committee on the performance and  development progress of candidates. The CEO continuously collaborates with the  committee and participates in this process by committee meetings as an observer.

Policy for strategic shareholdings The Company holds only those strategic shares with clear-cut objectives and positive,  meaningful significance. The Board of Directors examines the weighted average capital  cost of the Company as the standard to evaluate quantitatively whether returns (quan­ titative factors such as dividends and the state of transactions) or risks are well bal­ anced with the cost. If quantitative significance in shareholdings is not found, the Board  of Directors will further evaluate whether there is a qualitative reason that supports the  rationale for continuing to hold those shares and will discuss the continuation of such  holdings. During the fiscal 2023, the Company sold six issues, and at the Board of  Directors meeting held on June 21, 2024, the Board discussed the continuation of the  remaining strategic shareholdings held by the Company at the end of the fiscal year. 	 The Company deals  with strategic shareholders  on an equal footing, just as  it does with other business  partners. Even when stra­ tegic shareholders indicate  their sale of shares, we do  not prevent them from  selling. That said, we  sometimes call upon them  to consider the timing of  the sale or the ways of  selling their shares. 6. Views and policies for Group management and measures to ensure the  effectiveness of corporate governance Fujitsu Limited manages the Fujitsu Group with the aim of achieving continuous  growth and the generation of medium- to long-term corporate value of the entire  Group, while also urging each Group company to realize its potential to the maximum  extent possible. Where the Company needs to seek resources from outside because  they are not available within the Group, we may utilize equity-method affiliates for  purposes such as risk diversification, compliance with foreign investment regulations,  or completing the process of complete acquisition or business withdrawal. 	 For some subsidiaries and equity-method affiliates, we publicly list them with the  aim of further improving their business value through diversification of the capital  procurement necessary for sustainable growth and enhancing the value of the entire  Group. By publicly listing subsidiaries and equity-method affiliates it is possible to  focus on investment in specific businesses rather than just in the Group as a whole,  thus contributing to diversifying investment opportunities. As there are some con­ cerns regarding the possibility of a conflict of interest with minority shareholders and  our publicly listed subsidiaries and equity-method affiliates, we respect the indepen­ dence of their management and make efforts to provide advice and support to  enhance the corporate value of relevant listed subsidiaries and equity method associ­ ates by holding reporting sessions on an as-needed basis. To further promote our pol­ icies for group management, we established a department in February 2020 as a  corporate function that specializes in formulating and conducting plans and measures  for the most suitable group formation and corporate governance, thus handling the  management of the Group including listed subsidiaries and equity-method affiliates. 	 Our policy is to turn non-core listed companies and equity-method affiliates into  strong independent businesses. We will consider their independence from the follow­ ing perspectives: ensuring sustainable growth of the relevant business, maximizing  the Company’s asset value, and considering the best timing for independence. Measures to ensure the effectiveness of corporate governance Fujitsu Limited understands that its publicly listed subsidiaries and equity-method affili­ ate make efforts to enhance corporate governance and provides support for these  efforts. All listed subsidiaries and equity-method affiliate are ensured their indepen­ dence by appointing independent directors and directors dispatched from the Company  to help maximize their corporate value. Also, all listed subsidiaries become a company  with an Audit & Supervisory Committee to strengthen corporate governance. 7. Review of corporate governance in fiscal 2023 In fiscal 2023, the Board of Directors identified the following six themes that should  be focused on in light of the Group’s operating environment. Throughout the year,  these themes were intensively discussed and continuously monitored. Status of corporate governance • Progress on the new Medium-Term  ­Management Plan • Business portfolio transformation • Improving international business profitability • Monitoring and responding to quality and  ­security incidents • Succession planning for directors and other  officers • Methods of efficiently monitoring each theme 160,000 120,000 80,000 40,000 0 320 (Fiscal years) 240 160 80 0 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 (Millions of yen) (Number of issues) Amount of strategic shareholdings recorded on the  ­balance sheet and number of shares held Amount of unlisted shares  (left scale) Amount of shares other than  unlisted shares (left scale) Total number of issues  held (right scale) Fujitsu Group overview   and management policy Management strategy Financial strategy and   business overview Progress and outlook in   focus areas Reinforcing management   capital Sustainability   management Corporate governance Data section 79 Fujitsu Integrated Report 2024 Interview with the Chairperson of  the Board of Directors Management Status of corporate governance Risk management Product and service quality Information security  ===== PAGE 81 ===== Major activities of the Independent Directors & Auditors Council The Independent Directors & Auditors Council met eight times in fiscal 2023. The  members continued to discuss, share information, and exchange viewpoints on the  Company’s management direction and important management matters associated  with business restructuring, including M&As by Fujitsu Limited and the Fujitsu Group. Major activities of the Executive Nomination Committee In fiscal 2023, the Executive Nomination Committee met nine times to consider pro­ posals for the nomination of representative directors, including the CEO, as well as  for director and Audit & Supervisory Board member candidates and a proposal for  the nomination of a candidate for chairperson of the Board. The committee also  examined succession plans for the CEO and other executives, considered candidates  for external directors, and carried out mutual evaluations of non-executive directors. Major activities of the Compensation Committee The Compensation Committee met seven times in fiscal 2023 to consider revisions  to the level of compensation for directors, revisions to the details of performance- based compensation for executive directors, and the introduction of stock compen­ sation for non-executive directors. After considering these items, it provided its  findings to the Board of Directors. The committee also examined the amounts of  compensation paid to individual executive directors in the fiscal year. Details of executive compensation in fiscal 2023 The remuneration for directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members for fiscal  2023, as presented in the table below, was determined based on the policy decided in  fiscal 2023, prior to the fiscal 2023 revision to the compensation policy for executive  directors as described in “3. Executive compensation.” Please refer to the following for  the policy for deciding executive compensation before the review.

At this Annual Shareholders’  Meeting, the total amount of non-monetary compensation for executive directors, established separately from the above monetary  compensation, was resolved to be ¥1,200 million or less per year and the total number of shares of common stock of the Company to  be allocated was set within 75,000 shares per year (and within 750,000 shares per year after the 10-for-1 split of its common stock  effective on April 1, 2024). As of the close of the 121st Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, the number of directors was nine (including three  executive directors and five external directors). At the 123rd Annual Shareholders’ Meeting held on June 26, 2023, the total amount of  non-monetary compensation for external directors, established separately from the above monetary compensation, was resolved to be  ¥100 million or less per year and the total number of shares of common stock of the Company to be allocated was set within 6,000  shares per year (and within 60,000 shares per year after the 10-for-1 split of common stock, effective on April 1, 2024). As of the close  of the 123rd Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, the number of external directors was five. The Company is paying the compensation shown  in the above table, which is within these limits. 3. The total amount of compensation for Audit & Supervisory Board members was resolved to be ¥150 million or less per year at the 111th  Annual Shareholders’ Meeting held on June 23, 2011. As of the close of the 111th Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, there were five Audit &  Supervisory Board members (including three external Audit & Supervisory Board members).

Effectiveness of the Board of Directors Systems for ensuring the effectiveness of the Board  of Directors In enhancing the effectiveness of the Board of Directors,  we have focused on creating a system under which non- executive directors function efficiently. Specifically, we  believe that it is essential to establish a system that  enables independent directors and Audit & Supervisory  Board members, who maintain a certain degree of separa­ tion from the execution of business activities, to consis­ tently gain a deeper understanding of the Company’s  business. The Independent Directors & Auditors Council  convenes on multiple occasions each year (eight times in  fiscal 2023), and its members share information and  exchange viewpoints so that each member can formulate  their own opinions. In fiscal 2022, the members continu­ ously engaged in discussions, shared information, and  exchanged views on important management matters,  including the Company’s management direction and  Group business restructuring through M&As and other  activities. Moreover, to facilitate the operation of the  Independent Directors & Auditors Council, we established  the Independent Directors & Auditors Council Support  Office in 2015. Under this system, one junior employee is  assigned to support each council member so that they  are able to acquire information through the support of  these employees without requiring the mediation of the  management execution team. Evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board of Directors To maintain and improve the effectiveness of the Board of  Directors, our Corporate Governance Policy stipulates that  an evaluation of the Board is to be conducted every year.  The Legal Division, which serves as the administrative  office for the Board of Directors, conducts this evaluation  after consulting with the chairperson and then compiles  and summarizes the results. Status of corporate governance Actions taken  in fiscal 2023  based on  fiscal 2022  evaluation In fiscal 2023, from the viewpoint of effective oversight and discussions by the Board of Directors, the Group continued with  the following initiatives with the aim of sharing information in advance with independent directors and auditors to facilitate  the review of high-priority items at Board of Directors meetings, and to enhance substantial communication among Board  members (directors and auditors): meetings of (1) the Independent Directors & Auditors Council and (2) private sessions for  non-executive directors were held to provide them with a platform to enhance communication among themselves. Also,  briefing sessions were held during which the executive officers in charge of each business group shared the progress of ini­ tiatives for business strategies and the Medium-Term Management Plan with independent external directors. In doing so, we  were able to provide information with greater clarity concerning the progress of the action plans of each business unit. 	 From the perspective of meeting management, we exhaustively implemented several measures necessary for enhancing  the quality of discussions on the day of Board meetings: (1) we formed a task force consisting of some Board members to stan­ dardize the proposal document format, making it more concise, easy to read, and ensuring it contains the necessary information  for Board discussions; (2) we established and enforced rules for the distribution of agenda item materials in advance to ensure  that meetings run smoothly and efficiently; and (3) we compiled a glossary of in-house and technical terms with footnotes and  other annotations to be included for such terms in proposal documents. Moreover, for proposals that require elaborate discus­ sions prior to a Board meeting resolution, we purposefully created separate opportunities via the Independent Directors &  Auditors Council and other meeting bodies so that information could be shared and thoroughly discussed in advance. Fiscal 2023  evaluation  method As in fiscal 2022 and previous years, in fiscal 2023 the members of the Board of Directors were asked to complete a ques­ tionnaire by scoring certain items between one and five. This time, we improved usability by having respondents complete  the questionnaire through a survey tool, and further devised a way to efficiently perform quantitative analyses of the results  by adding questions to which respondents must either assign a score or write their own response. In addition, by interview­ ing each respondent based on their responses, we were able to accurately gauge individual concerns and gather feedback  on new initiatives described above that could not be readily discerned from quantitative scores and free-form comments  alone. This approach enabled us to carry out qualitative analyses as the basis for considering meaningful action to take  going forward. The questionnaire included an evaluation of the chairperson and self-evaluations by directors and Audit &  Supervisory Board members, and also asked questions about agenda items, materials, information sharing tools, and how  Board meetings are managed. The results of the Board of Directors effectiveness evaluation were reported and discussed  at regular Board of Directors meetings. Results of an evaluation of the Board by a proxy advisory firm were also reported. Fiscal 2023  evaluation  results Where possible, we compared this year’s results with questionnaire responses over the past five years and made the follow­ ing assessments: • In quantitative responses, the overall average of evaluation points was higher than the previous fiscal year. In particular, we  saw increases in (1) effective monitoring of business strategy decisions and business execution, and (2) prior distribution of  agenda item materials. However, based on requests for further improvement obtained from qualitative free-form comments  and interviews, we intend to implement the following measures: (1) share the summaries of scheduled agenda items as early  as possible and reduce the volume of agenda item materials; and (2) enhance explanations about matters that are to be regu­ larly monitored by the Board (through not only the provision of materials but oral updates at Board meetings), expand oppor­ tunities for discussion, and provide better descriptions in agenda item materials (clarifying key points for discussion, etc.). • Based on the quantitative and qualitative results of the evaluation, we received numerous requests from the Board mem­ bers in fiscal 2023 calling for improvements in the infrastructure used to share agenda item materials. We will therefore  consider making further improvements to both the hardware and the services we use for sharing information. • To strengthen the oversight function of the Board of Directors, we will further streamline meeting proceedings to ensure suf­ ficient time for discussion of important proposals. We will also brush up descriptions in agenda item materials, ensure distribu­ tion well in advance of meetings, and endeavor to elevate the quality of Board discussions by further expanding opportunities  to provide information, including via the Independent Directors & Auditors Council and business briefing sessions. • Given the many specific opinions in evaluation results concerning matters that the Board should receive regular reports  on, as well as matters that should be exhaustively discussed from a longer-term perspective, we will investigate the set­ ting and timing of meeting agendas so as to better facilitate discussion. 	 It is also worth mentioning that the Group’s independent external directors have assessed the discussions of the Board  to be extremely lively and substantial compared to those of other companies.

Uncertainties that might  affect the achievement of these objectives are considered to be risks. To address  these risks, the Fujitsu Group established a Risk Management & Compliance  Committee based on the Policy on the Internal Control System determined by the  Board of Directors. The Committee reports directly to the Board of Directors and  oversees risk management and compliance for the entire Fujitsu Group. 	 The Risk Management & Compliance Committee is chaired by the CEO and is  composed of board members. Its primary function is to continually assess and verify  risks that could potentially lead to losses for the Fujitsu Group. The Committee pro­ actively implements measures to control risks identified during the course of busi­ ness operations (potential risk management). Additionally, the Committee regularly  analyzes realized risks to minimize losses, reporting them to the Board of Directors  and working to prevent their recurrence (materialized risk management). 	 The Risk Management & Compliance Committee has established Regional Risk  Management & Compliance Committees in each region that forms part of the global,  region-based business execution structure. These regional committees operate as sub­ committees. The Risk Management & Compliance Committee has deployed Risk  Management & Compliance Officers to business units (first line), as well as to Group com­ panies and regions, both in Japan and overseas. Together, these entities collaborate to  build a structure that promotes risk management and compliance throughout the Group. 	 To further strengthen the Group’s risk management capabilities, the Group has  established the Corporate Risk Management Office (second line), a department which  reports directly to the CEO and is independent of the business divisions. The  Committee’s secretariat function is provided by the Corporate Risk Management  Office and is supervised by the CRMO (Chief Risk Management Officer). The  Secretariat monitors overall risk information, providing rapid and appropriate  responses. In June 2023, the Group appointed a CQO (Chief Quality Officer) to ensure  prompt implementation of corporate policies and support for information security and  system quality, as well as thorough risk management under the CEO’s direction. The  CQO convenes a monthly meeting of the Risk Management & Compliance Committee  to ensure the swift and effective implementation of corporate policies. 	 To check that the risk management and compliance system is functioning prop­ erly, the Group conducts annual audits by corporate auditors, internal audits by audit  departments (third line), and external audits by an auditing firm.

High priority risks Considering the findings from evaluations conducted in the potential risk manage­ ment process and the status of materialized risks, we have chosen to focus on high  priority risks based on their impact on achieving the Group’s business strategies and  goals. Consequently, we have identified the following two important risks as high  priority for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024: 	Security risks 	Deficiencies or flaws in products and services 	 Please refer to risk management for detailed information on important risks of  the Group.  Security risks  Risks of natural disasters and unforeseen  incidents  Compliance risks  Financial risks  Intellectual property risks  Risks related to environment and climate  change  Risks related to suppliers, alliances, etc.  Customer risks  Risks related to competitors and industries  Deficiencies or flaws in products and  services  Risks related to public regulations, public  policy, and tax matters  Risks related to human resources  Human rights risks  Risks related to economic and financial  market trends  Risks related to investment decisions and  business restructuring  Risks related to the Fujitsu Group facilities  and systems Important risks of the Group Risk management Risk management process Fujitsu Group overview   and management policy Management strategy Financial strategy and   business overview Progress and outlook in   focus areas Reinforcing management   capital Sustainability   management Corporate governance Data section 83 Fujitsu Integrated Report 2024 Interview with the Chairperson of  the Board of Directors Management Status of corporate governance Risk management Product and service quality Information security  ===== PAGE 85 ===== Product and service quality Our quality management structure The Fujitsu Group appointed a CQO (Chief Quality Officer) in June 2023 in an effort  to enhance the quality of our products/services across the entire Group. 	 Furthermore, Fujitsu established Quality Management Representatives (QMRs) in each  business group and Group company to govern Groupwide quality management under  the leadership of the CQO. Following the decision and direction of the CQO, the Global  Quality Management and Assurance Unit formulates common policies, standardization,  and quality improvement mea­ sures as the headquarters of  quality. By deploying these  common measures through  QMRs, with close collaboration,  we strive toward more field-ori­ ented implementation and qual­ ity management in an effort to  provide products/services with  consistent and optimal quality  for our customers. Quality governance Under the CQO, we are working to strengthen quality governance across the Fujitsu  Group as well as prevent major incidents from reoccurring and enhancing the quality  of products/services. 	 The process of strengthening quality governance involves rolling out a common  platform to assess quality risk and the quality assurance process that supports ser­ vice delivery within the Fujitsu Group to correctly assess risks and take thorough  action against it. 	 As the number of challenges in new areas of business increases and information  systems become more complex, we use these mechanisms as a base to make swift  and appropriate decisions and prepare for a variety of risks. Strengthening the design and operation platform supporting quality governance  and risk monitoring We will consolidate quality-related infor­ mation that we obtain in the develop­ ment field, such as progress of  development projects, test density, and  defect detection rate, onto our common  platform, the Fujitsu Developers Platform.  By combining this information with  earned value management (EVM) and  quality indicators and conducting timely  analysis, we will build a mechanism for assessing the quality and delivery decisions in  the development field in a more objective manner. Quality assurance process that supports service delivery To provide customers with higher value than ever before and ensure stable system  operation, we are moving to the “One Delivery” project structure—a new type of  service delivery that is not organization-dependent. One Delivery manages projects  in accordance with the shared “One Delivery Quality Assurance Process” to enable  centralized risk management. 	 The One Delivery Quality Assurance Process embodies four key steps based on  past quality issue trends. First, resource management aims to prevent skills mismatch  and similar problems. Next, the GOGI approval system determines the promotion of  business opportunities and projects from  an objective and multifaceted perspec­ tive. Technology control then aims to  improve technological appropriateness  and feasibility. Finally, through business  opportunity and quality monitoring, we  detect at an early stage those projects  with potential troubles.

Management structure With the rapid increase in more complex and sophisticated cyberattacks, strength­ ening information security has become a top priority for national economic security  and for corporate business activities. In order to further strengthen and ensure the  effectiveness of our information security policies, we believe is it necessary more  than ever to take prompt and appropriate actions under the leadership of senior  management. Therefore, we have enhanced the structure and functions of the Risk  Management & Compliance Committee, chaired by the CEO, where critical risks and  compliance issues in the Group are discussed, to enable continuous, Groupwide  cybersecurity controls. 	 In parallel with the security controls by the Risk Management & Compliance  Committee, monthly regular meeting on quality and security measures have been  established as a venues for discussing countermeasures involving the CEO, CISO,  CRMO (Chief Risk Management Officer), CQO (Chief Quality Officer), and the heads  of business groups to share the status of information security and strengthen mea­ sures according to the given status, thereby ensuring CEO-led risk management. 	 The CISO governance structure includes regional CISOs in Japan and three inter­ national regions (the Americas, Asia Pacific, and Europe) to strengthen information  security through a globally integrated structure by aligning headquarters policies  with the security requirement specific to each country. For Fujitsu and Group com­ panies in Japan and international regions, information security managers have been  assigned to strengthen autonomous information security in each organization, and a  governance structure has been established to reinforce the leadership by the CISO. 	 Specifically, our security manager system ensures that each department has an  Information Manager, who oversees the management and protection of information;  a System Security Manager, who supervises the maintenance and management of  the information security system; and a Product Security Incident Response Team  (PSIRT) Manager, who leads product vulnerability management, so that they can  promote various information security measures in cooperation with the CISO. Our goals for information security Our goal is to achieve information security to provide secure services to our custom­ ers through appropriate risk control by planning/executing proactive security strate­ gies and initiatives based on security life cycle management. 	 To achieve this goal, we are committed to “respond to cyberattacks with ever- evolving advanced information security,” and to “improve the awareness of each  employee and reform our organizational culture,” which are the keys to success. The  entire Group is united in the efforts to develop processes, rules, and methods to pro­ mote cybersecurity practices, and to strengthen information security for the entire  Group, while ensuring a safe environment for its customers and partner companies.

Information management methods  based on the Fujitsu Group Standards for Information Security Measures are applied  to each organization and information system through the execution of the series of  processes outlined in the Risk Management Framework. We strive to achieve effec­ tive implementation of security measures and to realize “security by design” through  a process of continuous improvement. *1 CSF: Cybersecurity Framework *2 SP 800-53: NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations *3 SP 800-37: NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 2 Risk Management Framework Autonomous risk remediation through centralized and visualized IT asset  management To support our customers’ safe, secure, and sustainable business activities, we have  centralized and visualized the IT asset management of our global IT systems for our  customers around the world, as well as our internal IT systems. This helps us  promptly identify and mitigate any security risks throughout the Group. In addition  to the effort of strengthening risk management throughout normal operations, risk  audits are conducted by the CISO organization. The results of the audit are disclosed  and visualized for each department to be aware of their security conditions and to  encourage them to take autonomous remedial action. Vulnerability detection and remediation By providing vulnerability scanning process for systems (assets) directly accessible  from the Internet using IT asset management information, each department that  manages the systems can autonomously conduct periodic scanning and implement  remedial solutions triggered by vulnerability detection. Annual inspections using this  process are conducted to ensure that vulnerability remediation practices are in  place, and when high-risk vulnerabilities are detected, reliable solutions will be  implemented in a timely manner with the involvement of the CISO organization. Information management The Group implemented the Information Protection Management System in order to  appropriately protect third-party confidential information, including personal infor­ mation, as well as our own confidential information, applying a PDCA cycle to infor­ mation management. In order to clarify information assets that must be protected,  we establish suitable information management practices according to the circum­ stances of our customers and business partners, and take stringent measures to pro­ tect information. These measures are taken for the autonomous information  protection activities (regulations by industry, business type, etc.) conducted by each  department, while unifying the classification of information on a global scale. 	 In addition, along with the operation of the Information Protection Management  System, we have developed and launched a storage service that systematically  checks the status of information management (e.g., information classification, grant­ ing of appropriate access rights). When deficiencies in information management are  detected, managers in each department are notified, allowing immediate remedia­ tion to ensure appropriate information management conditions. 	 Meanwhile, Fujitsu has established a global Personal Information Protection  System to strengthen the protection of personal data. Under the leadership of the  CISO organization and the Legal Division, we work with each region and Group com­ pany to comply with the local laws and regulations of each country, including the  GDPR.*4 Privacy policy is available on the public websites of each country, describing  our policy on handling personal information. *4 GDPR: General Data Protection Regulation For more details, see information security Global IT asset management Fujitsu Group overview   and management policy Management strategy Financial strategy and   business overview Progress and outlook in   focus areas Reinforcing management   capital Sustainability   management Corporate governance Data section 86 Fujitsu Integrated Report 2024 Interview with the Chairperson of  the Board of Directors Management Status of corporate governance Risk management Product and service quality Information security  ===== PAGE 88 ===== Profit attributable to owners of the parent Profit attributable to owners of the parent came to ¥254.4 bil­ lion, a record high for the second consecutive year. This is pri­ marily due to the impact of lower tax expenses after  recognizing deferred tax assets in connection with the restruc­ turing of our corporate structure in Europe, despite the booking  of one-off losses arising from the expansion of structural  reforms centered on business in Regions (International). Free cash flow Cash flows from operating activities increased from the previous  fiscal year due to progress made on reducing inventories and  collecting accounts receivable, while cash flows from investing  activities increased, mainly from the acquisition of GK Software.  As a result, free cash flow declined.

While more  organizations are taking action, a frustratingly large number  are yet to see the results they want.  Our 2024 Fujitsu SX Survey reveals that a pioneering  group of organizations (11% of the total respondent base)  is using data-centric collaboration to benefit the planet  while also creating new value. This report shows how other  organizations can follow in their footsteps. 2  ===== PAGE 3 ===== Executive summary	 4  Section 1	 6 A mixed picture on sustainability:  high urgency, but slow progress Section 2	 15 Finding a way to new value: introducing the  sustainability Change Makers Section 3	 28 Charting a course to data-driven collaboration:  the heart of the Change Makers’ approach Section 4	 39 The four steps to becoming a Change Maker Section 5	 44 How Fujitsu can help  ===== PAGE 4 ===== Executive summary In the face of climate change, growing inequality  and economic uncertainty, Sustainability  Transformation (SX) has never been a more  prominent topic of discussion in business circles.  In light of this, from November to December  2023 we surveyed 600 C-level executives  across 15 countries and 11 industries to chart  the sustainability progress being made by  organizations across the globe. Our survey data reveals that in comparison to  last year the majority of executives (53%) feel  they are under more pressure to improve their  business’ sustainability levels. As such, it’s clear that the “sustainability gap” that  we uncovered in last year’s survey – between the  perceived importance of SX and actual progress  made – is closing. Yet in many cases, organizations still struggle  to translate enthusiasm into real results. Of  the executives surveyed, 70% agree that  sustainability is now their top business priority;  this is 13 percentage points higher than last year.  Despite this recognition, only a small minority  (26%) of organizations report tangible outcomes  from their sustainability strategies.  Despite the gravity of these findings, there  are reasons to remain hopeful. Last year, our  research identified a small group of leading  organizations that had made much more  significant progress with SX than had their  mainstream peers. These “Change Makers” offer  a blueprint for other organizations to follow.  This year, we have redefined the Change Maker  group using an even more comprehensive set  of criteria. Consequently, those that qualify  are outperforming their peers in a number of  key areas.  4  ===== PAGE 5 ===== The research findings support our belief that a  cross-industry, data-led approach to sustainability  could help our planet find its way to a brighter  future, with a newfound harmony that promotes  social and corporate prosperity. Over the following pages, we explore what it  really means to be a Change Maker. You will  also find a set of recommendations based  on the Change Makers’ approach, to help  your organization chart its course to faster  SX progress. Key findings from the  2024 research The majority (70%) of executives say SX is a  top priority, but only 26% of organizations  report tangible results from their sustainability  strategies. This disparity even applies to “high- priority” initiatives. For example, almost half (48%)  of executives see tackling climate change as a  high priority, yet only 17% have achieved tangible  outcomes from their efforts in this respect. 81% of Change Makers have delivered tangible  results from their sustainability strategies  to date, which is more than four times the  proportion generated by other organizations.  Change Makers take a long-term view as they  understand that prioritizing SX also means  driving business growth. These are harmonious  ambitions, not conflicting ones. Change Makers  are more likely than their peers to report  increased revenue and profitability over the past  12 months. Change Makers take a mature approach to data.  Change Maker organizations are far more likely to  have achieved the highest level of data maturity,  defined as the ability to gather and analyze data  from multiple sources, and use it to supercharge  sustainability efforts. For instance, 44% of  Change Makers say they use interconnected data,  combined with advanced technology, to simulate  and predict future scenarios, supporting efficient  decision-making processes, compared with just  12% of other organizations. Change Makers collaborate with other  organizations on SX. Change Makers are 17  percentage points more likely than other  organizations to work with partners both within  their own industry and across other industries.  Crucially, one-quarter of Change Makers  participate in highly collaborative ecosystems,  enabling them to share resources and data, and  to create shared value around sustainability. Only  6% of other organizations have achieved this. 5  ===== PAGE 6 ===== Section 1 A mixed picture on  sustainability: high urgency,  but slow progress 6  ===== PAGE 7 ===== Changes in sentiment  2023 57% 2024 70% 2023 23% 2024 45% Sustainability is our top  priority for the next  five years Our performance tracks  below external  sustainability targets Base sample: 2023 - 1000 | 2024 - 600  Although appetite for SX is growing,  our research shows that only a  minority of organizations (26%) are  reporting tangible results from their  sustainability strategies.  The global sustainability gap has reached a  tipping point.  Last year, 61% of executives told us their  organizations were “advanced” on their  sustainability journey. However, fewer than  one in 10 had completed major sustainability  imperatives. Despite their sluggish progress,  more than half (57%) of executives said their  organization was “exceeding expectations” at  meeting external sustainability goals. Enthusiasm  for sustainability was evidently running high but  organizations had low awareness in terms of their  actual progress. This year, the research reveals a deeper  understanding among survey respondents. The  C-suite executives we surveyed most recently  are 13 percentage point more likely to report that  sustainability is their top business priority (70%  overall say this). Almost half (45%) believe their  organization’s performance is failing to meet  external sustainability targets – almost double  the proportion that said the same last year.  Considered together, these insights suggest that  businesses around the globe are waking up to  the scale of the sustainability challenge. Blind  optimism is being replaced by a sense of urgency  – more than half of the executives in our latest  survey (53%) say they feel more pressure to move  toward sustainability than they did last year. Figure 1: Urgency around sustainability has increased.	   Executives report an increasing sense of urgency regarding SX – but they are less optimistic about their performance compared 		   with last year. 7  ===== PAGE 8 ===== of executives surveyed are  not achieving outcomes from  sustainability strategies. Organizations are failing to  deliver the desired results on the  sustainability initiatives that matter Despite the urgency around SX, less than  half of the executives in our sample say  their organization has implemented a  sustainability strategy (42%). And only a  small percentage (26%) of organizations are  delivering tangible outcomes from these  strategies. This sluggish pace is reflected in  the 14 initiatives that are critical to making  meaningful sustainability progress (as set  out in Figure 2 on page 11). 8  ===== PAGE 9 ===== Planet, Prosperity and People: The three pillars of  Sustainability Transformation In this report, we define SX as adapting your  organization through digital innovation to  drive positive, lasting change for our globe’s  environment and its increasingly digitized  society. It’s about aligning business growth  and sustainability as a way of ensuring long- term prosperity.  We believe 14 key initiatives (as seen on  the following page) drive SX. These can be  grouped under three pillars: Planet: Reducing the harm  caused to the planet, and  driving regeneration.  Prosperity: Building a  more prosperous, inclusive  digital society.  People: Enhancing health  and wellbeing globally. 9  ===== PAGE 10 ===== The 14 key sustainability initiatives 1.	 Tackling climate change  2.	 Recycling resources  3.

Despite some fluctuations, there have  been minimal tangible outcomes in all  14 areas. The projects focused on Planet  initiatives are proving the most problematic  to progress in this respect. The initiatives  under the Prosperity pillar were most likely  to generate positive outcomes overall.  The programs that perform most strongly  are: improving customer experiences,  promoting healthy workplace environments,  addressing labor shortages, and ensuring  data security. All of these have the common  intention of nurturing the wellbeing of  immediate stakeholders. Arguably, all also  have the scope to yield direct commercial  benefits more quickly than, say, the Planet- focused sustainability initiatives. Figure 2: Few organizations are creating tangible sustainability outcomes. Only a small percentage of organizations are making  meaningful progress on 14 key initiatives across the three sustainability pillars of Planet, Prosperity and People.  11  ===== PAGE 12 ===== Priority vs progress for the 14 initiatives   Planet Prosperity People % generating tangible outcomes (progress) % of execs rating initiative as high-priority  25% 20% 15% 10% 5% 60% 55% 50% 45% 40% 35% 30% 25% Recycling resources Biodiversity Climate change Digital divide Healthy workplace IT/AI ethics Responsible supply chains Human rights causes Reskilling Employee & customer healthcare Preserving water Reducing waste Improving CX  Data security Base sample: 600  Figure 3 indicates that, despite a strong  commitment to sustainability, translating  enthusiasm for sustainability into  tangible outcomes remains a challenge.  Organizations are dedicating time and  effort to enhancing customer experience,  promoting healthcare for employees  and customers, and addressing climate  change. Yet even efforts towards these  top priorities frequently do not lead to  impactful results, mirroring the challenges  faced in other domains. Figure 3: Prioritization does not guarantee outcome. Although organizations are highly	   prioritizing certain sustainability initiatives, very few are seeing tangible results. 12  ===== PAGE 13 ===== Execs per industry reporting outcomes from the 14 initiatives Prosperity Planet People Energy Planet Prosperity People 49% 29% 29% Manufacturing Planet Prosperity People 27% 26% 20% Public sector  Planet Prosperity People 37% 50% 47% Retail Planet Prosperity People 27% 44% 37% Financial services Planet Prosperity People 22% 37% 29% Technology and telecoms Planet Prosperity People 15% 30% 26% Healthcare Planet Prosperity People 27% 29% 28% Media Planet Prosperity People 12% 20% 19% Life science Planet Prosperity People 28% 29% 36% Transport and mobility Planet Prosperity People 23% 33% 34%  Building and construction Planet Prosperity People 6% 22% 25% Base sample: 600 Industry lens Figure 4 reveals that the energy and  utilities and public sectors are most likely  to achieve sustainability outcomes, with  the energy sector particularly excelling in  Planet-focused projects. Meanwhile, the  public sector excels in achieving outcomes  in Prosperity and People initiatives. However, despite making the strongest  progress, the public and energy sectors  were most inclined to report that their  performance lagged external benchmarks.  This is not unexpected, given the nature  of these industries. They place significant  importance on external evaluations that  assess the impact their actions have on  their focus areas. Consequently, they  face immense pressure to implement  sustainable changes.  Figure 4: The public and energy sectors are leading by example. The public sector is the most likely to produce tangible outcomes across  the People and Prosperity pillars. The energy sector is the most successful at Planet initiatives.  13  ===== PAGE 14 ===== Execs per industry reporting their org is behind external  sustainability targets 60% Public sector 55% Energy 54% Transport and mobility  52% Media 50% Building and construction  50% Technology and telecoms  41% Financial services 41% Healthcare 36% Life sciences  35% Retail 25% Manufacturing  Base sample: 600  Figure 5: Executives in the energy and public sectors have their eyes wide open to the urgency of sustainability.

Central to  their success is a mature approach to  defining value. Despite slow progress on sustainability  overall, our data also uncovered a small group  that reports much stronger sustainability  performance, delivering tangible outcomes in the  14 key sustainability initiatives.  We call these leading organizations the “Change  Makers.” They account for 11% of the total  research sample and originate from 13 countries  and 11 sectors. Executives from Germany  contribute the biggest share of Change Makers  (24%), followed by Finland, Singapore and Spain.  Of the 11 sectors, the energy and healthcare  sectors have the highest percentages of  Change Makers. 16  ===== PAGE 17 ===== % of orgs per country that are  Change Makers Germany 24% Finland 23% Singapore 17% Spain 17% US 12% UK 10% China 7% Korea 7% Philippines 7% Thailand 7% Australia 6% Canada 4% France 3% Base sample: 600  % of orgs per industry that are Change Makers 17% Energy 13% Healthcare 11% Financial services 11% Manufacturing  11% Retail 10% Public sector  8% Building and construction  6% Technology and telecoms  5% Life sciences  5% Media 3% Transport and mobility  Base sample: 600  Who are the Change Makers?

Change	 Makers are far more likely than other organizations to say they  are exceeding expectations in performance against external	 sustainability targets. Figure 9: Change Makers are well ahead of mainstream organizations. Change Maker organizations are those organizations  that have made the greatest progress on the 14 key sustainability initiatives. 18  ===== PAGE 19 ===== The vast majority of Change Makers (81%) have  already achieved tangible results from their  sustainability strategies to date, compared with  19% of the general sample. 100% of Change  Makers are confident they will meet their  sustainability objectives on time. In contrast, only  62% of organizations in the mainstream group  feel the same.  Where stronger sustainability progress has been  achieved, it appears to translate into superior  overall business performance. Change Makers  are far more likely than other organizations to  report that profit, share price and market share  have increased over the past 12 months. They are  also far more likely to say that their sustainability  initiatives have contributed directly to revenue  and profit growth (65% versus 48%). These trends  demonstrate a correlation between SX and  business results.  Summarizing their performance against external  sustainability targets, the majority of Change  Makers (70%) indicate that they are exceeding  expectations, whereas only 18%, as seen in  Figure 8, of mainstream organizations have this  level of confidence in their progress.  Across the 14 sustainability initiatives measured  in our survey, a significant proportion of Change  Makers (41%), on average, have already achieved  tangible results, as seen in Figure 9. In contrast,  only 13% of the mainstream group, on average,  have done so. For instance, 42% of Change  Makers have managed to achieve tangible  outcomes for the Planet initiative of tackling  climate change, while only 14% of mainstream  organizations can say the same.  19  ===== PAGE 20 ===== Case study New value creation through sustainable innovation  In East Africa, Diageo has introduced using biomass as fuel to build business resilience and  overcome the challenge of a volatile exchange rate which affects fossil fuels. “We’re using waste products from the local agricultural supply chain to power our facilities,” says  Kate Gibson. “That’s giving local farmers an extra source of income, it’s removing the volatility and  the exchange rate challenge using fossil fuels, and it’s also delivering significant carbon emission  reductions for our business.”  Diageo has already reaped the benefits from this initiative. “This isn’t an investment that will pay us  back in five years’ time, it’s already delivered in year one.” Kate Gibson Global ESG Director Diageo 20  ===== PAGE 21 ===== Case study Creating new value and sharing it with market peers Colgate-Palmolive is not ignorant of how plastic packaging can impact the environment. According to the  company’s Chief Sustainability Officer, Ann Tracy, the world uses around 20 billion tubes of toothpaste a year. As a leader in the oral-hygiene industry, the company tackled this issue head on by developing a first-of- its-kind recyclable toothpaste tube. The tube is primarily made from high density polyethylene (HDPE),  #2 plastic. Colgate-Palmolive’s goal is to transition its tubes globally by 2025 and, as of December 31,  2023, approximately 90% of the company’s toothpaste SKUs in North America have transitioned. During  this transition phase, communities may not yet accept tubes for recycling. Consumers should check with  their local community programs. Colgate decided to make the technology and approach public - and to date, has shared its tube  information at approximately 80 sessions with third parties, including competitors, to encourage  recyclability of all tubes in practice and at scale. Building on this momentum, Tracy says that “pleasingly, all major toothpaste manufacturers have publicly  committed to transition their tube portfolios by 2025.” Ann Tracy Chief Sustainability Officer Colgate-Palmolive 21  ===== PAGE 22 ===== Change Maker characteristics:  What sets the leaders apart?  To emulate the Change Makers’ success,  mainstream organizations must embrace the  standards set by these sustainability leaders. Our  research reveals that Change Makers demonstrate  two defining characteristics: a focus on creating  long-term value through sustainability; and the  ability to form data-centric collaborations with  partners both within and across industries.  The Change Maker paradox:  How a long-term view that  looks beyond competition can  unlock competitive advantage Unlike the majority of the executives surveyed,  those in Change Maker organizations were far  more likely to have mature, holistic motivations  driving their sustainability efforts. In short,  Change Makers follow a new approach to  creating value: one that looks beyond self-serving  financial rewards to the positive impact that  the organization can make on the planet and on  society. Profit is no longer the primary imperative. This long-term, mature outlook allows Change  Makers to overcome the toughest barriers  blocking sustainability progress. These concerns  are the high investment costs and poor ROI of  sustainability projects.  These are natural concerns for businesses  in general, many of which remain primarily  focused on financial growth and stability.  But organizations should not let short-sighted  financial motivations direct their sustainability  efforts. Organizations that take a long-term,  holistic approach to SX are more likely to report  improved financial performance, and to agree  that their sustainability initiatives are directly  linked to business growth. We have dubbed this  phenomenon “the Change Maker paradox.” 22  ===== PAGE 23 ===== Top drivers for sustainability initiatives Change Makers The rest Strengthening brand image 63% 46% Making a positive societal impact  60% 47% Reducing our impact on the planet 54% 44% Driving business growth 52% 50% Attracting investment 52% 51% Improving customer loyalty 51% 47% Increasing transparency  51% 48% Improving job satisfaction 51% 43% Improving employee wellbeing 44% 48% Developing new revenue streams 38% 49% Strengthening corporate governance 35% 35% Base sample: Change Makers=63; The rest=537 Figure 10: Sustainability leaders focus on the greater good. Change Makers are more likely than other organizations to say their  sustainability initiatives are motivated by a desire to make a positive impact on the environment and on society. 23  ===== PAGE 24 ===== The business and sustainability  effort have to come as one  and remain inseparable. What  we mean by the integration  of sustainability and business  management is that we genuinely  want to approach this on an  entire value chain basis, so that  we provide a positive impact  to society at large. This will of  course also contribute to our  business. So thereby we will not  only be able to enhance our  corporate value, but we will be  able to provide positive value to  the society as well. Kayoko Kondo Director and Executive Officer Asahi Soft Drinks Co., Ltd. Colgate-Palmolive puts success metrics in place,  often based on intangible benefits for their  sustainability initiatives, rather than return on  investment targets. “What value means is a question we are discussing  right now,” says Tracy. “Because there are many  intangible successes whose impacts are harder to  measure, such as employee pride.” “One of the key themes we are discussing: How do  we establish value behind sustainability? Because  the perception is – and, in some cases, it’s real – that,  when you first design a more sustainable product,  it can be more expensive to make. However, we can  reduce costs when we scale these products and we  know that consumers want to buy more sustainable  products which helps to drive growth.” Ann Tracy Chief Sustainability Officer Colgate-Palmolive 24  ===== PAGE 25 ===== Execs that have seen SX  boost revenues Change Makers 65% The rest 48% Base sample: Change Makers=63; The rest=537 Organizations in general focus on the financial  benefits of greater sustainability. The top  motivation of the mainstream sample is to  use sustainability initiatives to attract new  investment. Change Makers, in contrast, are  primarily motivated by the opportunity to have  a positive impact on society and the planet.  Looking at their top three motivations, the  majority of Change Makers (60%) focus on  having a positive impact on society, and reducing  impact on the planet (54%). These two primary  motivations link to the very strongest driver for  Change Makers: strengthening brand reputation.  Positive brand recognition will be a natural by- product of genuine dedication to improving the  environment and society overall. And it appears that this holistic approach to  delivering value through sustainability is giving  Change Makers an advantage. As seen in figure 12  on next page, across all the metrics we examined,  Change Makers were more likely than other  organizations to have seen growth over the past  12 months. On average, Change Makers are  15 percentage points more likely than executives  in non-Change Maker organizations (who are less  likely to be motivated by sustainable outcomes)  to report that profit, share price and market share  have increased over the past 12 months.  What does this mean for businesses that are  struggling to make progress with sustainability  initiatives? The data suggests that placing  sustainability at the heart of the business  strategy isn’t just an ethical decision, it also  makes good business sense. Contributing to the  greater good and boosting financial performance  are not opposing forces, but harmonious ones. Figure 1 1 : Change Makers are intentional about SX.

Our research also indicates that the ability to  collaborate with partners across industries,  underpinned by a mature approach to data, is  supercharging Change Makers’ SX progress. Organizations must learn from the Change  Makers, and form bonds of trust and mutual  dependence with other organizations. As we will  see in the next chapter, data-centric collaborative  efforts are essential to creating new value. We’ve realized that our sustainability projects would be more  successful if we put more effort into getting the data flowing  from one organization to another, as it would help us make  better decisions. Markus Kühn Chief Strategy Officer City of Helsinki 27  ===== PAGE 28 ===== Section 3 Charting a course to  data-driven collaboration:  the heart of the Change  Makers’ approach 28  ===== PAGE 29 ===== of Change Makers say their  ability to unlock insights  from data is vital to achieving sustainability objectives Weak collaboration across industries,  exacerbated by flawed data strategies,  is a critical barrier to sustainability  progress. But Change Makers are using  data to their advantage.  Almost 75% of Change Makers are using data to  inform their SX decisions across the board and  just under 80% are using data to enhance the  performance of their sustainability partnerships.  Our analysis indicates that the Change Makers  have managed to excel in two areas where their  competitors are struggling: •	 Using data in a mature way to inform SX •	 Engaging in data-centric partnerships with  other organizations  Data maturity: The  lifeblood of successful  Sustainability Transformation  As expected, Change Makers are more likely to  report a high level of data maturity than are other  organizations. In fact, almost half of Change  Makers have achieved the highest level of data  maturity, in terms of both of how they use data  within their own organizations (44%), and how  they use it to collaborate with partners (49%).  In contrast, most organizations struggle to reach  advanced levels of data maturity. The majority  of the mainstream sample (55%) fail to use  connected data to inform decision-making in  their sustainability projects. This is consistent  with trends observed in last year’s research:  a significant portion of executives (between 87%  and 48%) were not using sustainability metrics  actively to track the success of the sustainability  initiatives we analyzed. Moreover, this year almost  half of respondents (43%) say the sustainability  data required for their initiatives is absent,  while 45% say they struggle to utilize the data  that is available. These and other challenges are  holding back the data maturity of organizations.  29  ===== PAGE 30 ===== Orgs at each maturity level  of using sustainability  data internally  Change Makers The rest Level 0 2% 4% Level 1 6% 25% Level 2 17% 26% Level 3 30% 32% Level 4 44% 12% Base sample: Change Makers=63; The rest=537 Use of data internally The five maturity levels of using sustainability data internally  (across an organization) Level 0 Organization lacks a coordinated approach to  collecting and managing data pertaining to its  own sustainability initiatives, or the data itself  does not exist.

Level 3 Organization is using a variety of connected data,  and visualizing and utilizing  this data to make decisions that improve  efficiency, productivity and other business value  at a basic level. Level 4 Organization is using interconnected  data and advanced technology to create  predictive scenarios, strengthening decision- making processes. Figure 13: Change Makers are more advanced in using their own sustainability data. Change Maker organizations are more than	  three times as likely as other organizations to have achieved the	  highest level of data maturity. 30  ===== PAGE 31 ===== Organizations at Level 4, the highest tier of  maturity, are benefitting greatly from removing  their data silos and connecting multiple data  sources. And, with the help of advanced  technologies, these coordinated approaches to  managing sustainability data not only provide  visibility into how initiatives are currently  performing, but can also allow business leaders  to forecast future events.  For instance, Internet of Things (IoT) technology  is helping a Czechia-based brewery to navigate  the potential impact of climate change on  its business.  Plzeňský Prazdroj harnesses data insights from  IoT sensors attached to the hops used in beer  production, in collaboration with Asahi Group  and other external partners. Data on current  hop health, coupled with rain forecast data and  other predictions on temperature fluctuations,  helps farmers decide on how to best care for the  hops to ensure optimal growth.These insights can  even help preserve hop yields during drought  conditions, which are occurring more frequently  due to climate change. Kayoko Kondo, Director  and Executive Officer, Asahi Soft Drinks says:  “Through this project, we have placed the so- called hop ECG sensors directly onto the hop  plants. These sensors provide us with unique  information that tells us what the plants need.  The connected app can predict yield and quality  of hops based on historical data. Farmers can also  enter their target yield and quality of hops, and  the app will tell them what they need to do to  achieve that.”  As seen in the case above, when separate  data sources are connected, organizations can  make smarter decisions as they have a more  detailed view of the various factors at play in  the situation at hand. By having a better view of  the full picture, organizations can make more  well-rounded decisions pertaining to their  sustainability initiatives.   Access to new data sources is a key benefit of  collaborating on sustainability projects.

Stronger together: Data- centric collaboration is vital for  sustainability progress The majority of the Change Makers in our  sample report a high level of collaboration  maturity. In practical terms, sustainability  collaborations involve multiple organizations  pooling resources, and sharing expertise and data  insights. The discoveries generated from working  together can inform organizations’ efforts to  overcome barriers and innovate to achieve their  sustainability goals. Figure 14: Change Makers lean on their partners. Change Maker organizations are more likely to collaborate on sustainability  initiatives than the rest of the sample. 32  ===== PAGE 33 ===== Almost half of the Change Maker group (44%)  have formed strategic partnerships both  within and across industries, while one in four  is operating in highly collaborative ecosystems,  allowing them to create shared value around  sustainability initiatives (versus just 27% and 6%,  respectively, of other organizations). Forming  these ecosystems maximizes societal benefits  while minimizing business risk. Good access to data together with machine learning will  enable our education, healthcare, environment, culture, leisure  and sports sectors to predict their service needs better  without undergoing major organizational transformations.  Doing so can improve the speed and level of decision making  and provide these sectors with better tools for making and  analyzing the impact of their services. That’s where I see the  most potential in the coming years.

Figure 15: Change Makers are putting data at the center of 	  their sustainability partnerships. The relative majority of Change  Makers are at the highest level of maturity when it comes to 	  using data in sustainability partnerships. 34  ===== PAGE 35 ===== As seen in Figure 14 Change Makers are  more likely to be leveraging collaborations.  Sustainability initiatives are often multi-faceted  and require diverse expertise. Cross-industry  partnerships can help access the range of skills,  resources and knowledge required to navigate  sustainability dynamics. The high levels of collaboration and data  maturity displayed by Change Makers, and  public-sector organizations overall, set them  apart. Most organizations struggle to collaborate  on sustainability initiatives – so a rapid increase  in this capability will be vital in order to make an  impact on a global scale. For example, more than  half of executives (51%) cite poor collaboration  among stakeholders as a barrier to SX, while 42%  cite the lack of a clear or shared strategy with  business partners. To accelerate their SX progress, it is essential  that organizations commit to overcoming  collaboration and data challenges. Our research  confirms that organizations involved in data-led  sustainability partnerships make greater progress  Data sharing is absolutely essential for us throughout our supply  and value chain because it is essential in helping us reduce  CO2 emissions with regards to Scope 3. We need our suppliers,  whether that’s packaging or raw materials, to collaborate with  us so that we can all be Scope 3 compliant. Kayoko Kondo Director and Executive Officer  Asahi Soft Drinks Co., Ltd. 35  ===== PAGE 36 ===== on their SX journeys. They are also more likely to  report stronger financial performance. This is due  to the fact that collaboration allows organizations  to draw on each other’s strengths, delivering  more effective outcomes in a shorter time frame.  The most sophisticated data-centric sustainability  collaborations (Level 4) are formed in digitally  driven ecosystems. Such ecosystems involve,  for example, sharing data across the supply  chain to reduce carbon footprint, or to innovate  more sustainable products and services. These  digital ecosystems are built on collaborative  infrastructures that enable the integration,  exchange and analysis of data from multiple  sources. These sources can be locally distributed,  such as partners in a local region or business  network, or globally distributed across industries,  sectors, countries or continents. Digitally enabled  data ecosystems allow organizations to expand  beyond the frontiers of their own organization  and take their efforts to the next level.  The public-private partnership behind the Boeing  Cascade Climate Impact Model is a strong  example of a collaborative digital ecosystem  that creates new value through data sharing.  Boeing works closely with the Cascade User  Community founding members – International  Air Transport Association (IATA), NASA, University  of Cambridge’s Aviation Impact Accelerator  and the MIT Laboratory for Aviation and the  Environment. The Community provides feedback  on new features, functionalities and application  programming interfaces. Cascade is a public, data-sharing tool designed to  help stakeholders in the aerospace industry make  more informed decisions around reducing their  carbon footprints. Organizations can access data  and explore different decarbonization pathways  such as fleet renewal, sustainable aviation fuels,  electric-battery technology as well as understand  the impact of the energy lifecycle. “For instance,  98% of hydrogen today is not green,” says Brian  Moran, Chief Sustainability Officer, The Boeing  Company. “So, if we had hydrogen flights,  36  ===== PAGE 37 ===== Use of sustainability data (level 4) Use of sustainability data within our org Internal Change Makers 44% The rest 12% Sharing sustainability data externally to other orgs External Change Makers 49% The rest 23% Base sample: Change Makers=63; The rest=537 certain questions would arise, such as, ‘What are  the life-cycle emissions of that hydrogen?’ We  created this tool to answer such questions, as  well as share data and perspectives and initiate  discussions with regulators and customers.” A skills gap around utilizing data  internally vs externally  When comparing the maturity of internal and  external data use, an interesting trend emerges  across the organizations surveyed. Overall,  organizations are more likely to be advanced at  sharing sustainability data with external partners  than using their own sustainability data internally.  And, while Change Makers excel in utilizing  internal data, they, too, succumb to this trend. A  likely contributing factor here is the requirements  for carbon tracking through supply chains, which  force organizations to collaborate and share  data with less advanced organizations that are  nevertheless able to learn from the more mature  stakeholders in the chain.  Organizations may be more attracted to  investing in sharing data externally because  there are more significant benefits up for grabs.  Effort and funds expended on sharing siloed  data within an organization are only likely to lead  to greater efficiency and cost reductions. Data  collaboration, however, between organizations  increases data value exponentially through cross- referencing and has more potential to create  new value. For many businesses, achieving high maturity  in collaboration and data use can seem an  impossible challenge. However, as we will see in  the next section, following the blueprint set by  the Change Maker organizations can strengthen  capabilities across these two areas. Figure 16: Organizations are more advanced at sharing	 data externally (with other organizations) than internally  (across their own enterprise). All organizations – including  the Change Makers – seem more adept at using data for	 sustainability efforts across industries, rather than within their own organizations.  37  ===== PAGE 38 ===== Execs per industry reporting their org has advanced maturity in  sharing data with external partners (level 4) Public sector  46% Energy 35% Retail 33% Healthcare 32% Technology and telecoms  27% Financial services  25% Building and construction  24% Transport and mobility  22% Media 18% Manufacturing  18% Life sciences  8% Base sample: 600  Figure 1 7: The public sector is more collaborative than the private sector. Public-sector organizations are most likely to have formed  highly collaborative ecosystems, while life sciences organizations are least likely to have done this. 38  ===== PAGE 39 ===== Section 4 The four steps to becoming  a Change Maker To attain the standards set by the Change Makers, we  recommend that organizations focus on accelerating their  SX journeys by following these four steps 39  ===== PAGE 40 ===== Step 1: Define your organization’s  purpose and set clear goals Develop your purpose and chart a  course towards creating new value. Ask yourself: does your organization have a  purpose that is clearly defined and understood  by every individual within? SX initiatives often  demand considerable investments, yet it’s  evident that Change Makers are managing to  balance organizational growth with sustainability  by focusing on SX with a forward-looking  approach.  The first step to becoming a Change Maker is to  adopt a long-term view of the value derived from  SX. This requires clearly defining your company’s  role, value, and contributions to society to  craft your purpose. It is equally crucial that this  purpose is understood and embraced by every  employee.  Having an organizational purpose focused on  realizing this mission enables setting goals that  extend beyond short-term financial figures  to encompass broader societal value and  contributions. 40  ===== PAGE 41 ===== Step 2: Create and execute an  end-to-end SX strategy Translate purpose into action.  Delivering SX requires you to make plans that  align your purpose and your business goals.  Develop strategies that take you beyond the  short-term business period, that focus on longer- term outcomes like positive impact to the  environment and to society. Identify priorities  that contribute to new value creation and growth. Integrate financial and non-financial  perspectives. An end-to-end SX strategy must consider both  financial impacts and the broader, non-financial  effects of its implementation. Financially, this  entails looking at business domains like IT,  R&D, and human resources, to determine how  these contribute to the business model and the  creation of new value. Non-financial outcomes, such as reduced  environmental footprints, enhanced brand  reputation, and improved well-being for  people should also be targeted. Key non- financial metrics to consider would include  customer satisfaction, employee engagement,  advancement in digital transformation (DX)  initiatives , and reductions in greenhouse gas  (GHG) emissions. Bringing these together into an end-to-end  SX strategy will give you a strong foundation,  allowing you to move in the right direction and  deliver on these goals.  41  ===== PAGE 42 ===== Step 3: Upgrade your own data  maturity (internal)  Harness your organization’s own  data effectively. Organizations must commit to collecting  appropriate, high-quality data. Routine data- hygiene audits are useful to ensure ongoing  integrity. Identifying weak points will allow you  to embed quality-control measures to ensure  data is correctly formatted, standardized and  stored cleanly, and protected with robust cyber  security systems.  Turn insight into action.  Once you have a foundation of reliable data to  build on, you can develop detailed insights into  your business processes. These visualization  exercises can even be enhanced using AI  systems to create simulation models that can  create and test predictive scenarios. The data  insights can then be used to refine processes and  monitor your organization’s progress against its  sustainability goals. This transparency will give  your business leaders more accuracy in adjusting  initiatives as required. Many businesses are  already using simulation models to inform their  decisions related to resource allocation, energy  usage, inventory levels, environmental conditions,  and customer trends.  42  ===== PAGE 43 ===== Step 4: Collaborate with others in  a data-centric way (external)  Participate in data-driven partnerships.  Here is where the hard work you put into  enhancing your own data infrastructure will  be rewarded. By strengthening your own data  practices and data quality, your organization will  be in a position to collaborate with others in a  more sophisticated way. You will enjoy greater  scope for sharing and combining data with your  partners. A rich network of data sources will also  enhance your data-visualization capabilities, so  you can make wiser sustainability decisions.  Follow a clear data framework.  To collaborate in a data-centric way, Change  Makers recommend using a common and clear  data framework. This will provide a metric and  tracking tool for success across the partnership.  43  ===== PAGE 44 ===== Section 5 How Fujitsu can help 44  ===== PAGE 45 ===== As the research shows, Change Makers  demonstrate that contributing to the greater  good and boosting profit needn’t be conflicting  priorities. Rather, they can work together to  create new business value.  At the heart of this approach are data and  collaboration. Digital capabilities, through to the  more sophisticated systems powered by the likes  of AI and quantum computing, are, therefore,  key to enabling sustainability and unlocking  new value.  But, even though most organizations recognize  the importance of sustainability, many are  struggling to make meaningful progress. As  a technology organization, we recognize our  responsibility to help all organizations become  Change Makers in their own right. To do so, we are focusing our efforts on the  three sustainability pillars: Planet, Prosperity and  People. These are areas where Fujitsu Uvance is  applying digital solutions to enable our customers  to achieve tangible results in their sustainability  efforts. The next few pages show some examples  of how we are doing this. 45  ===== PAGE 46 ===== Planet Providing the tools to manage ESG Growing regulatory requirements and calls for  transparency around planet conservation and  climate change have made economic, social and  governance (ESG) management an urgent priority  for organizations. To manage environmental  impact successfully (e.g., by reducing carbon  footprint or reaching net zero targets),  organizations must be able to:  •	 Visualize, analyze, and optimize potential  barriers and risks based on broad cross- organizational data. •	 Develop strategy around managing  environmental impact across partnerships and  supply chains.  Fujitsu Uvance plays a key role in supporting  organizations in their ESG management by  consolidating and centralizing data from various  sources. Centralized data provides a clear, real- time view of potential risks and focus areas. It  also enables organizations to build simulations,  making room for experimentation and improving  decision-making related to Planet initiatives.  Based on data insights and industry expertise,  Fujitsu Uvance also gives recommendations on  how organizations should optimize their ESG  measures to create business models that are  both competitive and environmentally friendly.  Case study Access customer story Township of Barsbüttel Visualizing, analyzing, and improving  energy consumption at public facilities  in Barsbüttel, Germany, to achieve  highest energy efficiency 46  ===== PAGE 47 ===== Prosperity Promoting responsible supply chains Organizations are under pressure to deliver  supply chain transparency and visibility. A new  generation of consumers expects organizations  to source and manufacture products responsibly,  minimizing impact on the environment, and  ensuring they do not exploit their workforce in  any way.  At the same time, growing economic and  geopolitical turmoil in recent years has  exacerbated supply-chain vulnerability. These  factors leave organizations asking:  •	 How can we successfully mitigate the various  risks at play? •	 How can we ensure that our supply-chain  partners meet rising standards?  Fujitsu centrally manages and visualizes data  across the entire supply chain to help simulate  and predict risks such as disasters and changes  in market needs. This is made possible by  connecting and harnessing data across the  ecosystem partners. We then use insights  gleaned from the data to propose the measures  necessary to achieve optimal outcomes.  This intelligence helps organizations cut their  reaction times when problems arise, so they can  intervene quickly and minimize damage to supply  chain integrity. Here, Fujitsu Uvance’s capabilities  with real-time data-sharing help reduce losses  and improve decision-making processes.

Moreover, healthcare  practitioners often find themselves burdened  by administrative tasks when they should be  focusing on treating patients. But, when used in  the right way, digital systems can:  •	 Help individuals and employees access  the care they need to boost quality of life  and wellbeing.  •	 Support healthcare staff by shouldering  administrative tasks and providing analytics  that can fast-track decision-making.  Under an effective data-management regime,  which respects data ownership at all times,  personal data can be aggregated and filtered  to provide recommendations for building the  optimal healthcare system. The goal is to create  a safe and secure society in which people can  live affluent lives by making predictions based on  individual purchase data and proposing products  that are beneficial to their health. In this way, Fujitsu Uvance enables healthcare  organizations to optimize their customer service  through personalized patient experiences.  It also supports healthcare staff through  centralized data processes and the use of AI  visualization tools.

The demographics of the survey sample  are shown below. The survey was carried out over a  four-week period between November to December   2023.   There are representatives from across 11 industries:  building and construction, energy, financial services,  healthcare, manufacturing, life sciences, media,  mobility, public sector, tech and telecoms, and retail.   The entire sample is composed of senior leadership,  with all respondents sitting at C-level. In terms of  the size of the organizations they work for, annual  revenues sit above $500 million.  As well as the survey research, we conducted  one-on-one interviews with a number of senior  executives and experts, whose insights are  featured in this report. Our thanks go to everyone  who contributed. About the Change Makers The Change Makers are the organizations in our  survey that have made the greatest progress in  delivering their SX initiatives. We have isolated  this leader group based on how they respond to  a selection of questions related to SX that were  included in the survey. These qualifying questions  measured level of SX maturity, degree of progress  in the 14 sustainability initiatives, and maturity  of attitudes and mindsets towards sustainability.  Change Makers account for 11% of the total sample. *Rounding to the correct number of decimal places can cause the  total to be slightly different from 100%. 49  ===== PAGE 50 ===== Countries US 25% Australia 8% Canada 8% Germany 8% UK 8% France 7% China 5% Finland 5% Japan 5% Singapore 5% Spain 5% Korea 3% New Zealand 3% Philippines 3% Thailand 3% Industries  Architecture 9% Banking/Financial Services 9% Healthcare 9% Life sciences 9% Manufacturing 9% Media 9% Mobility (Transport and Automotive) 9% Public Sector 9% Retail 9% Technology and Telecoms 9% Resources/Energy 9% 50  ===== PAGE 51 ===== Total revenue size in USD 49% $500–999.99 million 34% $1–4.99 billion 17% $5 billion or more Number of years in operation 36% 10–20 years 60% 20 years + 4% 3–10 years Respondents by role Chief Operating Officer 15% Chief Sustainability Officer 14% Chief Financial Officer 14% Chief Strategy Officer 8% Chief Human Resources Officer 7% Chief Risk Officer 6% Chief Information Officer 6% Chief Marketing Officer 5% Chief Product Officer 4% Chief Digital Officer 4% Chief Data Officer 4% Chief Technology Officer 3% Chief Analytics Officer 3% Chief Revenue Officer 2% Chief Compliance Officer 2% Chief Administrative Officer 2% Chief Executive Officer 1% 51  ===== PAGE 52 ===== Fujitsu Uvance Logo  © Fujitsu 2024.

Soaring resource prices and energy  issues are being exacerbated by rifts in the  international community, and climate change is  leading to increasingly frequent extreme weather  events and natural disasters on a massive scale. The  signs are that these crises are becoming more  complex and prolonged, and are seriously impacting  the global economy and people’s day-to-day lives.  Many companies now regard sustainability as central  to their management, appreciating that they are at a  turning point in rolling out specific initiatives aimed at  helping build a sustainable society through their  business operations. Digital technology has a major  role to play in supporting both industry and our  lifestyles. People are finding that digital  transformation is becoming increasingly familiar and  more important. As a technology company, we in the  Fujitsu Group are conscious that we have a great  responsibility to help with addressing these  problems.    The Fujitsu Group states Our Purpose, which is “to  make the world more sustainable by building trust in  society through innovation”. To achieve Our Purpose,  in May 2023 we defined our Materiality where  sustainability is the core focus of business growth. The essential contributions we must make were identified as:  solving global environmental issues, developing a digital society, and improving people's well-being. At the core  of these three contributions, we specified 11 issues that we need to address, including tackling climate change,  maintaining security of information, eliminating the digital divide, and contributing to healthcare for an  improved quality of life. In the process of defining our Materiality, we sought the cooperation of a wide range of  stakeholders, including customers, institutional investors, and our own employees, in a series of discussions  aimed at identifying the areas where the Fujitsu Group, in particular, should be focusing its efforts. Identifying  target areas for the Fujitsu Group will enable us to leverage co-creation to accelerate our sustainability  transformation (SX) with our customers and partners, solve social issues and, through those initiatives, achieve  sustainable growth of the Group.    This year, we also formulated our vision for 2030 of “being a technology company that realizes net positive  through digital services”. The Fujitsu Group defines net positive as maximizing financial returns, addressing the  three essential contributions of Materiality and positively impacting society as a whole through technology and  innovation. By creating outputs and outcomes in both financial and non-financial targets and by continuing the  cycle of investing in our corporate activities, we will continue to create the value both for our customers and  society. As well as making the most of the Fujitsu Group’s strengths of leading-edge technology and technical  prowess, we are aiming to achieve our vision through cross-industry approaches that go beyond the boundaries  of industries and organizations.    The origins of value creation in the Fujitsu Group are closely tied to its efforts in areas such as respect for  human rights, acceptance of diversity and equity, human resource development and maintenance of the  environment, and we promote them through our GRB (Global Responsible Business) framework. In human  rights, in FY2022 the Fujitsu Group revised the “Fujitsu Group Human Rights Statement” for the first time in the  eight years, setting out our approach and initiatives on respecting human rights. In the statement, we affirm our  Message from the CEO  Takahito Tokita  CEO, Fujitsu Limited  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 4 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  2-2  © Fujitsu 2023  support for the international norms and pledge to respect the human rights of all stakeholders in our business  activities in accordance with those norms. The Fujitsu Group demonstrated its commitment to the environment  this year by setting a target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions across its entire value chain (Scope 1, 2 and  3) by FY2040, and obtained Net-Zero Target certification from the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). To  reach this target, we aim to source 100% of the electricity used in its business operations from renewable  energy by FY2030. As a corporate SX leader, the Fujitsu Group not only engages in its own sustainability  management but is also leveraging the knowledge and expertise gained through that engagement to work  with its customers and partners to solve societal issues.    Finally, as a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, the Fujitsu Group supports the 10 principles in the  four areas of human rights, labor, the environment, and anti-corruption. We are absolutely committed to  minimizing negative impacts on people and society and to promoting a corporate culture that does not  tolerate any wrongdoings.  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 5 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023  FUJITSU-PUBLIC  3-1  © Fujitsu 2023  The Core Elements of the Fujitsu Way  The Fujitsu Group established the Fujitsu Way in 2002 as a principle for the conduct of its people. In response  to changes in society and the business environment, the company revised the philosophy in 2008 to further  instill awareness in its people working around the globe.  With the world becoming more closely interconnected, fast-changing and uncertain, and with various threats  to global sustainability emerging, the Fujitsu Group renewed the Fujitsu Way in 2020. The goal was to use  technology to deliver value for customers and contribute proactively to the transformation of society.  Accordingly, we set out Our Purpose, which is “to make the world more sustainable by building trust in society  through innovation”.  The Fujitsu Way comprises three parts:     Our Purpose : Why Fujitsu exists in society   Our Values : The important sense of value each person should have   Code of Conduct : What we should comply    Our Values represent an action cycle consisting of Aspiration, Trust and Empathy, which is necessary to achieve  Our Purpose. As members of society, our employees will comply with the Code of Conduct.  We aim to achieve Our Purpose by engaging in corporate activities that are based on the Fujitsu Way and that  underpin the actions of each person in the Group.    Click below for further details.

All Fujitsu employees work to  achieve Our Purpose in their daily activities, while  keeping in mind Our Values (Aspiration, Trust, and  Empathy) and the Code of Conduct as they deliver  value to customers and society.     Fujitsu Way   Our Story      Activities to Promote the Fujitsu Way  In-house Communication Initiatives  Fujitsu has been deploying in-house communication  initiatives to boost the degree of empathy with the  Fujitsu Way.  To promote the Fujitsu Way globally, we have  appointed Fujitsu Way promotion leaders as part of  the corporate governance structure. These  individuals are responsible for promoting the Fujitsu  Way on the front lines, and they participate in  regular Fujitsu Way Meetings with the CEO as a way  of spurring motivation.  We have also produced a Fujitsu Way booklet and  shared it with employees worldwide to ensure that  each and every Fujitsu employee understands the  Fujitsu Way and makes it their own. The booklet  incorporates management’s thinking on ways to implement change in Fujitsu. It also includes the words of  former CEOs and other pioneers plus the background to their messages, which today form the company’s DNA,  embedded in the Fujitsu Way. We will continue to communicate the Fujitsu Way through workshops and videos,  to ensure that all employees engage in the Fujitsu Way and work toward achieving Our Purpose.    Broadening the Message through Purpose Carving®  In 2020, with the need to coalesce the ideas of each and every employee to generate greater synergy and  achieve Our Purpose, we started rolling out the Purpose Carving® program(*1), an initiative to shape and  inform each individual's own purpose (My Purpose).  Purpose Carving® is an interactive program that enables participants to reflect on their personal journeys and  values, carving out their own purpose as they contemplate the future. With 70,000 employees worldwide  having completed the program as of July 2023, the overlaying of their purposes on Fujitsu's corporate Purpose  Transforming Our Corporate Culture  Our Purpose  Sample pages from the Fujitsu Way booklet  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 7 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  3-2-2  © Fujitsu 2023  provides the driving force for transformation. Fujitsu  also initiated Purpose Reflections, a program in  which participants reflect on the overlap between  their daily work and My Purpose, engaging in growth  and relationship-building initiatives which are driven  by My Purpose and supported by materials and  applications.  In 2021, as part of the Purpose Carving® program,  we launched a program of live-streamed events  titled 'Fujitra Radio with Leaders'. This enabled  employees to watch interviews with Fujitsu's  executive leaders, who shared their insights into  their individual purposes and thoughts on  transformation. A total of 38 executives took turns  participating in this weekly program, attracting an  overall audience of 56,500. Through such  promotional activities, Fujitsu aims to generate  individual and organizational behavior  transformation by helping employees to discover their own purpose and by reconciling everyone's own  purpose with Fujitsu's Purpose.    *1 Purpose Carving® was selected as the winner of the Excellence Award in the Corporate HR category of HR Award 2022 (sponsored  by the HR Award Steering Committee and supported by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare).    Sustainability Contribution Awards  The Sustainability Contribution Awards program is an in-house program established to help achieve Fujitsu's  Purpose. To create the type of sustainable society that Fujitsu envisions, the entire organization - individuals and  the company - must innovate and generate new value based on Our Purpose and business direction. Therefore,  the Sustainability Contribution Awards are designed to not only recognize Outputs to Society, but to also  include awards for Organizational Cultural Change that brings meaningful transformation to the way things  have traditionally been done. General Judges recruited from within the Fujitsu Group, Fujitsu Way promotion  leaders, and the CSuO(*2) serve as judges; they base their decisions on the extent to which the entries embody  the values and purpose reflected in the Fujitsu Way and on the various elements of Global Responsible  Business (GRB).  In FY2023, a total of 222 applications were received from Fujitsu Group companies worldwide, resulting in the  presentation of one Grand Prize and five Excellence Awards. Overviews of the winning projects are listed  below.    *2 Chief Sustainability Officer    Grand Prize Winner   Rapid discovery of unknown causes and effects related to cancer drug resistance using Fugaku  In collaboration with Tokyo Medical and Dental University, we developed a technology to discover, from  among more than 1,000 trillion different possibilities, the previously unknown causal factors that  characterize a patient in whom a drug is expected to be effective. Fugaku was used to implement the  newly developed AI technology for scientific discovery, intended to make it possible to discover new  causal relationships. This technology is expected to be utilized to facilitate the discovery of effective,  personalized anticancer drugs.    Excellence Award Projects   Driving carbon neutrality across industries in a mobility society  To achieve a carbon-neutral mobility society in the last mile and in regional transportation, this project  contributes to a reduction in emissions by supporting vehicle electrification and the use of renewable  energy to improve the operational and energy efficiency of EVs for fleet operators (e.g., logistics, cabs,  buses, and regional transportation) and local governments.   Success in halving the search period for clean ammonia synthesis catalyst candidates  In a joint research project with Atmonia, a venture company that develops methods of ammonia synthesis  designed to reduce CO2 emissions, a new quantum chemical simulation method was developed and  Illustration of executives who participated in  ‘Fujitra Radio with Leaders’  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 8 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  3-2-3  © Fujitsu 2023  combined with Fujitsu's AI causal discovery technology to successfully halve the time required to search for  ammonia catalyst materials.   Promoting resource recycling by making recycled materials valuable to the environment  This project is a collaboration with Teijin Limited to build and apply a platform to the market to drive the  use of recycled materials and the implementation of environmentally sensitive design, utilizing Teijin's  carbon fiber and aramid fiber recycling initiatives and Fujitsu's blockchain technology.   Design thinking practices for mindset and culture reform  Over the course of a year, 704 employees contributed to solving social and customer issues by  participating in a total of 308 sessions to practice and apply design thinking to their work by asking and  solving their own questions based on their feelings of empathy with the issues.

Reflecting the newly established materiality, our vision for 2030 is to be “a technology company that realizes  net positive(*1) through digital services''.  Our value creation model is based on capital inputs and business activities that aim to create a sustainable  society by focusing on key strategies for Fujitsu and to develop the priority issues for sustainability  management under the Global Responsible Business (GRB) framework. The outputs derived from these  initiatives are positioned as financial and non-financial indicators, and the resulting outcomes provide value to  society.  We will continue to invest as inputs the various outputs and outcomes generated through these activities, while  also working to enhance the value delivered to a range of stakeholders.    *1 Fujitsu defines net positive as follows: “In addition to maximizing financial returns, we are committed to solving global environmental  problems, developing a digital society, and improving people’s well-being.

We specified Materiality in 2018 under the Basic  CSR Policy but have now updated it to encompass Materiality in Management, which incorporates the  perspective of delivering value to customers and society through our business activities.  Looking toward 2030, we conducted medium- to long-term evaluations from the perspectives of Fujitsu itself  and its stakeholders, and we identified priority issues to be resolved on the path to sustainable growth. These  fall under two categories (Essential Contributions and Foundation for Achieving Sustainable Development). In  the first category of Essential Contributions, we will leverage the development of Fujitsu Uvance and other  businesses to provide customers and society with value that contributes to solving global environmental issues,  developing a digital society, and improving people's well-being. Furthermore, we will strengthen our  technology, management foundation, and human capital to create the Foundation for Achieving Sustainable  Development as the source of value creation for the Fujitsu Group, while supporting the creation of new  business models and spurring innovation.  The results of this revised approach to Materiality are being applied to risk management throughout Fujitsu. In  the potential risk assessment conducted throughout the Fujitsu Group, issues identified through Materiality  assessment are reported as key risks, and ''climate change'', ''human resources and human rights'' and  ''information security'' are identified as ''main business risks''.  And Materiality-related initiatives are recommended as a goal-setting item in the “Executive Performance  Management” evaluation system for executives at FUJITSU VP-level and above. The non-financial indicators  based on Materiality are being progressively linked to the evaluation indicators for executive remuneration  (Executive Director bonuses).  Going forward, we will continue to promote company-wide initiatives related to Materiality, reduce and avoid  critical management risks, and maximize business opportunities. In this way, we aim to enhance the corporate  value of the Fujitsu Group and contribute to achieving net positives in the areas of environmental issues, digital  society, and people's well-being.

Going forward, we will conduct periodic reviews on an annual basis and revise as necessary.  This process receives third-party assurance.

In anticipation of future circumstances in 2030, create a draft  materiality matrix that prioritizes 25 social issues from 40 social issues in terms of the risks and  opportunities those issues present. The draft materiality matrix is created by conducting comprehensive  assessments and assigning scores to issues from the perspectives of their importance to Fujitsu (financial  impact of the environmental and social issues on Fujitsu) and their importance to stakeholders  (environmental and social impact of Fujitsu business activities).   Through personal interviews and meetings of the Sustainability Management Committee, conduct  assessments and discuss the validation of the draft materiality matrix in terms of Fujitsu’s distinctiveness  (affinity with the Fujitsu brand), and determine the final materiality matrix (consolidated from 25 issues to  18 issues).

Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 23 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023  FUJITSU-PUBLIC  3-5-1  © Fujitsu 2023  Approach  To ensure a stable, long-term contribution to the realization of Our Purpose, it is essential to build trusted  relationships with all stakeholders and to pursue sustainable growth. We have therefore incorporated non- financial indicators as part of our core business activities, and we are promoting initiatives to achieve them in  tandem with our financial targets. Based on this approach, and to measure the progress of in-house reforms,  the Fujitsu Group established three non-financial indicators: the Net Promoter ScoreSM (NPS®) (*1) represents  trust from customers; Employee Engagement indicates the relationship between the company and its  employees; and the DX Promotion Indices highlight the advances made in the Fujitsu Group's own digital  transformation initiatives.  As part of a review of non-financial indicators in May 2023, we determined to continue measuring NPS and  Employee Engagement and we added two new indicators. In the area of Diverse Leadership we will track the  ratio of women in leadership roles, and as an environmental indicator we are focusing on the Reduction of  Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions.    *1 Net Promoter, Net Promoter Score, and NPS are trademarks of NICE Satmetrix, Inc., Bain & Company, Inc. and Fred Reichheld.      Net Promoter ScoreSM (NPS®)  NPS® is an indicator that enables objective evaluation of the relationship of trust with customers, or customer  loyalty. Unlike customer satisfaction, which indicates the degree of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with a  purchased product or service, customer loyalty is characterized by the ability to determine the degree of  customer attachment and the likelihood of repeat purchases. The Fujitsu Group employs customer NPS as one  of its non-financial indicators with the aim of realizing customer-centric management. By listening to our  customers' views via NPS and offering services that appropriately suit their requirements, or by making  proposals that anticipate their future needs, the value of the customer experience will be enhanced and our  customer NPS will rise further. We believe that creating such a positive cycle will result in a boost to the  corporate value of the Fujitsu Group.        As a structure to achieve this objective, at the working level we have appointed customer experience leaders in  each region to take the lead in a timely manner in relation to improvement activities. On the management side,  meetings of the CX Steering Board are convened every quarter, headed by the CEO and attended by those  responsible for Fujitsu’s business operations in all regions. This system ensures that customer issues are reliably  resolved at the working level while simultaneously addressing them as management issues. The  implementation of a ''feedback loop'' allows those involved to propose improvement actions, examine areas for  investment, and verify the effectiveness of measures already taken.  Given this background, we set a target of 3.7 points in FY2022 based on the improvement result of +2.3 points  in FY2021. As a result of our activities, however, we recorded a significant jump of 18.1 points over the previous  fiscal year. Specifically, the Fujitsu Group was recognized for providing proposals based on a deep  understanding of the customer's business challenges, for our experience in offering digital transformation  projects, and for the initiatives undertaken in Fujitsu’s own transformation.  Non-Financial Indicators  NPS results and target  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 24 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC    3-5-2  © Fujitsu 2023  At the same time, for the future, we acknowledge the need to focus on consultancy support relevant to our  customers’ business challenges and on execution capabilities to advance transformation for our customers.  Promoting reskilling and digital transformation offering enhancement will elevate the capability of the entire  Fujitsu Group to offer comprehensive business support for customers.  Based on the results of the customer survey conducted globally in FY2022, we will continue to improve our  strengths in the areas that were highly appraised and focus on areas that require improvement, aiming to boost  the score by 20 points until FY2025 as the target of the medium-term management plan.      Employee Engagement  The Fujitsu Group's greatest management resource is its employees, who are the source of the value provided  to customers. Our experience suggests that highly engaged employees are better able to provide high-quality  services to our customers, and that positive customer feedback correlates to an increase in employees'  responsiveness to their work. We believe that improving the engagement of each employee leads to the  growth of both the individual and the Fujitsu Group.  Based on this concept, to measure the sustainable growth of the Fujitsu Group we established Employee  Engagement as a non-financial indicator that shows the mindset of employees and their empathy with the  organizational culture. At Fujitsu, Employee Engagement is defined as “an indicator that shows the degree of  employees’ motivation and attachment to work and their willingness to contribute independently in empathy  with the company’s direction and purpose.” Employee Engagement can also be considered an indicator that  illustrates the Fujitsu Group has the necessary human resources and other capabilities, including organizational  culture, to gain the trust of customers as a DX partner.        The target Employee Engagement value of 75 for FY2022 is a figure that has been determined by  benchmarking against global corporations. The actual scores can vary greatly across the Group, because they  are impacted by the relevant company's business area, the business environments in different countries and  regions, and the diversity of our employees’ countries of origin. While it is true that 75 is an ambitious target for  the Fujitsu Group, we are nonetheless striving to achieve this goal with the aim of being on par with other  global enterprises.  Fujitsu has put in place a structure for global collaboration across all regions to boost engagement. This  includes the Center of Excellence, a specialist team dedicated to creating highly engaged organizations, and  Human Resource Business Partners, a team of strategic HR partners who are active in every work location. As a  specific initiative, we have introduced measures to broaden employees' workstyle options, after clarifying their  individual purpose. This includes a semiannual survey conducted on a global basis to measure employee  engagement. The objective is to gauge in a timely manner changes in organizational culture, employee  workstyles, opinions, and awareness, and to swiftly reflect the outcomes back to management.  Based on the surveys conducted to date, to enhance engagement it is important for senior and middle  management to take action together with team members, so this point is being reinforced in every  organization. Also, it is crucial that managers and staff develop a strong relationship of trust. Trust is a core  feature of the Fujitsu Way and the corporate purpose, and trust is built by discussing a shared vision based on  each person’s individual purpose and does not flow simply from routine task reporting and discussions. Strong  trusted relationships can help to overcome a range of environmental changes and lead to mutual growth for  both parties. The surveys include questions to periodically measure these relationships, with the questions  leading to mutual opportunities for behavioral change and growth while also serving as a catalyst for initiatives  to boost engagement. Non-financial indicators are very effective, and we believe it would be even better if we  could incorporate employee engagement data and publish a reference model in the future, based on data  analysis, with the aim of improving each of the non-financial indicators.

By conducting detailed diagnoses for each department, we can gauge the progress of our DX efforts and the  outcomes of measures so that they can be linked to future actions. Another objective in specifying these  metrics is to accumulate knowledge that can be leveraged when working as a partner on DX projects with  customers. By implementing initiatives in line with the DX Promotion Indices and by enhancing the level of DX  maturity, we believe the Fujitsu Group can relay to customers through its business activities the insights gained  in the process.    *2 Evaluation indicators for digital management reform on a six-point maturity scale, ranging from 0 to 5. There are seven items relating  to ''Indices for ideal approaches to management for promoting DX and systems'' and two items relating to “Indices for development  of IT systems as a foundation in achieving DX”.        Fujitsu set a numerical target of 3.5 for the DX Promotion Indices in FY2022 but exceeded that with a result of  3.56. According to the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry's DX Promotion Index, companies  scoring an average of 3 or more across all qualitative indicators are classified as being a “Noteworthy DX  Company”. We consider this to be a recognition that we have reached a leading position among Japan's top DX  enterprises and the fact that we are also performing at a global level.  Compared with the results from the diagnoses in FY2021, we recorded improvements in three areas: ''mindset  and corporate culture'', ''incorporation into the business'' and ''IT governance framework''. In terms of mindset  and corporate culture, initiatives such as our job-based personnel system and Fujitsu Innovation Circuit, a  business creation program, are now firmly entrenched throughout the company. Regarding incorporation into  the business, we accelerated initiatives including Fujitsu Uvance, service delivery reform, and business process  transformation, while the promotion of global integration efforts also led to enhancements. Finally, in the area  of our IT governance framework, major improvements were triggered by the consolidation of IT systems under  the OneFujitsu Project – including OneERP and OneCRM – which led to greater global standardization.  The DX Promotion Indices are specified on the assumption that each company conducts self-diagnosis. To  ensure objectivity in the self-diagnoses undertaken at the end of each fiscal year, as a basis for scoring the  Fujitsu Group uses input from all employees (gathered in Group-wide semiannual surveys on opinions regarding  change) and incorporates a third-party evaluation by Ridgelinez Limited. The feedback from employees is not  used solely as the basis for measuring the DX Promotion Indices but is also shared with executives, department  heads, and DX leaders across all departments as part of the Group-wide DX project ''Fujitra” (Fujitsu  Transformation). The objective is to gauge the progress of the Group overall, as well as in each department,  and to use the information when making decisions on the next measures to be taken and on any necessary  adjustments to the trajectory of the project.  By implementing a range of measures based on the DX Promotion Indices, we have created a foundation that  enables all Group employees to adopt initiatives for reform. Furthermore, we view the recognition by external  stakeholders of the Fujitsu Group's transformation to be a major achievement.      DX Promotion Indices  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 26 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC    3-5-4  © Fujitsu 2023  New Indices  As part of the Medium-Term Management Plan announced in May 2023, in addition to the existing personnel- related indicator of Employee Engagement we specified a new Diverse Leadership indicator, the ratio of  women in leadership roles, as well as an environmental indicator for the Reduction of GHG Emissions.    Diverse Leadership (ratio of women in leadership roles)  The DE&I vision for the Fujitsu Group includes “Build an inclusive and equitable culture where everyone belongs  and can be completely themselves.” Gender is positioned as one of the five focus areas in the Global DE&I  Vision & Inclusion Wheel.  To transition into an enterprise capable of sustainably generating innovations and providing value to customers  while meeting the requirements of communities with diversified values, it is essential to create an environment  and culture in which a diversity of people can each optimally leverage their different viewpoints and abilities.  As a first step toward this objective, we have set the ratio of women in leadership roles as a new non-financial  indicator. We based this on the results of research that determined “when the ratio of a minority group in an  organization reaches 30% a chain reaction occurs that changes the organizational culture.” The target set for  the end of FY2030 is to have a 30% ratio of women in leadership roles throughout the Fujitsu Group, with an  interim milestone target of 20% by the end of FY2025.  In addition to achieving the goals described above, to create an environment and culture in which a diversity of  people can each optimally leverage their different viewpoints and abilities, we will encourage various initiatives,  such as mindset transformation, positive action, and the promotion of Work Life Shift to enhance our working  environments.        Reduction of GHG Emissions  The Paris Agreement (COP21), adopted in December 2015, set out a long-term, shared worldwide goal of  limiting the average global temperature increase to considerably less than 2℃ and preferably 1.5℃ over pre- Industrial Revolution temperatures, as well as the goal of carbon neutrality (net zero emissions) by the second  half of this century. Subsequently, following a review of climate change impacts (loss, damage, etc.) based on  the latest scientific knowledge, it was declared at the COP26 Glasgow Agreement that the preferred 1.5℃  target would now become the actual target and that the world must aim to achieve net zero by mid-century  (around 2050). These rapid changes led the Fujitsu Group to announce a target of net zero for GHG emissions  in its supply chain by FY2040, with an interim target of net zero for GHG emissions in Fujitsu’s own business  areas by FY2030. To help achieve these objectives, we released the Environmental Action Plan (Stage XI). This  plan runs up to FY2025, a milestone on the path to the targets, and will give shape to our specific initiatives as  we work toward the realization of carbon neutrality.   Ratio of women in leadership roles  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 27 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC    3-5-5  © Fujitsu 2023        As a leading SX company, Fujitsu has a role to play in applying technology to help solve challenges for  customers and society while expanding and enhancing the value provided as we collaborate with customers  and partners to achieve a sustainable future. It is therefore essential to confirm the global trends and the  actions taken in regard to climate change challenges, because a delayed response could lead to a loss of  business opportunities. Against this backdrop, we consider the reduction of GHG emissions to be a critical issue  and are working on it as one of our non-financial indicators.

To  achieve this, the aim of our intellectual property management policy is to contribute to innovation and new  value creation in the Fujitsu Group by strategically building and utilizing intellectual capital, including our  technology, our brand and our designs.  Intellectual property management has two facets. One is the construction of an intellectual property portfolio  by acquiring the rights for the intellectual capital already held by the Fujitsu Group and then using that  portfolio to create new value. The other facet is risk management, which consists of lowering the incidence of  risks likely to diminish our corporate or social value, primarily through measures that promote respect for and  prevent violations of our rights and those of third parties.    Contributing to Value Creation  We are progressing and appropriately managing the acquisition of the rights to the technology developed by  the Fujitsu Group and to the designs and brands created to deploy that technology in the community. This  expands our opportunities for generating licensing income, better differentiates our offerings from the  technologies and services provided by competitors and maintains or enhances the competitive advantage of  Fujitsu Group technologies and services.  We are also assisting with the search for new growth opportunities by investigating, analyzing and sharing  information on a wide range of global technology trends, including the status of patent applications in  strategically important areas for the Fujitsu Group. Open Source Software (OSS) is an indispensable resource for  digital services, and Fujitsu is an active participant in the OSS community, help  ing to create environments that promote innovation and build a value co-creation ecosystem by formulating  rules for the use of intellectual property.    Reducing the Risk of Value Loss  One important way to reduce the risk of losing corporate value by protecting intellectual property. Third party  violations of rights held by the Fujitsu Group not only obstruct the progress of our business strategy, they also  have the potential to negatively impact customers’ trust in the Fujitsu brand in a competitive environment. For  this reason, we constantly monitor for violations of our rights, and where a proposal is discovered that could  potentially cause a rights violation, we immediately put in place appropriate countermeasures.  Fujitsu’s Code of Conduct which, together with our Purpose and Values makes up the Fujitsu Way, clearly states  our commitment to respecting and protecting intellectual property and respecting the intellectual property  rights of others, just as they respect our own acquisition of rights to intellectual capital. We are formulating  Rules for Handling Intellectual Property Rights that link this Code of Conduct to specific actions, and these  rules are being applied to Fujitsu and Group companies in Japan that undertake actions involving intellectual  property. We are also working to reduce the risks of violating rights held by third parties through measures  such as thoroughly researching patent violation avoidance, careful OSS license management, and responding  to in-house consultation requests concerning the terms of intellectual property agreements.     Fujitsu's Intellectual Property  Intellectual Property (IP) Strategy to Support  Fujitsu's Purpose  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 29 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  3-6-2  © Fujitsu 2023        Structure of the Intellectual Property Division  The Intellectual Property Division (the Intellectual Property Global Head Office), which belongs to the Legal  and Intellectual Property Unit under the General Counsel, consists of the IP Intelligence Service Office, which  supports research laboratories and provides IP landscapes to the front office, the Intellectual Property Strategy  Office, which formulates and promotes company-wide intellectual property strategies based on  communication with management, and the Intellectual Property Center, which implements intellectual  property portfolio construction. In addition to collaborating within the division, we also work with the Legal and  Intellectual Business Promotion Center, which is affiliated with the Global Business Legal Department and  promotes intellectual property activities for business producers and SEs, and Fujitsu Techno Research Ltd.,  which provides intellectual property-related services, to execute intellectual property management.  The formulation of IP management strategy and policy for the activities of the Intellectual Property Division is  not limited solely to the Division itself, but is undertaken in collaboration with the Technology Units headed by  the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and Chief Portfolio Officer (CPO) and with the responsible IP strategy  managers within the Business Units. In this way, IP management is integrated with our broader management  strategy and business portfolio strategy. In addition, at meetings of the Independent Directors & Auditors  Council, which includes external directors and auditors, the Head of the Legal and Intellectual Property Unit  reports on the strategy and progress of intellectual property management and provides opportunities for  discussion with management.    Group-wide Global Collaboration  Fujitsu has developed an intellectual property governance structure to make the best possible use of its  intellectual capital throughout the Fujitsu Group. This ensures that IP-related activities undertaken by Group  companies in Japan are integrated. Where a company undertakes independent IP activities as a partial  exception, a reporting line is set up and the activity is conducted through close collaboration. Globally,  including the utilization of the reporting line, regular meetings are held involving regional IP managers in  Europe, India, China, Australia and the United States. Additionally, through intellectual property support for  research facilities established in another 8 countries around the world to ensure that all IP management  conforms to the realities of global business.    Collaboration with Technology and Business Portfolios  Fujitsu’s stated purpose is: “To make the world more sustainable by building trust in society through innovation”,  and our key strategies have sustainability as their starting point. One of the key strategies for the Intellectual  Property Division is its Technology strategy, which is to enhance its core technologies with AI as the focus.  Taking a structured approach to progressing Fujitsu’s IP activities in collaboration with our Technology and  Business Portfolio strategies helps to maintain and strengthen the Fujitsu Group’s competitive advantage and  acquire new business opportunities. IP activities go far beyond merely exercising our IP rights to generate  licensing income. Our focus is on growing our customer base and strengthening our negotiating position by  highlighting the Fujitsu Group’s technological strengths and the superiority of its offerings, and by  distinguishing our own offerings from those of our competitors. We achieve this through activities such as  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 30 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  3-6-3  © Fujitsu 2023  discovering patents at the development stage and acquiring the rights for those patents, and then highlighting  those patents during business negotiations.      In Japan, activities of the Intellectual Property Division are carried out together with those Group companies  engaged in IP activities. There are some exceptions, in which the Intellectual Property Division establishes  reporting lines to, and implements closely coordinated activities with, certain companies that conduct IP  activities independently.  The Division has also established global reporting lines with regional intellectual property managers (IP CoE) in  Europe, China, Australia and the United States, and holds regular meetings to ensure that all IP activities  conform to the realities of global business.      Initiatives  Fujitsu’s purpose is: “To make the world more sustainable by building trust in society through innovation”, and  we pursue our key strategies with sustainability as the starting point, as set out in the Medium-Term  Management Plan released in May 2023. In terms of investment in intellectual property, Fujitsu is building an IP  portfolio intended to create added value in our services business and is enhancing AI-centered technologies as  part of our Technology strategy, one of our key strategies. We are also engaged in leveraging IP for co-creation,  including collaboration to help achieve the SDGs under the FUJITSU Technology Licensing Program™ for SDGs.  The Company is also engaged in using OSS, international standardization and rulemaking to establish social  rules that engender trust and confidence in deploying Fujitsu’s advanced technologies, and strategic initiatives  to support the Key Focus Areas from a brand and design perspective.  The following section highlights case studies of open innovation involving key technologies where particular  emphasis is placed on building an IP portfolio, as well as case studies of IP activities aimed at solving societal  challenges, case studies of open innovation where IP is used for co-creation, and case studies of international  standardization and rulemaking that address the creation of social rules that can be used globally.      Open Innovation Cases Studies  Computing: Digital Annealer (Co-creation with MELCO Investments)  Deploying the Digital Annealer architecture in stock portfolio optimization calculations  Having developed Digital Annealer (DA) as a quantum-inspired architecture dedicated to solving combinatorial  optimization problems at high speed, Fujitsu is applying for numerous patents, primarily for the core  technology. The Company has been conducting trials and co-creation with clients based on differentiated  technologies that are supported by patents. In the area of investment in equities managed by MELCO  Investments, DA was successfully used to generate portfolios comprising combinations of stocks with the  lowest risk. As a result, MELCO Investments began using DA to manage financial assets in some areas of its  actual portfolio management operations in January 2022.  Conventional approaches to performing optimization calculations to determine the optimal portfolio from  several hundred stocks were highly impractical because they required massive computing power and a lot of  time. Using Fujitsu’s DA, it is now possible to perform this task in about 10 minutes. This has enabled MELCO  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 31 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  3-6-4  © Fujitsu 2023  Investments to use analytical results, based on more accurate calculations, in their actual asset management  operations.     MELCO Investments: How Digital Annealer is Pushing the Boundaries of Financial Services    Pushing the Boundaries of Financial Services with Digital Annealer    Networking: IOWN (Strategic Business Alliance with NTT)  Joint R&D to develop next-generation 6G network technology  NTT Corporation and Fujitsu forged a strategic business alliance in April 2021 to engage in joint R&D activities  toward the “realization of a sustainable digital society.” The innovation created through this alliance is designed  to contribute to achieving the vision of a new low-energy, high-efficiency digital society through global, open  collaboration with a wide range of partners who support the Innovative Optical and Wireless Network (IOWN)  initiative.   Through this alliance, the two companies aim to conduct joint research in fields where both can leverage their  strengths, backed by communications technologies such as the world's most advanced optical technologies for  which NTT and Fujitsu combined hold the largest number of patents worldwide. With their operational  expertise, plus Fujitsu's world-leading computing technologies, the companies aim to fulfill their shared vision  through global, open innovation that leverages the results of their research.     NTT and Fujitsu Embark on Strategic Alliance to Drive ''Realization of Sustainable Digital Society''    AI: Joint Development with Subaru   Employing AI modeling to deliver quality assurance in manufacturing  Subaru Corporation and Fujitsu have been co-creating through PoCs, development, and trials since 2019, using  high-precision AI modeling to deliver quality assurance in the engine component (camshaft) grinding process.  As part of this collaboration, the two companies created and commercialized the industry's first AI invention to  implement automated quality inspection and prediction of engine parts, and jointly applied for patents. In  addition, the two companies developed and verified the “FUJITSU Manufacturing Industry Solution COLMINA  Production Line Quality AI Operation and Management Package'', which provides management support for the  AI model in anticipation of mass production operations. The system became fully operational in February 2022.  As a result, quality assurance during engine component grinding was achieved with high precision and in real  time. The AI model continues to operate at an efficient level, maintaining AI model quality on an ongoing basis.  Furthermore, Subaru established an AI platform to improve the level of quality assurance using real-time data  throughout its Gunma Manufacturing Division, including at the Oizumi Plant.

It was developed in  collaboration with the Deaf and the hard-of-hearing  to enable a future that they can enjoy together with  the hearing.   Ontenna is characterized by a gently rounded shape  that does not feel unpleasant as it can be worn like a  hairpin. Fujitsu has applied for and registered design  patents for the main body, the battery charger, and  the controller that can control multiple Ontenna  devices, and has also registered the shape of the  main body as a 3D trademark.  Fujitsu has also  applied for and registered patents for Ontenna's  charging method and communication system, using  a mixed-IP strategy to protect the main body and  peripheral devices.   Ontenna was awarded the “Imperial Invention Prize”  in the 2022 National Commendation for its design  patent.  It has also won several other awards  including the 2019 Good Design Award “Gold Prize,”  the IAUD International Design Award “Grand Prize,”  and the Local Invention Award from the Commissioner of the Japan Patent Office, earning high acclaim from  both inside and outside of Fujitsu.

Fujitsu  engages in collaboration via WIPO GREEN (an online platform for the exchange of environmentally friendly  technologies) and IP matching programs at the national and local government levels, at financial institutions,  and at universities. This contributes to the social diffusion of Fujitsu technologies to help advance a resolution  to COVID-19, to conserve the environment, and to revitalize Japan’s regional economies.   One case study of IP matching is the development of the BeTHERE 3D Scanner, commercialized after robotics  startup Haloworld was given a demonstration of Fujitsu's patented 3D digitizing technology prototype in 2019.  This led to collaboration and the licensing of the patent to Haloworld.  BeTHERE is a 3D scanner that can capture 360-degree images at a chosen location and check the captured  data on the spot. It performs texture mapping to map the captured images to 3D point cloud data where  distances can be determined. With mass production in mind, Haloworld received the license to the technology  for integrating (aligning) 3D point cloud data recorded multiple times from different locations. The company  also upgraded the user interface to enhance operability and made additional improvements, such as  dustproofing and drip-proofing, as well as improving the measurement accuracy by applying the latest LiDAR  (Light Detection and Ranging) sensor to measure the distance to an object.

An e-seal is  a mechanism for guaranteeing the legitimacy of the issuing organization when documents are exchanged  digitally, and e-seal has been specified in ''Guidelines for e-seals'' issued by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and  Communications (MIC).  By linking Fujitsu’s “Fujitsu Computing as a Service Data e-TRUST” service and Teikoku Databank’s knowledge of  corporate identity certification, we confirmed the usefulness of e-seal in actual business operations such as  digital document exchange between companies. We then published a report with recommendations on  standards and systems derived from them.  The Japan Digital Trust Forum (JDTF) to which both Fujitsu and Teikoku Databank are members are engaged in  making rules and building mechanisms that will help in achieving trust in data (digital trust). This includes  helping with research into e-seal systems as well as broader investigations looking at requirements for the  wider use of e-seals, both technologically and operationally, and then publishing those findings as instruction  manuals.  To build a society in which transactions involving all digital documents are conducted both securely and  smoothly, Fujitsu is working to promote the broader adoption of e-seal through rulemaking activities, including  proposals with partner companies and cooperation activities within industry associations.

However, in the current era of VUCA (*1) we face major changes and the  future is difficult to predict. It is therefore important that we, as a member of the global community, conduct  business activities under the leadership of senior management that are aimed at resolving environmental,  societal and economic problems and that will produce beneficial impacts for society. In April 2020, we  established a Sustainability Management Committee that will drive a sustainability-focused management  approach under the supervision and direction of the Board of Directors Meeting and the Executive  Management Council Meeting. As of fiscal 2023, the committee is made up of members of the Board of  Directors, including Representative Directors Mr. Tokita (Chairman), Representative Directors Mr. Furuta (Vice  Chairman), and Director Mr. Isobe.  The objective of this committee is sustainability management that takes into account environmental, societal  and economic impacts as well as stakeholder (*2) interests, ensuring that the company prospers in the long  term as a responsible global enterprise. Specific initiatives will be in line with our values and our purpose, set  out in the revised Fujitsu Way, and will include boosting our efforts in non-financial areas. These include respect  for human rights, acceptance of diversity and equity, human resource development, maintenance of the global  environment and contributing to the development of regional communities. Our goal is to achieve sustainable,  long-term improvement in the corporate value of the Fujitsu Group.  The committee is scheduled to meet every six months, and on an ad hoc basis as required, to check on the  progress of our activities in non-financial areas and to confirm and discuss if we are on track to meet our  targets for the non-financial indicators. The committee will also discuss new activities, including in sustainability  businesses, and then report to the Executive Management Council Meeting and the Board of Directors Meeting  with the results. The committee is chaired by the CEO, who will nominate executives with a perspective on  sustainability management for appointment as committee members. (As of May 2023, the committee had 13  members, including the chair.) The first committee meeting was held in April 2020, followed by semiannual  meetings – with the most recent meeting held in March 2023. To date, the meetings have been characterized  by lively discussions on topics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the accelerating global movement toward  carbon neutrality, the ideal future shape of the Fujitsu Group, the mission of the committee, details of the non- financial indicators, an overview of Global Responsible Business activities and progress toward achieving the  related targets.        *1 VUCA: Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity  *2 The Fujitsu Group’s stakeholders: The Fujitsu Group regards our people, customers, partners, community and shareholders as its  stakeholders. Government authorities, NPOs, NGOs, and similar organizations are also particularly important stakeholders within this  community.    Sustainability Management in the Fujitsu  Group  System Chart  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 37 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  4-1-2  © Fujitsu 2023  Global Responsible Business  Since its CSR Promotion Committee established the Basic Strategy Working Group in 2010, the Fujitsu Group  has identified Five Priority Issues in its Basic CSR Policy and has been promoting activities that address those  priority issues. The working group conducted interviews with outside experts regarding the expectations and  demands on Fujitsu, based on an awareness of global CSR standards and social issues.  However, recent years have seen a further ramping up of demand for initiatives aimed at responding to  challenges on a global scale, including the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by the  United Nations and the coming into effect of the COP 21 Paris Agreement related to climate change. The  Fujitsu Group has employed a materiality analysis in a Groupwide review of the priority issues to ensure that  they reflect changes in its business over the past several years. The result was the establishment of a unified  framework for the priority issues under the new name of Global Responsible Business (GRB).    Global Responsible Business  The GRB framework aims to foster the mindset and corporate culture necessary to realize the Fujitsu Way by  engaging in specific activities that address our priority issues and to earn and maintain the social trust that is a  prerequisite for global business activities. All Group employees must be constantly aware that their companies  are part of society and aim to not only pursue profits but also reduce the negative impact of their business  activities on sustainability issues while maximizing the positive.  To achieve these objectives, we specified goals for each priority issue with March 2023 set as the deadline for  achievement and we have been engaged in a range of activities. We have set new goals with a deadline of  March 2026 and, in order to carry out higher-level activities globally while taking into account the differences  between countries and regions in such areas as local laws and labor markets, we have set Groupwide targets  for all employees. Employees based at our headquarters who are responsible for each of the priority issues led  efforts in formulating these targets, while personnel in overseas regions with similar responsibilities also  provided input in this regard. We will continue to work on specific measures toward achieving the goals.    Raising Awareness and Disseminating Information Internally and Externally  To realize our corporate purpose, we engage in businesses that have a beneficial impact on resolving  challenges in society, and to conduct our operations in a responsible manner throughout all business activities,  we are implementing a range of measures to raise awareness and enhance our employees’ understanding of  GRB. In addition, we disseminate information outside the company to convey to stakeholders the Fujitsu  Group’s position on sustainability management and related initiatives     At internal and external events and presentations, we introduce the non-financial framework around  Fujitsu’s sustainability management and explain how an executive leader has been appointed for each of  the priority issues as we implement initiatives on a global basis.   Employee understanding is further enhanced through our intranet sites in Japanese and English, which are  updated as required by GRB operations staff.   We published a series of 10 articles in Fujitsu’s in-house magazine, in both Japanese and English, featuring  overviews of each of the priority issues as well as specific initiatives. A survey conducted on this series  revealed that approximately 90% of those who read the articles responded that they developed a deeper  understanding of GRB, while around 60% stated that they had changed their way of thinking and behavior.  This illustrates the link to improved understanding and empathy.   We conduct employee awareness surveys in relation to sustainability and utilize the responses when  planning and implementing internal and external initiatives.   In terms of business involvement, we incorporate the GRB perspective in our proposal process to help our  customers solve their sustainability-related management issues. Contents on GRB initiatives such as  environment and wellbeing are included in the proposal materials provided to customers, as we work to  promote further usage and deployment in frontline business interactions.

Fujitsu’s purpose is “to make the world more sustainable by building trust in  society through innovation” and our company has made a commitment, both internally and externally, to  contribute to achieving the SDGs. As a global enterprise that for decades has leveraged technology to create  value for society, Fujitsu has a responsibility to proactively contribute to societal transformation. To help make  the world more sustainable, we aim to generate larger and more beneficial impacts for society, which will also  help to spur ongoing sustainable corporate growth. Fujitsu explained the Value Creation Concept for 2030 in  the Medium-Term Management Plan which was released in May 2023. Our aim is to contributing SDGs by  working on the Essential Contributions of Materiality : ''Solving global environmental issues'', ''Developing a  digital society'', ''Improving people's well-being''.    Fujitsu believes the SDGs essentially define a system transformation that must be achieved by 2030 and that  will act as the foundation for a world in which more than 9 billion people are able to live well, within planetary  boundaries, by 2050. The issues highlighted in the SDGs involve a complex web of environmental, social, and  economic elements. One key to solving these inherent problems is through digital transformation (DX). Fujitsu  will harness the power of digital technology to create ecosystems that transcend industry boundaries and  assist in the transformation of our customers and our own organizations, while playing a part in delivering  fundamental changes to the way society interacts and contributes to the resolution of societal challenges.  The SDGs are an overarching framework of global social and environmental needs and form a common  language for all stakeholders. Fujitsu will use its efforts to realize the SDGs as an opportunity for co-creation  with a wide range of stakeholders, including international agencies, national and regional governments, private  companies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and non-profit organizations (NPOs). By embracing a  multifaceted approach to societal challenges, we can create and maximize positive impacts on an even larger  scale.     Value Creation Model      Practical Application Within Fujitsu  We have built a framework that prompts all our employees to consider which of the 169 targets defined in the  SDGs are relevant to our services and solutions when they are engaged in product planning and business  discussions and when they issue press releases.  The objective is to make our employees routinely conscious of whether they are contributing to achieving the  SDGs so that they approach their business activities from the standpoint of addressing social issues          SDG-related Activities in Fujitsu  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 44 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC    4-3-2  © Fujitsu 2023  Using Digital Technology and Services to Contribute to the SDGs  Contributing to zero emissions by accelerating new catalyst discovery for  clean ammonia production  Ammonia represents a promising carbon-neutral, next-generation energy source because it does not emit CO2  when burned and it is easier to transport than hydrogen. However, the current ammonia industrial production  methods give rise to the emission of large amounts of CO2 in the manufacture of the hydrogen raw material,  through the burning of fossil fuels such as natural gas and oil.  In April 2022, Fujitsu began joint research with Atmonia ehf.(*1) to accelerate the development of catalysts for  the clean production of ammonia, which will contribute to a reduction in CO2 emissions. In February 2023, the  two companies succeeded in reducing the search time for catalyst candidates by more than half by leveraging  high-performance computing (HPC) and AI techniques to develop technology that improves the efficiency of  materials discovery. Using Fujitsu’s HPC, a large number of quantum chemistry simulations were performed  based on Atmonia’s ammonia synthesis simulation data. An AI simulation model was then developed by training  the huge amounts of generated data from the simulations. The trained AI simulation model was used to rapidly  generate much larger number of catalyst candidates than those generated by the simulations. Further, Fujitsu  employed its proprietary AI causal discovery technology to narrow down suitable materials for alloy catalysts  from more than 10,000 ammonia synthesis catalyst candidates .  The two companies aim to contribute to carbon neutrality by using HPC and AI-powered technology to  improve the efficiency of materials search and by selecting catalyst candidates at an early stage and thereby  making sustainable ammonia synthesis a practical reality.        *1 Atmonia ehf is a start-up based in Reykjavík, Iceland, that uses computer simulations and experiments to develop catalysts for the  efficient production of ammonia.

The aims are to achieve circular economies,  starting from the material manufacturing origin, and to popularize reliable recycled materials.      Teijin and Fujitsu together plan to realize and commercialize this under the Fujitsu Uvance banner, as the first  circular economy business.  In January 2023, Teijin and Fujitsu began a demonstration project using the Environmentally Valuable Recycled  Materials platform for bicycle frames. There were a number of problems including energy consumption in the  long-distance transportation of resources(*4) and the lack of established product recovery schemes, as well as  the issue of how to recycle resources from bicycles without green-washing. Despite these, this initiative  demonstrated the value of the platform for tracking resources used in bicycle frame materials and information  on their environmental impact. It also provided visualization of the tracked data and an assessment of the  feasibility of the data collection process.  The project demonstrated the environmental value created through recycling as a business model with  guaranteed reliability, and created a path for environmental value creation in resource recycling for the bicycle  industry. In the future, the aim is to create value through the disclosure of the traced data to bicycle users and  its use in carbon management certification.  Moving forward, the two parties plan further discussions and field trials with partner companies and  organizations, and will work toward the realization of a circular economy by supporting the growth of the  recycling market not only for bicycle frames but in other industries as well.    *2 Environmentally conscious design: Design that considers the whole product lifecycle and aims to reduce environmental impact.  *3 Environmental value: Added value that contributes to the environment through a reduction in the carbon footprint of product  manufacture and transport.

In November 2022, Fujitsu and TORIDOLL Holdings Corporation demonstrated the effectiveness of an AI  demand forecasting service that uses a dynamic ensemble model, based on patented technology from Fujitsu  Research, to predict the number of customers and sales of its Marugame Udon brand by shop, day, and time.  The trial of the service had begun in a staged way in June 2021. With a corporate mission to “provide dining  experiences that move its customers”, TORIDOLL Holdings had formulated a ''DX Vision 2028'' to leverage  digital technologies in its transformation into a truly global food company.  Based on the results demonstrated, TORIDOLL Holdings then decided to deploy the service at all Marugame  Udon noodle shops in Japan.  Incorporating AI and machine learning from data characteristics to imitate human thought processes, the  dynamic ensemble model can optimally combine multiple demand forecasting models using automatic tuning.  Fujitsu’s demand forecasting technology provides stable and highly accurate demand forecasts by leveraging a  learning model that accurately captures the characteristics of individual prediction objects that change  according to various factors including periodicities, external factors and trends. It will also promote the use of  forecast data in various planning operations including order placement, production planning, and work  scheduling.

To understand the mechanism behind  the development of cancer resistance, detailed data and new analysis methods are essential. Fujitsu has further  developed Explainable AI such as Wide Learning (*6), which explains the basis for decision making, and  Discovery AI which enables the discovery of unknown causal relationships.  One development challenge was to accelerate the speed of processing calculations for a comprehensive  search targeting all 20,000 human genes, which on a standard computer would take more than 4,000 years.  Fujitsu implemented parallel conditional and causal algorithms on the supercomputer Fugaku to maximize  computational performance so that all human genes could be analyzed in a reasonable timeframe. In addition,  technology was developed that used Discovery AI to extract in one day promising genetic combinations  causing conditions that might create drug resistance. This permitted high-speed calculation of conditional and  causal relationship data for the entire human genome within a single day, successfully identifying the genes  that caused resistance to lung cancer therapy drugs.  In future, Fujitsu will utilize the new technology to discover complex intersecting causes and resolve decision- making challenges in a variety of fields including marketing, system operations and manufacturing.        *5 Molecularly targeted drugs: Therapeutic drugs designed to act only on the molecule (protein, gene, etc.) causing the disease.  *6 Official website for Hello, Wide Learning!

However, the increased demand for EVs, resulting in a  greater load on the electricity network during  charging, has posed a challenge for energy suppliers,  and transport operators have struggled to control  charging-related CO2 emissions. Unless charging uses  green power, the impact of EVs on CO2 emissions  reduction is decreased.  In a digital collaboration initiative with the World  Business Council for Sustainable Development  (WBCSD), Dutch consulting firm Arcadis NV and British  electricity company National Grid plc, Fujitsu  demonstrated its Fleet Management Optimization (FMO) solution for maximizing delivery efficiency. The goal  was to reduce CO2 emissions from EV charging. Green power generation is subject to fluctuations due to  weather conditions. In this demonstration, focusing on charging during periods with an ample supply of green  power leads to reduced CO2 emissions and stability of the energy supply and demand balance. Simulation  analysis was performed using FMO with delivery EV data from Arcadis as well as data on the greenness of  electricity from National Grid. The results showed that by optimizing the charging schedule of delivery vehicles  for transport operators, CO2 emissions from charging could be reduced by 15%. Based on this demonstration,  Fujitsu is developing a Fleet CO2 Reduction solution, to support the use of green power for EV charging and  reducing CO2 emissions.

As part of our  activities to promote human rights and DE&I as key issues for globally responsible business, we have  established a structure of regular meetings for those responsible for promoting human rights in each of  Fujitsu’s operating regions. The Committee also works collaboratively with each of the Business Groups, the  Corporate Divisions and the regions to put in place actions that will address human rights issues throughout the  supply chain.          Promotion of Human Rights Due Diligence  In accordance with the ''Fujitsu Group Human Rights  Statement'', the Fujitsu Group is conducting “Human  Rights Due Diligence” that identifies the human rights  impacts of our business activities throughout the  entire global value chain, while also preventing or  mitigating any negative impacts.   The Human Rights Due Diligence process has four  continuous steps.  We conduct Human Rights Impact Assessment in  accordance with the Fujitsu Group Human Rights  Statement and implement measures to prevent or  mitigate clearly identified risks. We then regularly  monitor the progress of those measures to confirm  their effectiveness, and the results are disclosed via  reports or other information channels.  When a new corporate acquisition is made, we carry out due diligence with respect to sustainability, including  human rights. We also take steps to mitigate any risk of human rights violations and ensure that the Fujitsu  Group human rights initiatives are fully embraced.      Assessment of Human Rights Impacts  To ensure that the effectiveness of human rights due diligence is maximized in the Fujitsu Group, we conduct  regular Human Rights Impact Assessment.  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 56 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  5-1-1-3  © Fujitsu 2023  In 2022 we enlisted the cooperation of Business for Social Responsibility (BSR), an international NPO, which  undertook Human Rights Impact Assessment for Fujitsu Group management and businesses from a third-party  perspective. As well as conducting interviews with each of the Fujitsu Group regions, Corporate Divisions and  Business Groups, BSR employed desktop research(*2) and analysis of submitted documents to compile a list of  human rights issues. They then ranked the issues according to their levels of severity, likelihood and correlation  with businesses. The results identified human rights issues such as employees’ working environments,  workplace health and safety, the use of forced or child labor in supply chains, and data privacy and data  security in our businesses.  (*2) Desktop research:  A research method where data is gathered by referencing websites and other materials. In this instance, the research was  carried out based on materials presented by Fujitsu Business Groups, materials published by external sources, and other  materials issued by external organizations such as NGOs and NPOs.          Initiatives to Prevent or Mitigate Negative Human Rights Impacts  Supply Chain (Human Rights Issues: Supply Chain Working Environment,  Forced or Child Labor, High-risk Minerals)  The Fujitsu Group requires that all its suppliers support the Fujitsu Group Human Rights Statement. The Group  also requires them to support the prohibition of human trafficking, forced and child labor and discrimination, to  support freedom of association and collective bargaining rights, and to promote policies such as pay equity.  The human rights due diligence initiatives in the Fujitsu Group supply chain are based on the RBA Code of  Conduct.     Supply Chain    Structures for Promoting CSR Procurement  The Fujitsu Group embeds the RBA’s Code of Conduct and engages in socially responsible procurement with its  suppliers and throughout its supply chain.  We have formulated and made stakeholders aware of the Fujitsu Group’s CSR Procurement Guidelines, and we  request that suppliers fully understand and comply with that Guidelines. To keep track of the progress of those  initiatives, the Fujitsu Group conducts regular CSR surveys of its major overseas and domestic suppliers each  year. The FY2022 survey elicited responses from 533 companies. Feedback was actioned based on survey  results from 77 of Fujitsu's key suppliers of products and services, including product-related materials, catering,  security, and manufacturing employment agencies/subcontractors.    Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 57 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  5-1-1-4  © Fujitsu 2023  Initiatives to Prevent Forced Labor and Child Labor  The Fujitsu Group has stipulated that it prohibits the use of forced labor or child labor. The Fujitsu Group CSR  Procurement Guideline issued to suppliers includes demands that they eliminate forced labor and child labor,  and written surveys are used to check their progress with those initiatives.    Addressing High-Risk Minerals  The policy of the Fujitsu Group is to eliminate from its products, components and supply chain any minerals  that give rise to conflicts (“conflict minerals”), or minerals that are at high risk of being associated with forced  labor or human rights violations. To this end, the Fujitsu Group conducts surveys of high-risk minerals.     Addressing High-Risk Minerals    Employees (Human Rights Issues: Working Environment, Non-discrimination,  Equal Opportunity)  The Fujitsu Group takes the rights of all its employees very seriously and complies with the core labor standards  set out by the ILO. It also will not discriminate on the basis of race, skin color, religion, beliefs, gender, social  status, family origin, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity, birthplace, age, or any other factor that is  not related to legitimate business interests.     Diversity, Equity & Inclusion    Activities to Raise Awareness of Human Rights  The Fujitsu Group has established a Human Rights Promotion Committee, chaired by the executive responsible  for human resources, that leverages various opportunities to undertake research and awareness-raising  activities. Reports on the status of activities and issues within the areas in Japan and in group companies are  regularly provided to the secretariat of the Human Rights Promotion Committee. Findings are used by the  Human Rights Promotion Committee to summarize activities and set policy direction on an annual basis to  drive ongoing, structured educational activities that promote respect for human rights. We are also members  of the Industrial Federation for Human Rights, Tokyo, a voluntary organization, and work on mutual training with  many of the member enterprises to make respect for human rights an integral part of our corporate culture. In  addition, from our standpoint as a company, we engage in activities that work to raise community awareness.

In addition to the video message from the Chief  Sustainability Officer (CSuO), the GRB Director and  heads of business groups, we released a video  showing the results of the Fujitsu Group human rights  impact assessment. We also held webinars in English  and Japanese in three time zones in which we  discussed the importance for the company of respect  for human rights. For the webinars, we invited experts  on human rights from the external NPO BSR, along  with Fujitsu researchers working on AI ethics.                Working Environment  The Fujitsu Group aims to improve the work-life balance and productivity of every employee through a variety  of initiatives aimed at reducing long working hours. By promoting Work Life Shift, we are also enhancing our  systems that support diverse modes of employment based on teleworking, allowing employees to make use of  flexible working arrangements, such as flex time and exempt labor systems.     Social Well-being   Work Life Shift    Initiatives in other regions  UK: The UK has developed Work Your Way commitments which include a Well-being hour each week,  opportunity to work core hours, work from different countries for up to 4 weeks per year (subject to approval)  and protected focus time which gives people meeting-free focused time to get on with their work.

In FY2022, we conducted  surveys at 6 facilities and 79 global group companies to assess the progress of human rights and work practices  programs with the aim of identifying problems and helping to expand such programs company-wide. We also  conducted a survey of 21 overseas group companies in FY2020 investigating working hours, wages, privacy and  reporting systems.        Customers and End Users (Human Rights Issues: Privacy, Data Security,  Ethical Use of Technology)  Because the Fujitsu Group shoulders considerable responsibility as an IT developer and supplier, we devote a  great deal of effort to deepening our understanding of the potential negative impacts of the many and diverse  human rights issues entailed by advanced IT such as AI, and to minimizing those impacts. This applies to areas  such as data security, privacy protection, and the ethical use of data.    Initiatives on Ethical AI  The rapid progress of AI is resulting in dramatic changes to people’s lives and the communities in which they  live. While this innovative technology offers new solutions to social and environmental problems, it remains a  “black box” process where people do not understand how its outcomes are achieved. Another issue is that the  large volumes of data involved in that process can include inherent biases, which the technology encourages.  Even when care is taken with the use of AI, it can lead to unforeseen problems for people. There are reports of  cases of wrongful judgment due to misidentification by AI as well as ethical issues such as inequality of access,  which can erode people’s trust in AI. This is why the Fujitsu Group considers it an essential part of its  responsibility as an AI developer, supplier and operator to offer AI that is not only convenient, but also safe and  secure.  The Fujitsu Group has long advocated a ‘human centric’ approach and argued that information technology  should fundamentally be used to focus on, and to benefit, people. In March 2019, as a reflection of the rapid  recent development of AI technologies, the Fujitsu Group formulated and announced the ''Fujitsu Group AI  Commitment''. As one of the companies which carries out AI-related businesses including research,  development, implementation and operation activities, we aim to emphasize the importance of communication  with a wide range of stakeholders in the community, including users and consumers, as we distribute the  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 60 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  5-1-1-7  © Fujitsu 2023  enormous value of AI to the society. For that purpose, the commitment outlines our promises with the  customers and the community.     Fujitsu Group AI Commitment    The Fujitsu Group has identified the ethical risks listed below arising from the use of AI, and is formulating  mitigation measures to address emerging risks that could significantly impact our future business.    Details of emerging risks  Emerging Risks  The Ethical Risks of Utilizing AI  Description  As a company that has been researching, developing, providing, and  operating AI technologies since before the 1980s, Fujitsu has long  asserted that information technology must be used in a human- centered manner. In recent years, there have been reports of  troubling instances whereby ethical problems arise from the use of AI  in the handling of privacy information. Examples include  discrimination and unfairness due to negative judgments caused by  false recognition by AI. Such cases can undermine people’s trust in AI.  Fujitsu believes it is critical that those who develop, provide, and  operate AI technologies achieve not only convenience but also use  that is safe and secure.  Impact  As we see the widespread use of AI increasing with unprecedented  speed, particularly in the case of generative AI, there is also a risk that  users and consumers who have been inconvenienced by AI supplied  by Fujitsu may file claims for damages and thereby harm the Fujitsu  Group’s reputation. In addition, proposed AI regulation announced by  the European Commission (in June 2023) would require developers,  users, and others involved to take strict action based on the degree  of risk that their AI systems could adversely affect human rights.  Violations could result in penalties, including fines of up to 7% of  total global sales. This makes implementing appropriate risk  management in the development and operation of AI systems  essential.  Mitigating actions  The Company established the Fujitsu Group External Advisory  Committee on AI Ethics as a body that meets regularly and engages  in ongoing dialogue with stakeholders from society. Part of this  dialogue involves feedback on the “Fujitsu Group AI Commitment,”  which serves as the Group’s AI ethical guidelines. The Company also  participates in international discussions on AI ethics through its  membership in AI4People and other forums. By virtue of these risk  mitigating actions, the Fujitsu Group management and staff can  become aware of the ethical risks of AI and understand the  precautions needed when researching, developing, installing and  running AI. By minimizing the likelihood of situations that might cause  inconvenience to users and customers, we can foster people’s trust in  AI. In particular, with regard to proposed European AI regulations, the  Company has developed an “AI Ethical Impact Assessment” system  that comprehensively identifies potential risks in AI systems as a  proactive response to regulation violation risks and has released this  system free of charge.        Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 61 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  5-1-1-8  © Fujitsu 2023  Promotion and Practical Application of AI Ethics  As stipulated by the policies laid down in the Fujitsu Group AI Commitment, the Fujitsu Group conducts  education and training activities across the entire company and includes content that considers urgent and  specific issues in AI.  Because we believe it is crucial for a culture of understanding to be championed by senior management in  order to instill respect for human rights, the Fujitsu Group has set up the Fujitsu Group External Advisory  Committee on AI Ethics, which comprises external experts in the field, to objectively evaluate ethics as it is  practiced in the group. Discussions by this committee use a structure shared with the Board of Directors  Meeting, incorporating the group's efforts for AI ethics into its corporate governance framework and allowing  for ongoing review and improvement.

Working with these communities, we have established systems to engage in human rights-related  consultations and information gathering both inside and outside the company, in order to listen to and  understand the opinions of various parties.  The Fujitsu Group has created an intranet-based system to consult with and accept input from all Fujitsu Group  employees on human rights-related issues. Within Japan, Fujitsu has set up Human Rights Consultation Service  facilities in seven geographical areas. The matters discussed are reported to the Human Rights Promotion  Committee and regularly communicated to auditors, with careful consideration given to ensuring that personal  information and privacy are respected. The objectives are to understand the utilization status of this  consultation service and to put in place initiatives designed to prevent recurrences of any breaches.  Through the Compliance Line/Fujitsu Alert structure, the Fujitsu Group receives reports and offers consultations  related to compliance issues, including human rights issues, for all Fujitsu Group employees, customers,  suppliers and other third parties globally. The Fujitsu Group has also set up the Compliance Line for Suppliers in  Japan as a channel for receiving reports from suppliers in Japan regarding any actions that are potential or  actual instances of non-compliance in our purchasing activities.

At present, alcohol sales in the UK require sales staff to check the age of their customers. As well as being  time-consuming and costly, this approach is also vulnerable to the use of false or borrowed IDs.  The DPoA Solution uses two factors to resolve this problem. The first is a function that anonymously confirms  the purchaser’s age at the time of purchase, and the second demonstrates the purchaser’s age to retail outlet  staff using the age recorded in the purchaser’s mobile phone. This solution offers greater convenience because  people purchasing alcohol no longer have to wait for a staff member. It is also expected to improve retail outlet  productivity and reduce costs. But its most important benefit is that it offers greater safety. As well as  protecting children, this technology solution can also prevent the violence that sales staff often face when  required to check people’s age.     Fujitsu Digital Age Assurance    Working with the Aboriginal Community of  Cherbourg in Australia  Working with the Cherbourg Aboriginal Shire Council,  the Queensland Government’s Department of  Tourism, Innovation and Sport and TAFE (Technical  and Further Education) Queensland, in April 2022  Fujitsu Australia established the First Nations Service  Centre (FNSS) to support digital innovation by the  aboriginal community in Cherbourg.  Since the arrival of the first European settlers,  aboriginal communities in Cherbourg, Australia have  endured a tragic past involving enslavement and  attempted genocide. Deprived of the benefits of  modern-day science and technology and overlooked  in terms of education, economic progress and digital  inclusion, Cherbourg’s First Nations people have  struggled to cross the digital divide that lies between  many of Australia’s rural towns and its cities.

Until recently, the only way for locals to access modern technical education or a career was to leave the  regional community, which was far from ideal for a people who have such important ties to their culture. Fujitsu  Australia worked with the Cherbourg Aboriginal Shire Council, Deadly Innovation, TAFE Queensland and  Australia Post to open the Cherbourg Digital Service Centre, a commercially viable initiative to boost the  Community’s economy and digital inclusion.  Fujitsu now subcontracts to the Centre, employing locals as service desk representatives who are offered  quality technical education through TAFE, improving their ICT skills and providing opportunities for  employment and decent jobs. New and upgraded infrastructure was also installed in Cherbourg to support the  Community’s economic development and digital access.    The community was consulted throughout to discuss the role of Fujitsu in achieving the  community’s goals.  All Fujitsu staff involved with the project underwent cultural competency training to strengthen trust between  the Service Centre and the Fujitsu team members.     Australia Post: Driving digital inclusion in First Nations Communities    Event Held in Cambodia to Raise Awareness of Children’s Safety  Fujitsu collaborated in conducting a workshop that  included lectures highlighting ways to protect  Cambodian children from harmful online content and  how to safely access online culture and games.  The workshop dealt with a range of cultures and had  particular pointers for children on how to  communicate safely online, including the importance  of not sharing certain images, not oversharing  personal details and what constitutes personal  information. It also stressed the importance of taking  care while online and provided information on the  sorts of places where harmful content appears as well  as how to respond when confronted by such content.              Collaboration with Malaysian Technology- Oriented Comprehensive Rehabilitation  Facility  Fujitsu Malaysia (Fujitsu (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd.), in a co- creation program with Malaysia’s Social Security  Organization (SOCSO), has developed the Automated  Self-Ordering Food System as a way to help improve  patients’ health.  SOCSO plays a critical role in providing social security  protection to workers in Malaysia. SOCSO also helps to  lessen the impact of job losses by providing financial  assistance and job training to eligible workers who  have been affected by work-related injuries or  illnesses.  The SOCSO Rehabilitation Centre is a medical facility that provides rehabilitation services to workers who have  suffered work-related injuries or illnesses.

In 2022, we revamped the Global DE&I Vision & Inclusion Wheel to create an equitable and more inclusive  culture where everyone belongs and can be completely themselves. Equity, as expressed in the new vision, is  intended to recognize and respond to the fact that all people are in different circumstances and will require a  variety of resources and opportunities depending on their circumstances, as opposed to equality, which  provides the same things equally to everyone. Through this more inclusive and holistic approach to DE&I, we  aim to achieve a sustainable society, looking not only at our own business, but also at the positive impact our  technologies and solutions have on society.          Promotion Framework for DE&I  Here at Fujitsu, we established an office to promote diversity in 2008. The office, which is under the direction of  the President and the Diversity Officer, engages in efforts to promote DE&I in all Group companies.  The office hosts regular meetings, attended by all regional DE&I Promotion Representatives, for them to share  information on issues and measures in each region and engage in planning for globally coordinated promotion  measures. In order to have an awareness of the current state of diversity promotion, we also include questions  on DE&I in our annual global engagement survey. In addition, executive sponsors have been appointed to  represent supporters in each of the priority areas, and support the promotion measures in each area.  All domestic group companies in Japan are also required to select a diversity promotion manager. These  managers promote DE&I in the Group as a whole by sharing information amongst each other during their  meetings, strengthening their coordination with Fujitsu, helping standardize policies, and more.  Furthermore, from FY2020, the system will be designed to allow higher-level executives to include DE&I-related  items in their goals.

Held on the  same day to enable participation from various regions, the event  featured a “dialogue session between the President, DE&I Officer,  and CSuO and employees” and the “sharing of good practices by  employees and workplaces” that were conducted globally.  Each region is working to comprehensively promote DE&I, with  East Asia holding Human Rights and DE&I Week, Europe (CEE area)  holding the intercultural awareness session “Working with Japanese  Employees,” and Europe (NWE area) holding Inclusion Week 2022.    Initiatives Related to Unconscious Bias  In FY2022, the Fujitsu Group created and rolled out video content worldwide to better deal with unconscious  bias and improve communication. The content is designed to help employees recognize their own unconscious  bias and create inclusive workplaces that embrace diversity through dialogue with case studies by outside  lecturers.        Europe and Global Delivery have collaborated on new training to understand unconscious bias and to make  inclusion conscious in order to address this bias.      Endorsement of International Standards  In FY2017, the Fujitsu Group issued a CEO Statement of Support for the Women’s Empowerment Principles,  which were created by the UN Global Compact and UN Women. In doing so, we pledged our support of the  principles. In FY2018, we also became the first Japanese company to pledge our support to the UN’s LGBTI  Standards of Conduct for business, and have been proactive overall in our adaptation to global trends in  diversity.

In addition to these kinds of  management-track leadership programs, we also  conduct workshops and events that allow female  employees to reflect and build on their careers in all  other tracks as well. These expand and act as pipelines to drive female employees to further advancement, and  allow us to support the careers of each and every employee. Strategic measures are being boldly implemented  in other regions, as well, according to the situation of the region and the country.    Career Workshop for Female Employees  Fujitsu and its domestic Group companies host workshops that are primarily for female employees that are on a  leadership track, where awareness-raising by external lecturers, dialogues with multiple role models, and  discussions with executive personnel are held, with the goal of further encouraging the career development of  female employees. Our goal with this workshop, which is completely voluntary-participation based, is to help  eliminate any internalized prejudice as to their manager-level career development, expand their career options,  acquire the broader perspective needed to perform in high-level positions, and develop a sense of ownership  over their careers.    International Women’s Day Initiatives  The Fujitsu Group uses the occasion of International Women’s Day, which falls on March 8 each year, as an  opportunity to communicate messages from top management and promote the event outside the company  through social media. In addition, we use green, the theme color of gender at the Fujitsu Group, to build a  sense of unity and cohesion within the group, while accelerating the transformation of corporate culture by  holding various events such as Webinars and lectures in each region. Furthermore, since FY2018, Fujitsu and its  domestic Group companies have been hosting lectures and networking events by guests from inside and  outside Fujitsu, and other regions have also been implementing events and measures to make this International  Women’s Day an important opportunity in the area of gender.  In FY2022, Fujitsu implemented various initiatives in conjunction with its “Thanks Project,” which is aimed at  encouraging employees to express their gratitude to each other more than ever amid changing work styles,  and to make this a part of the company’s culture.    Other Initiatives  In the Americas region, the Women’s Innovative Network (WIN) offered a series sharing challenges and  successes. East Asia and APAC (ASEAN and India) hosted online coffee table dialogues during Asia Human  Rights and DE&I Week. Two guest female leaders offered advice to female employees. Europe and Global  Delivery celebrated International Men’s Day on November 19, providing an opportunity to understand DE&I  concerning men and achieve it. Europe (NWE area) and Global Delivery are working on a gender pay cap  program. Fujitsu Germany hosted a German Girl’s Day event, giving female students the opportunity to  experience AI. Global Delivery offers INSPIRE, a learning and mentoring program focused on women leaders.    ★Indicator assured by third party  ★  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 69 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC    5-1-2-5  © Fujitsu 2023        Initiatives for Health, Disability and Accessibility  At Fujitsu, we do not impose restrictions on the types  of jobs available to people with disabilities. As such,  there are people with disabilities who work in a wide  range of jobs, from sales staff to SEs, R&D staff,  administrative staff, and more.  During the hiring process, we prepare pamphlets and  websites aimed toward job seekers with disabilities.  This pamphlet includes employee interviews, as well  as information as to our stance on the employment of  people with disabilities, and the wide range of jobs  available to them. In explaining how we provide an  affirming and individually oriented workplace for all,  regardless of disability, we hope to relieve them of any  anxiety they may have about their employment. We  also conduct long-term follow-up on these employees, from training until they become settled in their jobs, to  encourage them to stay with us for the long term.   Examples of this include special training programs when they enter the company, and workplace-oriented  consultations so that each employee is able to perform to the best of their abilities.  We also created a manual for workplaces, called the Work Style Guideline. It lists the things that employees  should consider when working with employees with disabilities, according to each type of disability, to help  understanding in the workplace.  In addition, we introduced a diversity communication tool—FUJITSU Software LiveTalk—as a common service  for Fujitsu and its domestic Group companies, in order to support smooth communication and efficient  operations which include employees who are hearing-impaired. We are implementing strategic measures such  as hiring, accessibility improvements, and employee network activities in other regions, as well, according to  the situation of the region and the country.     FUJITSU Software LiveTalk    Initiatives on the International Day of Persons with Disabilities  On December 3, the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, we used purple, the Fujitsu Group's theme  color for health and disability, to create a sense of unity within the Group, and delivered messages from top  management. We are working together with DE&I promotion teams and employee network groups in each  region to raise awareness of disabilities by holding events such as webinars and roundtables which promote  understanding for people with disabilities, as well as conducting various initiatives that are aimed at boosting  employee awareness.    Employee Network Groups of Employees with Disabilities  The Fujitsu Group has employee network groups of disabilities in each region. With the support of a global  execctive sponsors, they are working to promote understanding of disabilities and create an inclusive  environment while forming a global network (Global Network of Persons with Disabilities).

These subsidiaries work to cater to the unique needs of  each and every individual, and create workplaces where they can thrive.    Initiatives in Other Regions  In certain regions, employees who promote DE&I are providing support for the Human Resources Department  and reforming internal regulations and hiring practices, in order to build a workplace that is more inclusive for  people with disabilities. Fujitsu has created a system for interviewing people with disabilities about their  support needs on a voluntary and confidential basis. By improving the workplace through these initiatives, we  will further improve the inclusion of people with disabilities.

Fujitsu Thailand, Fujitsu Vietnam,  Fujitsu Indonesia, and Fujitsu Singapore donated funds and scholarships to support children with disabilities and  those who lack access to education, technology, and employment opportunities.            Initiatives for Culture and Ethnicity  The Fujitsu Group is moving forward with efforts to create a corporate culture which treats people from diverse  racial and ethnic backgrounds with respect. We are launching activities related to ethnicity and culture on a  global scale. Various events are held in each region, such as employee network group activities to understand  diverse cultures and ethnic groups, events to understand national and regional cultures, activities to provide a  deeper understanding of specific ethnic groups, and activities to support ethnic minorities.  Fujitsu UK voluntarily published the ethnicity pay gap from 2021 to strengthen racial equality. Black Employee  Inclusion Network Group (BEING) in the Americas region provided cultural education through Black History  Month celebrations and partnerships with non-profit organizations. BEING also obtained funds from the Fujitsu  Group’s Strategic Community Investment 2022 program for promoting careers in STEM fields among young  people. Fujitsu Australia has established an Indigenous-operated digital service center in Cherbourg, Australia  (First Nations Service Centre), employing eight people and helping them develop their careers through training  and support. The Fujitsu New Zealand Legal & Compliance Team was selected as a finalist for the D&I Initiative  of the Year Award at the New Zealand Law Awards for its Māori and Pacific Peoples Inclusion Plan.  In addition, we, at Fujitsu, hire global personnel, including international students and students from overseas  universities, by participating career events and holding in-house seminars for international students in and  outside Japan. As a result, we have employed 674 foreign nationals at Fujitsu as of the end of FY2022. To help  international employees integrate into Fujitsu’s organizational environment and life in Japan, we have  implemented a mentoring program, internal recommendations to promote the use of both Japanese and  English for internal information and information sharing through our intranet site and internal social media. The  English Club, a voluntary employees’ network group established in Japan in which employees communicate in  English, has developed into a lively exchange activity with participants from other regions joining its online  activities, adding vitality to cross-cultural understanding.

To create an  environment where everyone can work comfortably  and fully demonstrate their abilities, we are promoting  efforts to deepen understanding of gender diversity  while continuously communicating messages from  management to all employees.  In Japan, we are also expanding the scope of  application of our internal systems, such as  congratulatory and condolence payments, vacation  days, and leaves of absence, to include same-sex  partners as well. We also take into consideration the  use of preferred names based on gender identity and  other efforts in order to create a support work  environment.  Our efforts to raise awareness across the entire company include providing training on human rights, hosting  lectures, and sending out messages through the intranet. In addition, we also host LGBTI+ Ally Meetings, where  employees can engage in discussions with a diverse range of LGBTI+ individuals, in order to expand the network  of LGBTI+ allies. Since 2017, we have hosted screening events under the theme of LGBTI+ and LGBTI+ allyship  (2017: The Case Against 8 / 2018: Kalanchoe / 2021 and 2022: I am what I am. – Over the Rainbow – / 2022: I  am Here – We Live Together). In recent years, participants of these events have started to naturally declare  their LGBTI+ allyship in the workplace, by using rainbow-colored backgrounds for online meetings.  We are also committed to activities that contribute to the creation of a diverse and sustainable society. We are  a partner in Pride House Tokyo (*1), a project that aims to create a permanent place where the next generation  of LGBTQ youth can gather in safety and security, and where organizations, individuals, and businesses across  different sectors work together to disseminate information about sexual minorities. In recognition of these  efforts, the company received the highest “Gold” rating in the PRIDE Index by the voluntary organization “work  with Pride.”    (*1) Pride House Tokyo : Japanese language                 English language    The Americas region installed restrooms for all genders and celebrated four pride (Policies on LGBTI+) events  focusing on transgender people.

Fujitsu Pride   Fujitsu Pride is a movement at the Fujitsu Group where representatives from employee  network groups of LGBTI+ people and allies from each region come together to collaborate  and take action on a global scale with the support of executive sponsors. Since 2020, we  have held the first-ever online ''Global Fujitsu Virtual Pride Week,'' hosted by Fujitsu Pride.  Executives and employees from Fujitsu and group companies in Japan and overseas  participate, and activities such as virtual parades, online seminars, panel discussions, and  small group events to discuss LGBTI+ issues are conducted.          Initiatives for Inter-generations  The Fujitsu Group strives for a corporate culture where all group ages should feel respected and that they have  opportunities to succeed.  As part of this effort, Fujitsu set up a dialogue forum for employees across generations to deepen mutual  understanding as they discussed their values and job satisfaction.        The Americas region has a networking group of employees who were in the armed forces. Fujitsu Vietnam  encouraged employees who were in the armed forces by donating gifts and donations to wounded and ill  veterans. Global Delivery hosted a Webinar for the sandwich generation (the generation that needs to care for  older family members and their children). Various other initiatives are also underway in each region.      Support of a Healthy Work-Life Balance  Fujitsu is moving forward with efforts to establish systems that will allow employees to better balance their  work and private life, including such events as childbirth, childcare, and long-term care. In addition to  introducing and mainstreaming remote work, we are promoting a balance between work and childcare and  long-term care by overhauling work systems, such as expanding ''flex time'' work setups without core work  hours, and increasing the number of days men can take our unique parental leave.    Childbirth and Childcare  Fujitsu has established an Action Plan (*2) in accordance with the Act on Advancement of Measures to Support  Raising Next-Generation Children. We also provide babysitter subsidies and have in-house childcare facilities in  our business offices. Several times a year, we also conduct seminars for employees who have just returned from  parental leave, as well as seminars for supervisors of employees who are on parental leave, with the aim of  Dialogue forum for employees across generations  Common global logo  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 74 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC    5-1-2-10  © Fujitsu 2023  providing workplace support and constructing networks, in addition to promoting diversity management.  Furthermore, in addition to support seminars for employees who are about to take maternity or childcare leave,  we also hold seminars for employees who are thinking about their career plans based on taking maternity or  childcare leave in the future, employees whose spouses are about to have a baby, and supervisors who have  such employees under their supervision, to fully support them in balancing work and childcare.    (*2)  Action Plan: The first Action Plan was implemented in 2005. This current one is the 7th Action Plan (April 1, 2021 – March 31,  2024).     7th Action Plan (61.6KB)    Nursing Care  Since FY2017, we have also hosted the Balancing Work and Nursing Care seminar for employees involved in  nursing care. The seminar provides an opportunity to learn basic knowledge about nursing care in general,  including support policies both inside and outside of the company, the mental/emotional attitude needed, and  the preparation that goes into providing nursing care. In addition, in FY2020, we released a handbook which  compiles information about knowledge and behavior to keep in mind for each stage of care, as well as the  company systems available for use, with the goal of having employees use them to balance work and nursing  care. Furthermore, in conjunction with CareNet, Inc., a Fujitsu Group company that offers nursing care services,  we launched a Nursing Care Consultation Service, and are aiming to realize employee wellbeing by addressing  the nursing care worries of each employee across the entire Fujitsu Group.

So that we can achieve a sustainable world, Fujitsu is focusing on  creating an organization that brings together a diverse group of people with expertise and experience,  leveraging the technology areas in which the company has always excelled. In addition, to support each  employee's autonomous learning and growth rather than providing uniform training from the company, we  offer a wide range of learning and career options based on common global policies. We support employees to  become their desired selves by revising systems, promoting reskilling and upskilling in accordance with the  transformation of our business portfolio, and provide an environment that enables each employee to act  autonomously with a sense of fulfillment emphasizing improvements in employees’ sense of job satisfaction  and engagement.      To Achieve Career Ownership  From April 2022, we have introduced a new personnel system based on the concept of ‘job-based human  resource management’ that encourages each employee to take on challenges and grow with in our domestic  Group. In line with this, we are implementing measures focused on each individual to support employees in  taking on challenges and growing based on their career ownership.  In order to realize our purpose, Fujitsu has shifted its relationship with employees to one that fosters autonomy  and trust while realizing mutual growth, and it has completely revamped its human resources and personnel  training system, which now focus on job-based human resources management that supports employees to  tackle new challenges. The collection of programs that supports employee career ownership is now named  FUJITSU Career Ownership Program (FCOP) to reflect the company’s efforts to cultivate career ownership  among all employees.   The program offers streamlined career development opportunities, including Understanding and Promotion of  Career Ownership aimed at understanding one’s own career phase through career ownership diagnosis and  age-specific workshops, Career Interviews that provide one-on-one interview opportunities with a career  counsellor or a supervisor, Learning Opportunities that allow employees to learn a multitude of content both  relevant to and outside of work anytime anywhere through a learning platform, and Opportunities to Take  Challenges that enables employees to apply for transfer or promotion to a position they aspire to within the  Fujitsu Group through the global internal job posting system. Through these opportunities, FUJITSU aims to  growth together with its employees while realizing its purpose based on an autonomous and trusting  relationship between employees and the company serving as the foundation.

Through various initiatives, we support the realization of Fujitsu Uvance and our  purpose from a human resource perspective.    Fujitsu Innovation Circuit  The Fujitsu Innovation Circuit aims to enable us to become a company where anyone can take on challenges,  where conversations about what has been learned from challenges and support for those taking on  challenges are commonplace, and where intrapreneurs (internal entrepreneurs) are born to lead Fujitsu into  the future and realize the world we aim to create with Uvance.   Under the full supervision of Yasuhiro Yamakawa, Associate Professor of Entrepreneurship at Babson College  in the US, the Academy and Challenge stage, which began in November 2021, fosters intrapreneurs through  learning and practice of entrepreneurship. By the third iteration, 571 people have participated and acquired  the corporate know-how and mindset. Moreover, we established the Growth Program in July 2022 as a  practical program that incubates high potential projects among business ideas derived from the Challenge  Program. In FY2022, there were a total of seven projects promoted.

Recognized as the pinnacle of Fujitsu Group engineers by common global standards, they  participate in the formulation of our business and technology strategies.   We have established the seven certification areas of networks, cybersecurity, AI, data, computing, hybrid IT  and project management, which are the future key technology areas of our new business. As of FY2022, a  total of 33 Global FDEs were certified.   Furthermore, we will position it as a benefit and career path for engineers who contribute to business  strategy and customer value creation in conjunction with a job-based personnel system.      Reskilling  Fujitsu offers a reskilling program based on the skill level of individual employees in order to strengthen the  workforce for expanding the Business Application business, which is one of the key focus areas for  developing a technological foundation to address cross-industry challenges within Fujitsu Uvance.   One of the programs offered is the Global Strategic Partner Academy. This program is Fujitsu’s strategic  technology partner, which is implemented through collaboration between ServiceNow, Inc., SAP SE, and  Microsoft Corporation, the world’s top IT service providers. It has been rolled out globally as a universal  program, allowing learners to acquire knowledge and skills of the three companies’ services, as well as  cutting edge digital technology and know-how. The aim of the program is to increase the number of  personnel with highly specialized knowledge and know-how. Starting in December 2021, Fujitsu has been  offering highly specialized IT services to its customers thanks to the 57 employees who have completed this  program to date. We aim to invest in human resources over the long-term to achieve a sustainable society  through technological innovation. At the same time, we aspire to create an environment where anyone can  take on digital related job duties and work together with partner businesses and customers in maximizing  the potential of digital technology. We will aid in addressing challenges faced by customers and society by  strengthening global collaboration with human resources that excel in digital technology.      Initiatives Supporting Career Ownership  We are supporting the growth of our people by providing multiple options in career development and training  to empower them to take actions towards reaching specific career goals.    FUJITSU Career Ownership Program (FCOP)  We offer the FUJITSU Career Ownership Program (FCOP) as a support program to help each Fujitsu  employee take career ownership and realize their career goals. We host Career Café as a practical workshop  centered on dialogue, providing participants of the same generation with the opportunity to share ideas with  one another and receive new career inspiration. Employees can also use career ownership diagnosis as a tool  to understand where they stand in terms of career ownership. The tool contains 16 simple questions that  provide insight into an employee’s current career ownership status and actionable tips. The accumulated  statistical data serves as an important tool for visualizing and utilizing human capital data to better  understand career autonomy and challenges faced by the organization.   Furthermore, we offer expanded career interviews with in-house career counselors to provide a third-party  perspective for employees to thrive and actively participate at work in their own unique ways. In-house  career counselors are staffed by managers with job experience. Over 1,000 employees have sought advice to  help achieve their desired goals.

At Fujitsu, we focus on the individual purposes of employees and in less than two years since  the program's inception, we have carved out ''My Purpose'' among more than half of our employees,  approximately 70,000 people. The program has become an engine that drives our digital transformation. As  it shows a growing correlation with personal, organizational and corporate transformation, Fujitsu is also  considering expanding the program as an organizational transformation service program available to  external parties.        Promotion Structure  We are building a system to promote human resource development measures in a globally integrated manner  in order to realize our purpose. The Engagement & Growth Division is in charge of human resource  development in line with company-wide management policies, while the Human Resources Development  division in each business unit is responsible for human resource development in line with divisional strategies  and business needs, and clarifies human resources and skills to be strengthened and plans training measures. In  October 2022, the Skill Ownership Office (SOO) was established as an organization dedicated to employees’  skill development. The office consolidates the reskilling and upskilling opportunities across the company to  promote human resources capable of leading Fujitsu’s business globally, with the aim of achieving Fujitsu  Uvance. In addition, we are promoting knowledge sharing on a global basis in cooperation with the human  resource development departments in each region, and supporting all employees to learn and grow through a  combination of region-specific and local measures.  The execution of highly specialized training and education is handled by Fujitsu Learning Media Limited, a  Group company that provides human resource development services.      Main Initiatives of Each Region   Employee Support Workshop in Global Delivery  In 2022, a workshop targeting incumbent, new and future managers was launched in the second quarter in  Global Delivery, which received positive feedback from participants. To date, a total of six training sessions led  by global trainers have been held, with over 100 employees participating in each session. The training covered  themes including advice on self-care for managers, staff management in stressful situations, improvement of  empathy, unconscious bias, and principles of time management.

The goals of the workshop are  to enhance employees’ well-being and work-life balance, as well as to increase  their work engagement.

In April  2020, we introduced job descriptions for manager  positions that clearly outlined their jobs. This is now  being extended to non-managers, starting in April  2022. This new system uses a globally unified standard  to rate the magnitude and importance of the job, not  the person, and the compensation reflects this rating.  In April 2023, we lifted our average monthly wage in  Japan by approximately 10%. To attract and retain  diverse and talented employees, we are also reviewing  our compensation levels to ensure they are  competitive in terms of global corporate benchmarks.  The goal of these measures is to encourage every one  of our employees to be highly motivated as they rise  to the challenge of value creation and to spur their  growth as we address the constantly changing issues  faced by our customers and by the wider community.  In line with this, we are significantly extending our  posting structure so that employees can gain entry into their desired jobs and positions based on their own  career goals, rather than being promoted or transferred at the recommendation of their superiors. At the same  time, we are also recruiting suitable candidates from outside the company, not just from within our own ranks,  and adopting career promotions based on an approach of matching the right talent with the right job.  As well as having a quantitative perspective, such as sales numbers or the magnitude and importance of the  job (responsibility), these jobs are also rated based on perspectives such as the reporting line, difficulty, impact,  level of specialization and diversity. This is referred to as the “FUJITSU Level”, and in this structure, the monthly  salary is determined by the FUJITSU Level.  For FUJITSU Level 15 positions and below, bonuses are paid based on evaluations. For executive positions of VP  and higher, an STI(*1)/LTI(*2) scheme is being introduced that is more closely tied to results. This scheme will  also apply to executives both in Japan and overseas.    (*1) Short Term Incentive: Remuneration set based on level of achievement of one-year performance targets, etc.  (*2) Long Term Incentive: Remuneration set based on level of achievement of medium-to-long-term performance targets, etc.  Financial Well-being  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 89 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC    5-2-3-2  © Fujitsu 2023  Introduction of a Global Common Evaluation System  As part of our global common evaluation system, we  introduced “Executive Performance Management” for  executives in FUJITSU Level VP positions and above as  well as the “Connect” system for all employees in  FUJITSU Level 15 positions and below. These  evaluation systems were introduced with the aim of  spurring greater ambition among all our employees  and promoting both organizational and personal  growth. To achieve this, we began by drafting a  “Organization’s Vision” that depicts the future to be  achieved by each organization as we strive to realize  Fujitsu’s purpose, bringing employees closer to that  purpose and encouraging each of them to rise to the  challenge. We also made this one of the criteria for  assessing the extent to which we embody the “Our  Values” in the Fujitsu Way, thereby helping change  behaviors in line with achieving our purpose.   Our Executive Performance Management employs the  “Balanced Scorecard” method, which involves  evaluation from the perspective of “financial  indicators”, “key indicators” and “behavioral indicators”.  Rather than being based solely on financial indicators,  evaluations are well balanced, using a framework of  key indicators and behavioral indicators as well as  initiatives related to materiality and non-financial  indicators, such as employee engagement, customer  NPS, and the percentage of women in leadership roles.  In the “Connect” system, employees are assessed on their “Impact”, “Behaviours” and “Learning & Growth”  relative to achieving each organization’s vision and Fujitsu’s purpose. (See figure at right.)  Feedback is provided through regular communication on a monthly or quarterly basis between managers and  members, which maximizes behavioral change, growth and impact and also builds trusted relationships that  help to improve acceptance of the evaluations. Evaluation results not only feed into bonuses, but are also used  by the organization’s personnel management to assign higher levels of responsibility and opportunities for  growth to highly evaluated employees.      Employee Benefits Program  The Fujitsu Group has programs in place that are suited to the lifestyles of employees and their families and are  designed to enable them to achieve a sense of well-being.  As part of the trend toward more diverse and flexible ways of working, and to allow employees to make their  own choices, Fujitsu introduced the ”F Life+” cafeteria plan(*3). In line with the belief that active work,  challenges and personal growth for every employee will lead to growth and development for the company, we  have established various incentives to provide medium- to long-term motivation. These include a defined  contribution pension plan, an employee shareholding association, a property accumulation savings plan, and  group insurance benefits. Additional programs implemented by Fujitsu provide support in the areas of housing,  medical care, healthcare, and childcare and nursing.    (*3) Cafeteria plan: A system under which employees select the employee benefits they want or need from a diverse menu  prepared by the company, taking advantage of the chosen options by using ''employee benefits points'' awarded by the  company.

We therefore implemented a universal accident  insurance scheme for all Fujitsu employees working in  Germany. Since August 2022, even for private  accidents, all staff have enjoyed 24-hour,  omnidirectional accident coverage.          Cherbourg Digital Service Centre in Australia  Working with the Cherbourg Aboriginal Shire Council  and local community, the Queensland Government’s  Department of Tourism, Innovation and Sport and  TAFE Queensland, Fujitsu Australia established the First  Nations Service Centre to support digital innovation in  the Cherbourg community. The service center (located  in an aboriginal community in Wakka Wakka Country,  260 kilometers northwest of Brisbane) is part of a  three-year pilot program designed to promote  economic development in Queensland’s indigenous  communities through training in digital skills and by  providing employment opportunities.

Work Life Shift is a concept that achieves employee Well-being by focusing not only on ‘work’, but by  completely shifting the ‘job’ and the ‘lifestyle’.  We are implementing various initiatives, both in terms of personnel systems and workplace environment  changes, that will allow us to create and deliver value for our customers regardless of location or time and that  will enable the ongoing transformation of Fujitsu itself.  The Work Life Shift offering consists of three key categories: Smart Working, Borderless Office, and Culture  Change.    Smart Working  Approximately 80,000 employees of Fujitsu Group companies in Japan work principally on a teleworking basis  (excluding those in manufacturing facilities and those assigned to customer sites). Our employees enjoy an  optimal work style that allows them to choose flexible working hours and a work location that suit the  characteristics and objectives of their work tasks as well as their lifestyle.    Borderless Office  Freed from the constraints of working in a traditional fixed workplace, employees can select a location that  ideally matches the required task – be it their home, a hub office, a satellite office, or other appropriate  workspace.    Culture Change  People management founded on high levels of employee autonomy and trust will generate maximized team  performance and enhanced productivity.    Announcing Work Life Shift 2.0 -- DX Company Work Styles that Cater to  Everyone’s Well-being  In October 2021, Fujitsu announced Work Life Shift 2.0 as a way to achieve a true hybrid work style that  includes the effective use of real communication in the office and also aims to provide workers a more fulfilled  life. The new version puts in place more advanced measures that reflect both employee feedback and issues  that arose when the original Work Life Shift was implemented.    1. Practical Hybrid Work and the Evolution to “Experience Place”  As we look towards a post-COVID future, the office is evolving from the work place of the past to an  “experience place” that offers experiences only available at the office. New ways of using the office provide  greater collaboration through real communication as we transition to a true hybrid work style that combines  the real with the virtual.    2. Evolution of Work Styles for a DX Corporation  At Fujitsu, we are making the value of the various experiences gained from putting hybrid work into practice  visible as data as we move towards a work style that boosts productivity while allowing for greater creativity.  We are also further stepping up our collaborations with other corporations and local governments who support  Social Well-being  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 92 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC    5-2-4-2  © Fujitsu 2023  the Work Life Shift concept and contributing to the resolution of problems for our customers and the  community more broadly.    3. Enabling Work-Life Synergies  By leveraging flexible work styles to make workers’ home lives more fulfilling, we are generating synergies and  promoting new value creation, as well as achieving greater engagement and improving the wellbeing of all our  employees.    Fujitsu Telework System  In April 2017, Fujitsu formally introduced a telework system that allows for flexible ways of working that are not  tied to a specific location. This system is available to all 35,000 Fujitsu parent company employees in Japan and  includes working from home or a satellite office as well as working during business trips.  The telework system facilitates business continuity in emergency situations such as the spread of infectious  diseases and during natural disasters, providing for work innovations such as holding online meetings and  digitizing written materials. It also provides an environment that makes it easier for employees with other  commitments, such as raising children or caring for relatives, to continue working, helping Fujitsu to support  and retain valuable personnel.    Goals of the System     To boost individual productivity and maximize the benefits of team work   To build an environment that supports continued participation by a diverse range of staff   To ensure business continuity and rapid responses to disasters    Initiatives Aimed at Reducing Long Working Hours  The Fujitsu Group aims to improve the work-life balance and the productivity of every employee through a  variety of initiatives aimed at reducing long working hours. By promoting Work Life Shift, we are also enhancing  our systems that support diverse modes of employment based on tele-working, allowing employees to make  use of flexible working arrangements, such as flex time and exempt labor systems.    Examples of specific initiatives aimed at reducing long working hours:     Adopting flex time that is not tied to a core time and exempt labor systems for professional and  management-related work   Sending alert e-mails regarding overtime work   Specifying recommended days for taking annual leave   Emphasizing the concept of working hours management during management training   Adjusting work patterns and leisure patterns according to fluctuations in workload    Support of a Healthy Work-Life Balance  Fujitsu and its domestic Group companies aim to generate new forms of value through Work-Life Synergies. We  support each employee’s efforts to enrich their career with initiatives in areas such as childcare and nursing  care.    1. Childcare   Childbirth/childcare support leave (spouse or partner is entitled to 20 days of leave within 8 weeks before  or after birth)   Use of annual leave is permitted during childcare leave   Child illness/injury leave (up to March 31 in Year 6 of elementary school)   Childcare reduced working hours system (up to March 31 in Year 6 of elementary school; can reduce by a  maximum of 2 hours per day)   Establishment of corporate childcare centers  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 93 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC    5-2-4-3  © Fujitsu 2023   Subsidies for babysitting service expenses  2. Nursing care   Leave for nursing care and preparing for nursing care   Nursing care reduced working hours system   Remote work   Establishment of a contact point for advice    VOICE Program  The Fujitsu Group launched the VOICE Program in October 2020, as a project to ''not only listen indirectly to  customers' ‘voices’, but also listen more directly and more often'' as well as to ''directly link the opinions of the  Fujitsu Group’s 130,000 employees to management''. The concept of VOICE is symbolized by the slogan  ''change one's voice into a force and create a wind of change''. This is an activity that aims to heighten corporate  competitiveness by collecting the ‘voices’ of customers and employees and – by using them to speed up  decision-making in business activities – thereby change behavior, raise awareness, and generate encounters.   As part of efforts to enhance the workplace environment, we periodically conduct surveys related to Work Life  Shift and the results are reflected in a range of measures that leverage the VOICE program, such as business  process reforms and the review of systems and operations. This leads to improvements in employee experience  and employee engagement.      Measures to Enhance Communication  Labor Relations  Fujitsu has a union shop agreement with the Fujitsu Labor Union, Based on the union agreement, we hold  discussions about various employment conditions and explains management policies and business conditions,  along with business reorganization and other matters, to its employees through regular and ad hoc meetings  such as the Labor Council or Productivity Council. These agreements also stipulate the collective bargaining  rights of the union.  In Europe, the Fujitsu European Labor Relations Council Annual General Meeting has taken place every year  since 2000, with the overall financial conditions of the Fujitsu Group and other issues shared with the employee  representatives from Fujitsu Group companies.  Fujitsu has established a consultation service as a contact point for email and phone queries to the Human  Resources and Administration Units. This is part of a structure that is designed to make it easy for employees to  seek guidance on human resource and administrative programs.    In-house Social Media Network  The Fujitsu Group uses an in-house social media network to strengthen the ties between people all round the  world, enabling diverse and talented employees to engage in communication that goes beyond the  organization. As communities become more diverse, this network offers spontaneous forms of communication  for employees that go beyond mere interchanges within the organization, encouraging new business plans,  secondary jobs and workations, and allowing exchanges of information on careers in the life sphere, such as  child-raising and caring.  It is also used by employees to discuss opinions and aspirations circulating in the community, such as staff  management policies and the environment.

For example, as part of our efforts to boost the  availability of personal computers, we donated computers,  educational tools, and meals to schoolchildren in Phetchaburi  Province. As the issue of digital inclusion becomes increasingly  important, Fujitsu wants to help reduce gaps in learning  opportunities and thereby create a more inclusive digital society  on a global level.    Mindfulness Lab in the Americas  The Mindfulness Lab has been launched in Americas Region, in response to  requests from participants, and features mindfulness webinars hosted by  the Americas Responsible Business Wellbeing Lead. The 30-minute,  biweekly Mindfulness Lab sessions include exercises that support calmness,  focus, and connection. Guided by the Lead, who is a certified Mastermind  Mindfulness Facilitator, the sessions incorporate a mindfulness topic, a  relevant practice, and time for discussion.    Moving your Wellbeing Dial in Australia and New Zealand  Fujitsu invited Dr. Sarb Johal to present a session to employees in Australia  and New Zealand. Active in many disciplines, the psychologist is also a  broadcaster and best-selling author of books such as “Finding Calm:  Managing Fear and Anxiety in an Uncertain World”. During the session, Dr. Johal encouraged participants to  think about and acknowledge recent global and regional challenges and he explored tools and practical tips to  move our well-being initiatives in a more positive direction.

To achieve  our purposes, we have therefore set “protecting the physical and mental health of our employees and creating  an environment where all employees can work positively and healthily, both in mind and body” as a key  sustainability issue to be shared globally, which we are promoting in tandem with our health and safety  activities as the “Health Well-being” initiatives of a Global Responsible Business (GRB).  In Japan, we have announced the Fujitsu Group Health Statement and are promoting GRB Health Well-being  activities as health management initiatives. We believe that our efforts to maintain and boost the health of  employees and their families and to improve the work environment will lead to higher productivity, invigorate  individuals and organizations and enhance human resource retention, and that aiming to create a work  environment where each employee can work positively and healthily both in mind and body will help us to  fulfill our purposes. Moreover, the results obtained through Fujitsu's health management initiatives will be  broadly publicized to society, and through the provision of ICT we will contribute to resolving social issues.

At the Sustainability Management Committee that meets every six months, committee  members check the progress of activities and the achievement status of targets, deliberate on new activities  and report the results to the management council and the Board of Directors.  In Japan, health management is led by the Chief Health Officer (CHO). The CHO heads the Health Management  Office, which consists of the Employee Success Unit, the Health Promotion Unit and the Fujitsu Health  Insurance Society. The Health Management Office holds regular meetings twice a month to analyze health- related data and issues, set targets and indicators, draw up plans, carry out measures and manage, evaluate and  improve progress. The results are regularly reported to the CHO. The Health Management Office plays a  central role in the implementation of measures, working together with the Health and Safety Committees in  offices and Group companies, occupational health physicians and industrial health and safety staff to urge  organizations (division heads, managers, Work Environment Improvement Support Staff) and individuals  (employees and their families) to action.  Two meetings have been established to promote health management initiatives: the Central Health and Safety  Committee and the Health Management Cooperation Council. The Central Health and Safety Committee  reflects the opinions of employees by discussing issues and sharing information with the representatives of  labor unions and the representatives from offices and divisions. At the Health Management Cooperation  Council, the Health Management Office and corporate, research and business divisions share information in  both directions about Fujitsu's health management initiatives and about health management-related business  initiatives being carried out by research and business divisions. They encourage the adoption of health  management in business while promoting the application of ICT (such as in demonstration experiments).

To that end, our goal for 2022 is to have an average score of 71 globally for  ''work-life balance'' and ''work environment'' in the Engagement Survey, which we are working to achieve in all  regions and Group companies.  In Japan, under our aim of creating an environment where all employees can work positively and healthily, we  set five indicators about improving productivity, invigorating individuals and organizations, and enhancing  human resource retention to serve as final health-related evaluation indicators. To improve and reinforce each  indicator, we created a health management strategy map. We are tackling the areas representing the five  priority measures on the map, namely    1. Cancer & lifestyle disease countermeasures  2. Mental health countermeasures  3. Oral and dental health measures  4. Health literacy and health awareness improvement, lifestyle improvement, and  5.

This amount not only covers external expenditures such as costs  of medical examinations but also includes the cost of personnel for the Health Promotion Unit, which is the  organization that implements various health measures, equipment-related costs, and indirect costs.    Expenses of main measures   Cost of medical examinations  472 million yen   Cost of stress check  9 million yen   Cost of e-learning  7 million yen   Cost of company-wide seminar  1 million yen          Indicator verification examples  The relation between Work Life Shift working styles, stress and health risks  According to stress checks, the overall health risk was 99 in FY2021 and 96 in FY2022, showing a trend toward  improvement.  An analysis of teleworking rates, highly-stressed persons and health risks shows that the number of highly- stressed persons decreases as the rate of teleworking increases. However there is a U-shaped relationship  between overall health risks and teleworking rates. Workload control risks and workplace support risks both  increase for the group with low teleworking rates. Workload control risks decrease as the rate of teleworking  increases, but when the teleworking rate exceeds 90%, workplace support risk increases. (Graph 1)  An analysis of long overtime hours, highly-stressed persons and health risks shows that workload control risks  and overall health risks increase with longer overtime hours. (Graph 2)  The results of this analysis show that stress and health risks can be reduced by creating a hybrid work system  by combining the flexible use of time and locations based on work contents and purpose and lifestyles that  teleworking offers with the effective use of real-life communication at the office, and by coupling the hybrid  work system with a reduction in overtime hours through the proactive application of flexible work structures  such as flextime and discretionary systems. Thus we will further promote Work Life Shift as a new working style  that allows employees to display even higher productivity and continue to innovate.        These kinds of analysis results are released to all employees through the portal site and internal newsletters  along with health dynamics data (health examination data, leaves of absence, etc.) and stress check results.

Since its inception, we have held a total of five sessions, involving 1,750  employees, covering themes of thoughtfulness toward others, management of  emotional and mental well-being, perspective of DE&I leaders, workplace anxiety,  and business culture.    Well-being Week in the Netherlands, Europe  Health related activities are regularly held in Europe. In the Netherlands, we  encouraged employees to partake in well-being activities for each of the daily  themes taking place during Well-being Week. In the UK, health checks are provided  at the whole hub location, with over 300 employees attending. To remove mental  health related barriers at the workplace, we regularly share webcasts on a variety of  topics, including burnout syndrome, resilience promotion, and detecting anxiety.  Furthermore, we also held a virtual yoga session for employees in Europe.     External Initiatives in UK  At Fujitsu UK, we shared information on the support system available to employees and how to assess well- being in the publication of Managing Workplace Health and Wellbeing in a crisis (published January 2022), and  discussed their connections to Fujitsu’s business goals in the UK as part of the National Forum for Health and  Wellbeing at Work.    Colour Kitchen in Germany, Austria and Switzerland  In autumn 2022, Fujitsu conducted the Colour Kitchen recipe campaign together  with its health insurance program by Siemens, in which favorite healthy recipes  submitted by employees in Germany, Austria and Switzerland were featured in the  company’s digital recipe book. This campaign helped promote the fun in making  dishes among colleagues as well as helped enhance motivation to achieve health  in the workplace. The 21 healthiest recipes were chosen from the many entries submitted.     10,000 Steps Challenge in Germany, Austria and Switzerland  In the 10,000 Steps! – Every step counts campaign, a total of over 30 million steps were recorded using a  smartphone app from 47 teams in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. This is  equivalent to a 362-ton reduction in CO2 compared to traveling the same distance  by automobile. This three-week long campaign that started in July 2022 motivated  employees to walk more in their everyday life. Many employees have continued to  use the app to monitor their steps as they have developed a workout routine even  after the campaign ended.     Communication Plan for Well-being in Americas  In the Americas, a communication plan was established to encourage and  penetrate health education and activities for employees. We communicated with  all employees 26 times through the company newsletter. Those 26 themes  communicated included tips on maintaining health, boosting mental support, and  well-being.               Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 103 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  5-2-5-8  © Fujitsu 2023  Major Domestic Initiatives  Countermeasures for Lifestyle-Related Diseases  Fujitsu and its domestic Group companies provide  support for independent health management by  carrying out health checkup in accordance with  legally mandated health examination items, with  additional items by age group, as well as offering  checkup results via online systems and providing  information such as health risks and changes over  time. In addition, with regard to employees who have  abnormal findings after receiving checkups, we aim to  improve their lifestyle habits, and provide thorough  medical checkups and consultations, through health  guidance and medical examination recommendations  supplied by occupational health physicians and  occupational health staff. For employees who have  been diagnosed as needing treatment due to their test results, the Fujitsu Health Insurance Society monitors  their medical prescriptions for three months to prevent their post-diagnosis condition from worsening, and  recommends checkups for employees who have not undergone treatment, which leads to appropriate medical  care. In addition, family members of employees (spouses of those enrolled in the Fujitsu Health Insurance  Society, and family members 40 years of age and older) are able to undergo the same health checkups as  employees (including cancer screenings).     Project to Prevent Diseases from Becoming Severe    Cancer Countermeasures  Taking steps against cancer involves engaging in prevention through improvement of lifestyle habits, as well as  early detection through health checkups and treatment. We promote regular additional screenings for stomach  cancer, colorectal cancer, and prostate cancer when employees undergo legally prescribed health checkups,  based on age group. In collaboration with the Fujitsu Health Insurance Society, we conduct and support the  expenses for gynecological examinations (cervical cancer and breast cancer) for all female employees. In  addition, to screen for stomach cancer, the Fujitsu Health Insurance Society runs tests for Helicobacter pylori  for 35-year-olds and conducts in-depth examinations on those who test positive.  Additionally, we hold “Cancer Prevention and Support for Balancing Work and Treatment” e-learning seminars  for all group employees in order to equip them with accurate knowledge about cancer, and to lead to  prevention through improvement of lifestyle habits, as well as early detection and treatment through health  checkups. We also provide e-learning materials to employees’ families in cooperation with the Fujitsu Health  Insurance Society.    Mental Health Countermeasures  At Fujitsu and its domestic Group companies, through  health consultations, employment support and  recurrence prevention for those with mental health  issues, and mental health education provided by  occupational health staff at each office, we support  employees and workplaces, which leads to improved  mental health. Furthermore, we have full-time  psychiatrists and licensed psychologists on staff to  offer counseling during working hours, providing a  system for receiving professional support within the  company. Health consultations and counseling can  also be accessed online, creating a structure where  they are available from anywhere, including when  working from home. The Fujitsu Health Insurance  Society also provides health consultations and  counseling over the phone and online so that employees and their families can easily consult them.

The Support Staff work together with managers to solve work management challenges, detect  poor health quickly based on employee performance and daily communication with them and to respond at an  early stage by coordinating with the Health Promotion Unit and Human Resources Unit.  For stress checks, in addition to supporting employee self-care through checkups, we provide feedback to  management and senior staff members by integrating organizational analysis results with engagement surveys  and other internal studies, then synchronizing these efforts with Work Life Shift initiatives, which leads to better  working environments. In addition, for workplaces with high levels of health risk and workplaces with many  employees who have been evaluated as highly stressed, we offer stress management education and workshops  for creating healthy workplaces to provide support for reducing employee stress factors and energizing the  places where they work.      Work Life Shift    Oral and dental health countermeasures  Oral and dental health plays an important role in maintaining and improving health for the whole body while  also greatly affecting QOL (quality of life) across a lifetime. Therefore we have set it as an important health  issue and we hold activities such as dental examinations and preventive dentistry seminars to promote oral and  dental health.     Dental examinations   We provide tooth checks (caries and fractures), periodontal pocket measurement and brushing guidance  for employees aged 25, 30, 35 and 40 to prompt them to take an interest in oral and dental health from an  early age and encourage early treatment and prevention.   Preventive Dentistry Seminars  In cooperation with JOF (*11), we hold a preventive dentistry seminar entitled ''Preventive dentistry in the  Reiwa era from 2019 onwards,'' to share knowledge on issues such as the etiology of cavities (caries) and  periodontal disease, dental examination methods, self-care methods with the aim of KEEP28 (*12).    *11 JOF@KEEP28 Corporation (Japan Oral Physicians Forum)  *12 KEEP28 is a social preventive dentistry initiative promoted by JOF aimed at not losing a single tooth from the time it comes in until  the end of your life and living the rest of your life with your own teeth without losing any from your current age.    Health literacy and health awareness improvement  Through various kinds of health education such as health guidance, e-learning, training for managers and  company-wide seminars, through various events about exercise, diet and smoking, and by sharing information  through internal newsletters and portal sites, we aim to improve employees' health literacy and health  awareness and form healthy habits.    - Assessment of health literacy  Using the scale of Communicative and Critical Health Literacy (CCHL), employees are assessed for their  average score in each of the five categories on a five-point scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly  agree: ability to collect information (ability to gather information from various sources from newspapers, to  books, TV, and the Internet, etc.), ability to select information (ability to find information one is looking for  from a lot of information), ability to convey information (ability to understand and convey information to  others), ability to determine information (ability to determine the credibility of information), and ability to  make decisions (ability to plan or make decisions for health improvement based on the information).

In FY2022,  e-learning was conducted on the topic of physical activity and lower body health as seen from lower back  pain, where 34,359 employees in Japan participated. In the post-learning survey, 90% of participants who  responded said that the learning was helpful.   Regular employees: Receive education about self-care when joining the company or changing jobs  through e-learning.   Managers: Receive education about their subordinates' mental healthcare when appointed as managers  and once every three years as part of their people management education.   Company-wide seminars: Seminars are broadcast to all Group company employees in Japan about topics  such as exercise, nutrition, diet, smoking and women's health. In FY2022, an average of 1,200 employees  participated in live seminars, with 94% of participants who responded to the post-seminar survey said that  it was helpful.   Office seminars: Seminars are held on themes such as mental health and health promotion, based on the  issues faced by each office.  * Refer to FY2022 Performance: Health Education for more details    - Health events   A company-wide walking event, “Let's Walk Together”  To cultivate a habit of exercising in daily life and increase health awareness, Fujitsu and all Group  companies in Japan hold a company-wide walking event called ''Let's Walk Together'' twice a year in  spring and fall. Participants compete on an individual and team basis with the average number of steps  walked in a month using a smartphone app. There are individual and team incentives for the employees  with the highest average number of steps, teams that achieve 6,000 average steps in a day, teams that  achieve 8,000 steps daily and other metrics.  Furthermore, during Fujitsu Learning Festival 2022, a global walking event will be held to help the whole  organization to be aware of walking in everyday life. Each step will be connected to a donation that  contributes to the SDGs.   A quitting smoking promotion event, “Let’s Stop Smoking Together”  We organize an event where two to five non-smokers form a team with one smoker, who attempts to quit  smoking over three months with the support of the team. Along with encouraging people to stop smoking,  it provides opportunities for both smokers and non-smokers to think about smoking and health. Teams  that successfully get their smoking member to quit are awarded incentives.   A nutrition education event, “Let’s Learn About Food Together Day”  We have declared the 19th of every month to be Food Education Day. In addition to introducing healthy  recipes using seasonal ingredients and information about health effects via email newsletters, we prepare  special menu items using those ingredients at the employee cafeterias all over Japan, and work to improve  employee awareness of what they eat.   Online fitness program – 5 minutes a day challenge  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 106 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  5-2-5-11  © Fujitsu 2023  With working from home becoming mainstream under Work Life Shift, Fujitsu  and Fujitsu Health Insurance Society together launched a sports event via an  online service hosted by RIZAP and athletes of Fujitsu Sports to encourage  mental and physical reset, promote an active lifestyle and approach  employees without a workout routine, with the goal to promote health  maintenance among employees.  * Refer to FY2022 Performance: Health Events for more details    Work environment development  The Fujitsu Group prepared a ''Health Report Card'' that visualizes data about the status of employee health on  a division and company basis and the status of health improvement initiatives compared to the Group as a  whole. It provides this card to management as  feedback along with employee engagement surveys  and stress check group analysis results, and the  management works together with the workplace to  develop the working environment while sharing  employee health-related issues.   We also aim to improve the work-life balance and  productivity of every individual employee by  implementing a variety of measures to reduce long  working hours. By promoting Work Life Shift, we have  developed structures that support diverse working  styles, taking teleworking as a basis and actively  adopting flexible working arrangements such as  flextime and discretionary work systems.      Sample Health Report Card  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 107 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  5-2-5-12  © Fujitsu 2023  Smoking Prevention Measures  Starting from October 2020, Fujitsu and its domestic Group companies have completely banned smoking at all  offices to protect employees from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke, and in an attempt to reduce the  health risks of smokers.  Furthermore, to support efforts by smokers to quit smoking, we also hold seminars so that employees will  accurately understand the health effects of smoking, and provide support and subsidies for treatment to quit  smoking. In addition, the “Let’s Stop Smoking Together” Challenge, an event held once a year by all domestic  group companies where smokers and non-smokers form teams to tackle quitting smoking, has improved  awareness of quitting smoking and an attitude of fostering measures against smoking, group-wide and in all  workplaces.    Health Initiatives for Female Employees  For health issues specific to women, we provide education, share information and have established a dedicated  consultation window to raise women's health  awareness and generate concern and understanding  for health issues that women face. We also implement  or support the costs of screening for cancers specific  to women, all of which is aimed at driving the creation  of a workplace where women can work positively.     A women's health portal site has been set up on  the intranet to disseminate information on  different themes about women's health (such as  hormones, life planning, menopause, and cancer),  seminars held, archives of past seminars and a  women's health consultation window.   We broadcast seminars on women's health to all  Group employees online to coincide with Pink  Ribbon Day every October and Women's Health  Week in March. By targeting all employees and  not just female employees, we help all employees to take an interest in and have correct knowledge about  female-specific health issues. This encourages the development of a work environment easy for women to  work in and supports the active participation of female employees.   In coordination with our DE&I measures, we make time for women-specific health issues at seminars about  balancing childcare and work that are held for employees returning from childcare leave and supervisors  with employees raising children under them.   Gynecological examinations (cervical cancer and breast cancer screening) are conducted for all female  employees and employees can be examined at no personal cost. They can choose to undergo the  examination as a set together with their company's mandatory health examination, or visit a contracted  medical institution or visit their regular doctor for an examination.    Support for Balancing Work with Medical Treatment  The fundamental idea at Fujitsu and its domestic Group companies is that employees should undergo proper  treatment, then return to work after recovery. We have established various leave systems and income support  mechanisms so that employees can have peace of mind and devote themselves to medical treatment. We  provide support from medical staff while an employee is on leave, so that they can make a smooth return to  work. When they return, we conduct joint discussions with the occupational health physician (occupational  health staff), HR, the employee’s department head, and the employee themselves, and review their post-return  work duties and employment considerations.

Infectious Disease Countermeasures  Fujitsu and its domestic Group companies actively engage in countermeasures to keep employees safe from  various infectious diseases by establishing health consultation services and dispensing information, among  other initiatives. As preventative measures against infectious diseases, we give seasonal influenza vaccinations  at companies, in addition to giving vaccinations to employees stationed overseas which are recommended in  each place they will be staying (at company expense). With regard to the issue of rubella, which has been  growing in recent years, we are cooperating with local governments to conduct education and public  awareness campaigns at offices.    Response to COVID-19  The Fujitsu Group has established a Central Infectious Disease Countermeasure Unit headed by the president  to centrally manage all information while the General Affairs Unit, Human Resources Unit and Health  Management Unit work together to take measures against COVID-19.     Consultation  We have established a dedicated online hotline and email consultation service to respond to employees  and their family members who have health concerns. We provide instructions to put them at ease, and so  they can take appropriate action and seek medical care. In addition, the Fujitsu Clinic (Kawasaki City,  Kanagawa Prefecture) handles people who are worried about infection, in conjunction with health care  centers and regional specialist medical institutions.   Providing information and education  We have established a COVID-19 countermeasure site (Central Countermeasures Unit/Health Promotion  Unit). It shares response guidelines for COVID-19, knowledge and the latest information about coronavirus  infection, health considerations for teleworking (how to comfortably telework, exercise, diet, smoking,  mental health, work environment) and other such information necessary for the mental and physical health  of employees and their families.   Working styles  We are thoroughly implementing teleworking, which makes it possible to work flexibly without being  limited by a place, such as at home, satellite offices or on business trips to help prevent COVID-19  infections.

Chronic headache disorders, which include migraine,  tension, and other chronic headache types, have a  significant impact on daily life and work productivity. To  address this problem, Fujitsu has developed and  implemented training programs for employees globally  in the workplace to promote awareness and treatment of  headache disorders, as well as prevention programs for  employees suffering from such disorders. Fujitsu’s efforts  were evaluated by the International Headache Society as  a model case of corporate measures to support  employees living with headache disorders.    Background  In the workplace, chronic headache disorders tend to be  trivialized due to a common lack of understanding. As a  result, many employees that suffer from these disorders  continue to work while enduring painful headaches and  other severe symptoms, leading to a decline in  productivity and quality of life (QOL).  In June 2018, Fujitsu conducted an in-house survey in  cooperation with International Headache Society, the  World Health Organization (WHO), and the Japan  Headache Society among Fujitsu employees about the  impacts of chronic headache disorders on their work.  Of the 2,500 people surveyed, 85% had experienced  headache disorders. Of those who experienced  headache disorders, 84% had never been treated. In  addition, it was found that the economic loss to Fujitsu  due to headache disorder-related sick leave and lower  performance was approx. 900 USD per year per  chronic headache disorder-affected employee in  average (in case of migraine approx. 2,300 USD), or  approx. 197 million USD per year for all employees,  representing approximately 1% of the total annual  salary paid to all employees. It was also revealed that  health-related QOL scores (*14) of employees with  chronic headache disorders were lower than the national standard for Japan. This demonstrates that headache  disorders have a significant impact on daily life and work productivity. To address this issue, Fujitsu launched the  “FUJITSU Headache Project” as a headache disorder prevention program that is now globally available to all  employees.      Figure 1.

Utilizing e-Learning programs to help Fujitsu  Group employees in Japan acquire correct knowledge  about headache disorders, Fujitsu held video seminars  for headache patients, online headache consultations  with specialists, and headache exercises. Through  these initiatives to help employees with headache  disorders, Fujitsu attempts to improve QOL and boost  work productivity, and aims to create a workplace  where people suffering from headache disorders can  work with peace of mind.     1. Project period: July 2019 to February 2022  2. Target: approximately 70,000 Fujitsu Group employees in Japan  3. Content: e-Learning programs and on-demand video seminars, online headache consultations, etc.    Future developments   To expand the Fujitsu Headache Project program to regions overseas, we are offering e-learning  educational materials in English and holding headache seminars for all global employees.   Based on the results of the Fujitsu Headache Project, Fujitsu, the International Headache Society and the  Japanese Headache Society will analyze the project to check whether there was increased understanding  and knowledge about chronic headaches and to see how much improvement there was in the burden and  lowered productivity caused by headaches.   IHS-GPAC is making the headache management program developed through the Fujitsu Headache Project  available to the public.    *13 Global Patient Advocacy Coalition of the International Headache Society (IHS-GPAC):  The International Headache Society is a UK-based academic organization founded in 1981 for headache-related research, medical  care and education.

This demonstration illustrates a difference of 7.5 million yen in medical expenses  over the four-year period between early stage cancer and advanced cancer. In FY2021, a total of 22,000  Fujitsu employees underwent fecal occult blood tests for colon cancer screening, 4% underwent detailed  examinations, and 12 were found to have early-stage cancer.   The total cost of colon cancer screening and detailed examination was 43 million yen. If the 12 people  were to be diagnosed with advanced cancer through a medical examination, the total medical expenses  for four years would be about 90 million yen. The early screening has economic merit as it saved 47 million  yen in medical expenses. Aside from the cost aspect, the early detection and treatment of cancer through  cancer screening also minimizes productivity loss as a result of sick leave.   Joint development of a Migraine Improvement program with the Global Patient Advocacy Coalition of the  International Headache Society (IHS-GPAC)    * Refer to FY2022 Performance: Health Management Promotion and Social Contributions  for other public announcements.

This policy has been approved by the management  meeting and is being implemented in each region.      Fujitsu Group’s Health and Safety Policy    Ensuring the health and safety of Fujitsu's employees is one of the most important management topics, and  it is given the highest priority in all of Fujitsu's business activities.        Promotion Framework and Reviews  The Fujitsu Group has established a system to promote health and safety in each region, and we are moving  forward to ensure compliance and preventive measures for occupational health and safety in accordance with  the laws and policies of each country, such as those stipulated by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare,  ILO, etc., through a comprehensive, region-led approach.  We have set up the Central Health and Safety Committee in Japan, which is comprised of the executives in  charge of the Human Resources Unit and Health Promotion Unit, and representatives and others from the  Labor Union to function as an overseer for the Health and Safety Committees at each business site. It meets  once per year to share information and report to management and those in charge at each location about the  confirmed status of disasters that have occurred at business sites, and about preventative measures, while also  formulating Group-wide health and safety related policies.  In addition, the health and safety management organizations at individual business sites, comprised of staff  from the Human Resources and Corporate Affairs departments and representative of each business site, hold  monthly Health and Safety Committee meetings. These committees establish policies suited to the unique  characteristics of each site, set priorities, and work to create healthier, safer workplaces in accordance with  policies related to the occupational health and safety. These health and safety management organizations also  survey the worksites to check and improve on any potentially dangerous areas or causes of health hazards, and  conduct risk assessments. Emergency response protocol is posted on the intranet of each business site for  emergency preparedness. In the event that an employee is injured on the job, the Human Resources  Department has a workflow in place to promptly collect information from employees on when and how an  accident occurred to respond promptly.  We have set medium- and long-term goals that we aim to achieve in the Europe, Global Delivery and the  Americas regions to strengthen governance, establish health and safety management systems, and develop  human resources and health and safety teams for fostering a culture that does not tolerate occupational  accidents. Specifically, we are providing employees of each region with tools for occupational accidents  reporting, workplace assessments, and occupational health and safety support service from a dedicated team.  Furthermore, we regularly host an occupational safety and health leadership forum aimed at monitoring and  reviewing the safety and health efforts at the level of each region and country. At the forum, major information  relevant to the business is shared for ongoing review and improvement of associated safety and healthy  activities.

Specifically, we provide information on health and safety, offer training opportunities to  promote awareness towards health and safety and take steps for the prevention of occupational accidents, as  well as encourage employees to develop exercise habits and take preventive actions against accidents.  Furthermore, we also strive to maintain and improve the quality of our activities, including acquisition of  international certifications. The details of our initiatives aimed at improving employee safety and health are  reported and shared with the Sustainability Management Committee, which meets semi-annually.    Occupational Health and Safety Training  We provide health and safety training, as well as health education that raises health awareness, for the entire  Group and for the unique environments at each office. In particular, as information that raises the awareness of  employees, industrial physicians and counselors send messages as necessary in regard to topics such as  COVID-19 (effects of vaccination, etc.), and physical and mental health maintenance.    Infectious Disease Countermeasures  In response to COVID-19, we recommend working from home as a way to prevent the spread of the virus and  for employees around the world to work safely and with peace of mind. In addition, we have disseminated  guidelines for working from home, enabling employees to carry out operations smoothly, regardless of  environment. We also review our conventional way of business operations and take measures to encourage  appropriate behavior and practices among employees as members of society.  As office environments, we are implementing measures such as periodic checks on the percentage of  employees in the office, having seat layouts which take social distancing into account, making alcohol-based  disinfectant available, and managing records of where people sit in non-fixed seating, in order to provide  workplace environments where employees can work safely and with peace of mind.  We implement a variety of measures, including consultation service for infectious disease via the intranet for  employees in each region and country, information provision for the prevention of infectious disease, and  outlines of pandemic measures taken in each country.    Initiatives for Obtaining International Occupational Health and Safety  Certifications  The international standard of ISO 45001 certification for occupational health and safety management (OH&S)  has been obtained by some domestic Group companies and by Group companies in the UK, Ireland, France,  Spain, Australia, Germany, and Portugal. Since January 2023, we have been awaited the same certification for  Group companies in India. In addition, we have introduced an ISO 45001-certified safety management system  in the European, Global Delivery Group, Americas and Oceania regions.

In the Europe and Global Delivery Group regions, we conduct annual GSA compliance training to ensure that  employees acquire basic health and safety skills. The training is designed for employees to learn through  games and competition, including a competition between trainees of each country.

In  August 2017, we acquired SBT certification (2℃-aligned) for our reduction standard by 2030. As the movement  toward carbon neutrality accelerated, we reconsidered the role that the Fujitsu Group must fulfill, and in April  2021 we raised our GHG emissions reduction target for 2030 from a 33% reduction compared to FY 2013 to a  71.4% reduction. This reduction target has been certified as 1.5℃-aligned by SBTi.  In order to accelerate decarbonization in the global community together with our supply chain, we have moved  up the target deadline for 100% reduction by 20 years from the previous FY 2050 to FY 2030.  Furthermore, we have decided to aim for Net-Zero emissions in the entire value chain, including the supply  chain (Scope 3), by FY 2040.  To ensure this target, we will follow the Fujitsu Group Environmental Action Plan (Stage XI) that we created as  our activities through FY 2050.  (Our Net-Zero target for FY 2040 from the base year of FY 2020 received Net-Zero Certification from the SBT  initiative in June 2023.).      Initiatives for Achieving Goals   Since 2018, the Fujitsu Group has been a member of the international initiative RE100, which aims to popularize  and expand renewable energy.  Previously, we focused on our sites in Europe and the United States. In April 2021, however, in anticipation of  full-scale introduction in Japan, we switched all electricity used in the Kawasaki Plant, the largest in the Fujitsu  Group to renewable energy as Fujitsu’s flagship model.  This initiative affects approximately 5% of the Group’s electricity consumption in Japan.  Furthermore, in April 2022, Fujitsu Australia signed the largest renewable energy power purchase agreement  (PPA) in the Group, accounting for approximately 38% of its annual power consumption.

For example, since its inauguration in 1976, Fujitsu Numazu Plant has been  actively greening its facilities. It constantly maintains the natural environment in its premises, managing lawn, a  biotope, a tea garden and other gardens in its premises, as well as green areas such as woodland that remains  in its natural state, including ecosystems. In addition, a large green area is opened to local residents as a place  for relaxation, where the Plant carries out many community exchanges holding seasonal events such as “tea  picking festival” and “waling to experience nature.” Numazu Plant also is actively working to preserve  biodiversity by pasturing goats for weeding, eliminating designated invasive alien species, raising “southern  Japanese rice fish” (Oryzias latipes), an ancient Japanese species, in its biotope, and through other activities. In  recognition of those continuous greening efforts, in April 2023, Numazu Plant received Prime Minister’s Award  for the 2023 Greening Promotion Movement, an award given by the Prime Minister to an individual or an  organization that made outstanding achievements in the promotion of greening activities or the spread of  greening awareness.

Now, to simplify the environmental value creation process (collection, verification, and reporting of  data such as CO2 emissions) for the J-Credit(*2) issuance, they launched the “J-Credit Easy Generation”(*3) in  June 2023.  As part of this initiative, the two companies applied for, and were selected as, collaborators engaged in a  project for the “Outsourcing of Research and Development towards Digital Technology Utilization in FY 2023 J- Credit System” of the Japan’s Ministry of Environment. They will work on this project from June 2023 to March  2024.  The two companies plan to start providing the “J-Credit Easy Generation” as a module of the environmental  value distribution platform in FY 2024.    Overview of Joint Project  Since FY 2022, Fujitsu and IHI have been carrying out a joint project to create an environmental value  distribution platform, which converts CO2 emissions reductions calculated using data collected at IHI’s IoT  platform “ILIPS” (IHI group Lifecycle Partner System)*4 into tokens*5 that can be distributed on the  environment value exchange market using Fujitsu’s “ConnectionChain”*6 a technology that securely  interconnects different blockchains.  By adding “J-Credit Easy Generation” to the environmental value distribution platform, companies and  organizations that are making environmental contributions, such as reducing CO2 emissions (environmental  value creators) will be able to easily convert their environmental value, such as CO2 reductions, into J-Credits.  At the same time, by promoting the application of digital technology to J-Credit trading, Fujitsu aims to build a  sustainable value chain model that enables buyers to smoothly trade the environmental value created by  environmental value creators in the form of J-Credits.  Using “J-Credit Easy Generation” as a starting point, the two companies will contribute to the realization of  carbon neutrality by expanding their businesses to tackle the digital verification of the diverse environmental  values, including product carbon footprint.

To this end, they conducted joint trials for one year from September 2021 to verify the  practical application of environmental data(*9), including wind conditions, obtained and converted through  power transmission facilities of Chugoku Electric Power T&D.  In order to boost the use of renewable energy, power transmitters and distributors are aiming to develop next- generation power networks by strengthening power grid(*10), developing grid control technologies, and in  other ways. Chugoku Electric Power T&D also actively take on this challenge.  Moreover, Chugoku Electric Power T&D utilizes drones for maintenance work, such as patrolling and inspecting  its facilities, and locating any malfunctions. As drones flight is greatly affected by wind, however, further  utilization of them requires real-time and accurate monitoring of environmental data (wind conditions) in the  vicinity of power lines installed over a wide area.  Utilizing Fujitsu’s proprietary data conversion technology, these joint trials converted optical ground wire  (OPGW)(*11) vibration data from the OPGW of the power transmission lines through optical fiber sensing  technology(*12) into estimated environmental data in the vicinity of the transmission, and then compared and  verified that data with the actually measured data at the site. Consequently, it was confirmed that they were  generally in agreement with each other.

(*1) ISO14001 : Environmental Management Systems (EMS) standard determined by the International Organization for  Standardization (ISO). Certification is granted to environmentally conscious organizations that develop systems for ongoing  reductions in their environmental footprint.      Fujitsu Group’s Environmental Management Systems (EMS)  Fujitsu Group has constructed Environmental Management Systems (EMS) based on the ISO 14001  international standard and is promoting environmental improvement activities across the Group. After acquiring  ISO 14001 certification for consolidated subsidiaries in Japan at the end of FY 2004, we expanded this effort to  include overseas subsidiaries and acquired global integrated certification at the end of FY 2005. Subsequently,  the overseas subsidiaries switched to individual certification.    Environmental Management Framework   In April 2020, Fujitsu Group set up the Sustainability Management Committee, which leads the charge for  management which takes sustainability initiatives into account. The Sustainability Management Committee has  established major sustainability issues which are common globally (Global Responsible Business: GRB) and is  working to address them, and the environment is  one of those to be addressed. In order to promote  environmental activities, we consider medium- and  long-term issues, formulate policies, share business  risks and opportunities due to climate change,  consider ways to respond, and report regularly to  the Sustainability Management Committee in order  to improve EMS and strengthen governance. Based  on that, final approvals on environmental  management at the Fujitsu Group are made at  meetings of the Management Council.   In the promotion of environmental activities, we  have organized environmental organizations in  charge of issue-specifics, etc., composed of relevant  parties that go beyond the framework of business  groups and business units. Through the promotion  structure shown in the figure below, we are moving  swiftly to popularize initiatives for addressing  environmental issues throughout the Group.     Constructing and Operating Environmental Management Systems   The Fujitsu Group has constructed EMS based on the ISO 14001 international standard and is promoting  environmental improvement activities across the group. By constructing EMS worldwide, the Fujitsu Group  further strengthened its Group governance. This also allows the Group to promote even more efficient and  highly effective environmental activities, including understanding the state of activities, legal compliance, and  emergency response.  As of March 2023, Fujitsu and 29 domestic Group Fujitsu companies had acquired ISO 14001 Group Integrated  Certification.In the Group as a whole, 62 companies, including 30 companies with integrated certification, have  acquired ISO 14001 certification.

For example, the committee determines the directions to be  taken for reduction of energy consumption and CO2 emissions, countermeasure for environmental risk, and  other environmental medium-to-long term visions. The Sustainability Management Committee also conducts  environmental management reviews and is  exercising approval authority for the Fujitsu Group  Environmental Action Plan.   Organizations in charge of issue-specific are sub- organizations set up under the Sustainability  Management Committee, with the goal of providing  dedicated responses to address specific tasks  professionally. The tasks of the organizations are  discussing targets and confirm the progress and  promote to achieve for the Environmental Action  Plan. After receiving progress reports from the  organizations, the Environmental Management  Controller approves the status of activities and  suggestions of future focuses, etc., and instructs all  organizations to implement the necessary initiatives.    Management Based on the Line/Site Matrix Structure   The Fujitsu Group carries out its environmental  management within a matrix structure combining (1)  “line activities” directly tied to the business  operations of various Business Groups and  companies (including development of eco-friendly  products and the expansion of environmental  contribution solutions) and (2) “site activities” to  tackle common themes affecting each factory or  business location (such as energy conservation and  waste reduction). In this way we carry our  environmental management according to the same  framework as our management, while also reducing  the environmental footprint generated by our  business activities and the sale of our products and  services.

Implementing Environmental Audits   Internal Audit Implementation and Results   The Fujitsu Group conducts internal audits, a requirement of ISO 14001. To ensure the objectivity and  independence of internal audits, the Internal Control and Audit Office takes the lead, allocating internal  auditors who belong to Fujitsu or Fujitsu Group companies and carries them out. For the internal audit in FY  2022, we continued to consider the promotion of Work-from-Home through work style reforms, and conducted  on-site audits at manufacturing sites, data centers, and other sites with a high environmental impact.  In FY 2022, we carried out internal audits of 72 business sites in Japan, including the plants and offices of Fujitsu  and its Group companies. When conducting audits, we closely examined the results of internal audits and  external audits from FY 2021. The four points emphasized were (1) the status of implementation of the  environmental management system, (2) the feasibility of achieving Environmental Action Plan Stage X, (3) the  status of initiatives that regard the environment as a business opportunity, and (4) the status of the response to  environmental risks associated with business conversion. There was one finding of a minor defect (non- conformity) and 11 observations (conformity). Of the observation, two were considered to be an effect of the  resumption of on-site audits.

The Risk Management & Compliance Committee, which reports directly to the Board  of Directors, has set up regional Risk Management & Compliance Committees, in addition to deploying Risk  Management & Compliance Officers to each Fujitsu division and Group company in Japan and overseas, to build  a structure where these organizations cooperate with each other to promote risk management and compliance  throughout the Fujitsu Group, both in terms of preventing potential risks and responding to risks that have  emerged. The Committee identifies, analyzes, and assesses key risks associated with the business activities of  each Fujitsu division and Group company in Japan and overseas (focusing on 33 risks considered to be  important to the Group), and formulates and reviews the countermeasures for these risks after confirming the  status of countermeasures for avoiding, mitigating, transferring, or retaining them. The Committee makes  regular reports to the Board of Directors about key risks that have been identified, analyzed and assessed, using  methods such as the creation of visualized rankings and maps which take the degree of impact and likelihood  of occurrence into account. In addition, we have put response processes into place in the event that risks  become tangible, despite the implementation of various measures. Each division and Group company will  immediately report to the Risk Management & Compliance Committee about any key risks that become  tangible, such as natural disasters, accidents, product accidents or failures, system or service problems,  compliance violations such as fraud, information security incidents, or environmental problems.  We also leverage the group’s Environmental Management System (EMS), which is based on ISO14001, for  minimizing risks to the environment through continuous improvements.     Risk Management   Environmental Management System      Efforts to Minimize Risks to the Environment  Dealing with Risks Related to Climate Change  There is a possibility of significant impacts on our business continuity from increases in the frequency and  effects of natural disasters as a result of recent climate changes. For that reason, we have formulated a  business continuity plan and are devoting effort to continually revising and improving the plan.  In addition to risks such as implementation of stricter regulations for greenhouse gas emissions and a carbon  tax, there is demand from customers and society for contribution to carbon neutral. This creates a risk of  increasing the energy cost incurred by the Fujitsu Group, as well as the cost required to comply with regulations  related to measures for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, if climate change countermeasures  are insufficient, there is a risk of harm to our corporate reputation or a disadvantage at bidding.   In order to minimize these risks, we are conducting short-term, medium-term and long-term risk  analysis/response within our company-wide risk management structure. As the trend toward carbon neutrality  in the global community as a measure against climate change, we have obtained net-zero target certification  from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). We will further raise the 1.5°C level we acquired in fiscal 2021  and aim for net-zero by FY 2040.  In accordance with the recommendations issued in 2017 by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial  Disclosures (TCFD), the Fujitsu Group analyzes and discloses information related to risks accompanying climate  change that may have an impact on business and financial strategies.

The Fujitsu Group  conducts assessments of and monitors potential water risks for direct operations sites and supply chains.  Specifically, while using tools and databases provided by NGOs and national and local governments, we  identify water stress conditions and natural disaster risks in regions where our business sites are located in  accordance with RCP 4.5 (intermediate stabilization scenario) from among the emissions scenarios defined by  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). We then comprehensively assess the water risk at each  site by analyzing how important water use is in the business activities of each operations base, and we confirm  the level of compliance in a variety of activities such as the reduction of water intake, measures to reduce  pollution in wastewater, business continuity management (BCM) systems, and others. For the supply chain, we  also assess our suppliers' flood preparedness and other water risks based on the supply chain BCM surveys,  field surveys conducted according to the Responsible Business Alliance's (RBA) code of conduct and the CDP  Supply Chain Program. As a result, we have confirmed that there are no significant risks that could substantially  affect our business activities.

As physical risk is different based on the location, adaption is tailored to that specific location and risk, for  example.  Fujitsu Australia and New Zealand has identified the main physical climate risks to our business in the region,  which include short term weather events e.g. extreme heat, flooding, storm events, as well as long-term climatic  impacts e.g. drought.  Key measures undertaken in Australia and New Zealand to adapt to climate risks have included:     Extreme heat events   Processes to ensure built-in redundancy of critical equipment and reliable operation of uninterruptable  power sources in the event of grid-scale outages.   Ensuring equipment is designed to tolerate extreme temperatures.   Installing temporary cooling equipment (e.g. misting) to reduce ambient temperatures.   Bushfire   Updating site-based procedures to assess business critical activities and evaluate which activities can  be performed remotely in the short term.   Turning off external air intakes to offices and data centers to limit smoke ingress.   Drought   Deployment and maintenance of rainwater storage tanks at some sites.   Use of recycled water where possible.   Installing real-time water loggers at all data centers to monitor consumption trends and help inform  water usage efficiency projects.   Other   Climate risk (e.g. extreme heat modelling) incorporated into assessment of siting of new data centers    Within Europe the climate risk is different to Oceania and a number of measures to adapt to climate change risk  have been undertaken at a cost of over £1million in one London location showing the seriousness that we  consider Climate impact and the commitment that we take protecting our continued service.

We  identify and assign rankings to business sites which will be highly impacted. If a business site falls under a level  4 impact ranking, we implement various measures.    [Assessment 1  Planned scale (Rainfall on a scale that occurs about once every 10-100 years)]   Assessment subjects: 169 sites for Fujitsu, 280 sites for Group companies All owned properties and major  leased properties (such as sales offices and data centers) in the Fujitsu Group   Assessment method: We assess whether or not the site falls within the ''estimated flood inundation area  (planned scale)'' for nearby rivers as established by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and  Tourism or the prefectural government, as well as the extent of the impact within and outside the site and  the impact of flooding on buildings.  We rank sites that were assessed as being impacted by flooding on a scale of 1 (minor impact) to 4 (major  impact).

We recover and recycle chemicals used in production processes, instead of  discharging them into wastewater. We are also working to properly manage and reduce discharge of harmful  substances and other regulated substances (COD, BOD, etc.) by ensuring appropriate chemical use, preventing  chemical leaks and penetration, and properly managing the operations of water treatment and purification  facilities, among other measures.    Preventing Air Pollution  We have set voluntary control values that are more stringent than legally mandated emissions standards in  order to prevent air pollution and limit acid rain. Regular measurement and monitoring are conducted based on  these controls. Efforts are also made to appropriately process dust and soot, sulfur oxide, nitrogen oxide, and  other harmful substances, and reduce emissions through measures including combustion management at  facilities that produce soot and smoke, use of fuels with low sulfur content, and managing the operations of  exhaust gas processing equipment. Furthermore, we have installed activated carbon adsorption treatment  equipment and are reducing our atmospheric emissions of organic solvent vapors containing substances like  VOCs. Moreover, with the enactment in April 2015 of the Act on Rational Use and Proper Management of  Fluorocarbons, we have set in-house stipulations and striven for proper management of specified products  (commercial refrigerators and air conditioners containing fluorocarbon refrigerants) while working to identify  the volume of our fluorocarbon leakage.  In addition, emission of dioxins has been prevented by suspending use of all in-house incineration facilities as of  January 2000.

On the other hand, with regard to  fluorocarbons for refrigerants used in air conditioning facilities (freezers, etc.), we are switching to non- fluorocarbons when equipment is renewed, and are working to appropriately manage and dispose of Class I  specified products in accordance with the Fluorocarbons Emission Control Act.  In addition, the annual confirmation of the amount of leakage in the calculation of fluorocarbons indicates that  it is less than 1,000 t-CO2 (not subject to reporting to the minister in charge) for FY 2022.

We review these in  accordance with changes in the law and social circumstances and respond based on these rules. We  systematically examine soil and groundwater, based on the rules, and if pollution is confirmed, we carry out  cleanup and countermeasures at each plant according to the situation, while working together with  government authorities to disclose information.  As of FY 2021, there are four business sites where soil and groundwater pollution from prior business activities  have been confirmed. At those business sites, we have installed observation wells to observe effects outside  the site due to groundwater pollution, while also working on purification measures through water-pumping  aeration, etc.        Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 140 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC    5-3-1-19  © Fujitsu 2023  Business Sites Where Soil or Groundwater Contamination Has Been Found  Site Name  Location  Cleanup and  Measure Execution  Status  Maximum Value Found at Observation  Well (mg/L)  Regulated  Level  (mg/L)  Substance  Measured  Value  Kawasaki  Plant  Kawasaki  City,  Kanagawa  Prefecture  We are continuing  to clean up VOCs by  pumping and  aeration.  1, 2-dichloroethylene  2.4  0.04  Chloroethylene  6.8  0.002  Oyama  Plant  Oyama  City,  Tochigi  Prefecture  We are continuing  to clean up VOCs by  pumping and  aeration.

Fujitsu Group Environmental Action Plan (Stage IX): Reducing Chemical Substances Emissions    With regard to chemical substances included in products, we have determined banned substances according  to regulations in Japan and worldwide and are working to thoroughly control them, not only inside the Group  but also with business partners who deliver materials and products to us.     Green Procurement    Appropriately Processing Waste   In accordance with the Act on Waste Management and Public Cleansing, we appropriately store and manage  waste generated from our business sites, select waste disposal companies that can properly dispose of waste,  and outsource disposal. Also, we regularly carry out on-site audits in order to confirm that subcontractors are  appropriately handling the waste processing tasks we entrust to them. As part of our efforts to reduce waste,  we are promoting the reuse of certain plastic trays in cooperation with a vendor that is working to reuse plastic  trays and convert them into recyclable materials.    Environmental Liabilities  In properly assessing the Fujitsu Group’s expected future environmental liabilities, and communicating our  integrity and corporate stance of not deferring our liabilities, we have recorded liabilities of 2.25 billion yen in  soil pollution cleanup costs, high-level polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) waste disposal costs, and asbestos  processing costs during facilities demolition, which is the amount we calculate, as of the end of FY 2021, to be  necessary for the Fujitsu Group to conduct these tasks domestically in the next fiscal year and beyond.

This  necessitates the disclosure of relevant information disclosure by companies, and toward this end, the Task  Force on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) is considering an information disclosure framework.  If the Fujitsu Group fails to appropriately respond to information disclosure in accordance with the TNFD, its  corporate reputation may decline and its ability to procure funds may be affected. Going forward, we will  provide disclosures in line with the TNFD framework.    Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 142 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023  FUJITSU-PUBLIC  5-3-1-21  © Fujitsu 2023  We are implementing green procurement alongside our business partners, to provide customers with products  and services that have light environmental footprints.      Procurement Activities Based on Green Procurement Direction  The Fujitsu Group summarized its requirements for business partners regarding the purchase of green parts,  materials, and products, in the ''Fujitsu Group Green Procurement Direction.'' This standard is posted on a  multilingual basis (in three languages) in order to promote penetration to our business partners. We make an  effort to communicate by various means, such as briefing sessions or individual meetings if necessary. Through  such activities, the Group implements green procurement activities in conjunction with its partners in Japan and  overseas and it promotes procurement from business partners that fulfill the green procurement requirements  (see below).  Using the Fujitsu Group Environmental Survey Sheet, we conduct annual monitoring of our business partners'  statuses with regard to environmental management systems, CO2 emission reduction, biodiversity preservation,  and water resource preservation activities, and ask them to take appropriate measures. When making requests,  we provide them with various kinds of information—such as guidance on activities to reduce CO2 emissions,  explanatory documents related to water risk, and the water risk information tool AQUEDUCT—which have been  useful for our business partners.

Specifically, we ask them to clearly express the intentions of their initiatives and request that they make efforts  to achieve the objectives they set. We also ask them to collaborate with external organizations, where possible,  and encourage their own suppliers to make similar efforts, in order to expand the initiatives outside their  respective businesses. Our annual Supply Chain Business Continuity Survey gives us a clear picture of how  business partners are responding to a variety of climate-change risks, including tsunamis, floods, and torrential  rains.   Moreover, as a new initiative, we are asking our main suppliers to establish a CO2 reduction target based on the  international standard of Science Based Targets (SBT) as we strive to further reduce global warming.      Water Resource Conservation Initiatives   As populations grow rapidly and water sources become progressively more contaminated, the increased need  for water around the world, as well as water resource scarcity, has become an international challenge. Water  resource conservation initiatives are necessary, even in business activities. The Fujitsu Group asks its business  partners to investigate and understand the water risks associated with their own companies, and engage in  water resource conservation initiatives, such as preventing water pollution and reducing water use.      Acquiring and Managing Information on Chemical Substances  Contained in Products  Countries around the world are establishing legal regulations as to the chemical substances contained in  products, for instance the RoHS directive (*3) and the REACH regulation (*4). The scope of such regulations is  expanding on an almost day-to-day basis, covering more and more substances, products, and applications.  The Fujitsu Group, using chemSHERPA (*5) as its standard format, investigates and acquires information on the  chemical substances contained in our products. We share our findings with Group companies via our internal  system, and allow relevant parties to access the information whenever necessary. We have established a  system that allows for quick adaptation to revisions of laws/regulations and the enactment of new legal  systems.

Doing so enables the Group to comply even more thoroughly with laws and regulations related to the chemical  substances contained in our products.  The Group also carries out CMS audits in order to confirm appropriate establishment and operation of such  CMS. More specifically, Fujitsu's auditors implement on-site evaluation of the management status of the  chemical substances contained in our business partners’ products. If there are any inadequacies, auditors make  requests for corrections and provide support for their enactment. Even after the establishment of CMS, we  maintain awareness of its operation status through periodic audits.    (*6) JAMP: Joint Article Management Promotion-Consortium.

The Group has elected to fast-track its previous commitment to achieve “zero CO2 emissions  within the Group by FY2050”, instead bringing forward its Vision by 20 years to FY2030. The Group has set the  additional target of reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions (*1) throughout the value chain by 2040.    *1 Net-zero greenhouse gas emissions: Reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 90% in the target year in comparison to the base  year, and re-absorbing remaining emissions (of 10% or less) from the atmosphere through direct air capture (DAC) technologies or  by planting trees.      The Importance of Responding to Climate Change  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report “Global Warming of 1.5°C“ articulated  the need to limit warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. With  social roles expanding and additional demands placed on companies to tackle climate change, in October  2021 the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi) (*2) launched the world’s first Net-Zero Standard for companies  to set net-zero strategies.  In order to resolve issues related to climate change, the Fujitsu Group decided to revise the Group’s previous  commitment to ''zero CO2 emissions by 2050'', pursuing instead a more ambitious strategy than simply net-zero.  This requires the Group to look beyond social trends and become the very embodiment of a leading SX  company, one that drives the achievement of carbon neutrality.  The new vision comprises three pillars, namely, Value chain: Achieve net-zero emissions, Mitigation: Contribute  to a carbon-neutral society, and Adaptation: Contribute to climate change adaptation measures. The Fujitsu  Group will be quick to leverage advanced DX technologies to tackle its own net-zero strategies, and will make  the resulting expertise available as Fujitsu Group solutions for customers and society. In so doing, the Group  aims to leverage its own business activities to contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation    *2 Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi): An initiative jointly established by the United Nations Global Compact, the World Resources  Institute (WRI), and other organizations in 2015. It encourages companies to set GHG emission reduction targets consistent with  science-based evidence to the level required by the Paris Agreement, validating targets that comply with criteria including indirect  emissions not only within the company but also in the supply chain.

In April 2021, the Group obtained certification for its 1.5 °C ambition level (*3) which increased the  target from 33% reduction in emissions to 71.4% throughout its business sites by FY2030, against a baseline of  FY2013.  To accelerate the move toward carbon neutrality, the Group set a new target to achieve net-zero emissions  from the Group’s business activities by FY2030, and from the entire value chain by FY2040, thus earning Net- Zero Target certification from SBTi in June 2023.    *3 1.5°C: According to a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a 1.5 °C increase in average temperature  increases the risks of extreme weather, sea level rise, adverse health effects, food shortages, and water scarcity. The United Nations  Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP) states that the increase in the global average  temperature shall be limited to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels in order to avoid the worst effects of climate  change.      Contributing to a Carbon-neutral Society  The Fujitsu Group contributes to the decarbonization of society by creating ecosystems with customers in a  variety of industries and business types. The key to mitigating climate change is to use AI and other advanced  digital technologies to optimize energy efficiency. By building such technologies into a framework that  transcends business, industry, and regional boundaries, the Group will achieve optimal utilization of energy  throughout all systems in society.    Contributing to Climate Change Adaptation Measures  The key to adapting to climate change is advanced forecasting technology that uses simulations, AI and big  data, enabled through sensing technologies and high-performance computing (HPC). Fujitsu will utilize these  to create solutions that lead to resilient societal infrastructure as well as stable supply of agricultural crops and  minimal food loss, thereby contributing to minimizing the harm that climate change causes to our customers  and to society.

Net-Zero Target Certification Gained from Science Based Targets  (SBTi)  In August 2017, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction targets set by  the Fujitsu Group for emissions from its business facilities and value chain was  approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as meeting the  science-based level of ambition criteria. The SBTi was established in 2015  jointly by a number of organizations, including the World Resources Institute  (WRI) and UN Global Compact. It encourages companies to set GHG  emission reduction targets consistent with science-based evidence to the  level required by the Paris Agreement, with the aim of limiting the global  average temperature increase caused by climate change to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels.  In April 2021, we updated our target to 71.4% and received acknowledgment of our 1.5 °C-aligned strategy  from SBTi.  We have now decided to further advance our existing target and aim for net-zero by FY2040. In June 2023, we  received Net-Zero Target certification from the SBTi.    Net-Zero Target   To reduce GHG emissions at our business sites (Scope 1, 2) and from the entire value chain (Scope 3) by at  least 90% by FY2040 against a baseline of FY2020. (*1)    *1 Less than 10% of residual emissions are removed and stored by technologies that directly capture CO2 from the atmosphere or  through absorption by afforestation and other means.      Joining RE100 as Japan’s First Gold Member  In July 2018, the Fujitsu Group became Japan's first  Gold Member of RE100, an initiative which aims to  significantly expand the adoption of renewable  energy on a global scale. At the time, the Fujitsu  Group pledged to use renewables to provide at least  40% of the electricity consumed across all global sites  by 2030, and 100% by 2050.  RE100 is an initiative led by international NGO The Climate Group in partnership with CDP and consists of  companies committed to source 100% of their electricity requirements from renewable sources.  With the intention of accelerating its efforts toward carbon neutrality, the Group has since brought forward its  previous target date for 100% renewable electricity, shaving off 20 years to achieve 100% by 2030 instead of  2050. To achieve this target, the Group will continue to roll out activities based on the corporate action plan.  The Fujitsu Group will expand its procurement of renewably sourced electricity for data centers outside Japan  and other locations in Japan and around the globe by considering the most appropriate means for each region.  The Group will concurrently continue its work on R&D and technology trials for energy management and  storage, and contribute to the spread of renewable energy in society as a whole.

This  committee examines medium- to long-term issues, formulates policy, shares the business risks and  opportunities of climate change and decides how to address those risks and opportunities, and manages the  company’s progress. It also reports on the results of its activities to the Board of Directors at meetings of the  Executive Management Council. In October 2020, the committee made a key decision by revising the Fujitsu  Group GHG reduction target (SBT) from 2.0°C to 1.5°C. In April 2021, the new target was validated as 1.5°C- aligned to the SBTi. In October 2021, the results of scenario analyses using two external scenarios, one for  1.5°C and the other for 4°C, were reported to the Sustainability Management Committee. The findings  prompted lively discussion among the committee members on topics such as the need to discuss management  strategies, the selection of key solutions, and the measurement of impacts once solutions are provided.  Within the company-wide risk management regime and with oversight by the Board of Directors, the Risk  Management & Compliance Committee, chaired by the CEO, conducts risk analysis and implements responses  for the entire Group, including on issues relating to climate change. This committee is also the ultimate  decision-making body for risk management and reports regularly to the Board of Directors regarding major  risks that have been identified, analyzed, and assessed. The Fujitsu Group has also developed environmental  management systems (EMS) based on the ISO 14001 standard, and the results of EMS activities are reported to  the Board of Directors at meetings of the Executive Management Council.  To further strengthen governance relating to climate change, in April 2022 we added ESG-related third-party  evaluations (DJSI(*2)) and CDP climate change program(*3) as assessment indices for the bonuses paid to  Executive Directors. As of FY2022, these indices will apply to their bonuses.

The analyses studied businesses likely to be impacted by climate change in the following  areas: Sustainable Manufacturing (sectors studied: petrochemicals, automotive, foods, electronic device-related  businesses), Trusted Society (sectors studied: public sector, transportation, energy-related businesses), and  Hybrid IT (sector studied: datacenter-related businesses).    Scenario selection    1.5°C, 4°C scenarios  *Established with reference to information published by the IPCC, the IEA, governance  agencies such as the Ministry of the Environment and the Japan Meteorological Agency, and  various private research organizations.  For the main reference scenarios, RCP 8.5 and RCP 2.6 are used as physical scenarios, and  IEA NZE 2050 (Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario) and IEA STEPS (Stated Policies  Scenario) are used as transition scenarios.  Target businesses  Opportunity-focused analysis: Addressing climate-related risk in client industries    Sustainable Manufacturing (sectors studied: petrochemicals, automotive, foods, electronic  device-related businesses)    Trusted Society (sectors studied: public sector, transportation, energy-related businesses)  Analysis of both risks and opportunities: Addressing climate-related risk in Fujitsu businesses  and client industries    Hybrid IT (sector studied: datacenter-related businesses)  Period covered    2050    Analysis steps & details  The analysis was conducted in 4 steps: assessment of risk severity, definition of scenarios, evaluation of impacts  on business, and discussion of countermeasures.  We began by organizing the risks and opportunities for the target businesses based on data such as the TCFD  recommendations and external reports. We also conducted workshops to look at the qualitative aspects of  business impacts stemming from each risk and opportunity item from the perspectives of Fujitsu and industry  generally. We rated the severity of each risk or opportunity as “High”, “Medium” or “Low”. We then considered  the future changes in each of the items classified as having a “High” severity and defined our scenarios using  data from agencies such as the IPCC, IEA, and the Ministry of the Environment, together with the evidence  provided in various reports. Specifically, we held an executive input session to consider global outlooks for  2050 given temperature rises of 1.5°C and 4°C, and then went on to consider the global outlook for each of the  target industries, using tools such as Five Forces analysis. (See below for the 1.5°C global outlook.)    Global outlook of a 1.5°C “carbon-neutral world in 2050”      Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 154 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  5-3-2-9  © Fujitsu 2023  To look at the impacts on business, we then tentatively calculated the qualitative gap between the scenarios  and our existing strategies and plans with respect to risks and opportunities. For Hybrid IT (sector studied:  datacenter-related businesses), we discussed how the impacts of climate change on business would affect our  Profit and Loss Statement, specifically looking at which financial indicators would be impacted and in what  ways. We then summarized those impacts by developing calculation logic for each impact. Both internal and  external data and information were used to confirm the positive (opportunities) and negative (risks) impacts on  operating profit in 2050. For example, the calculations for the 1.5°C scenario showed rising costs due to  changes in power prices, but also revealed that there will be increased demand for carbon-neutral datacenters  and for datacenters generally due to increased communications traffic as the uptake of smart devices  accelerates. Overall, the calculations showed that the negative financial impacts of risks will be outweighed by  the positive financial benefits arising from opportunities, ultimately leading to a net positive financial impact on  operating profits.  Our analysis of Sustainable Manufacturing (sectors studied: petrochemicals, automotive, foods, electronic  device-related businesses) and Trusted Society (sectors studied: public sector, transportation, energy-related  businesses) focused on the business opportunities arising from climate change, assuming the potential to  establish new climate change-related markets and concluding that the net impact on sales in 2050 would be  positive.  Finally, we held a workshop in which we organized the trends in each industry that had been identified when  defining the scenarios and the direction of measures to deal with the business impacts requiring emphasis. In  specific terms, during the group work we reviewed the current initiatives and gathered views on the directions  that future initiatives should take, taking into account the expectations on Fujitsu in the medium- to long-term.    Analysis results  Because we were able to confirm that the study and development directions for our business unit offerings are  aligned with the opportunities shown in the scenario analyses, and that countermeasures for the identified risks  are also being prepared, our assessment was that Fujitsu’s businesses are strategically resilient from a medium-  to long-term perspective.  Our current themes and areas are “Carbon Neutrality” and  “Resilient Supply Chains” in the Sustainable  Manufacturing area, and “Sustainable Energy & Environment” and “Sustainable Transportation” in the Trusted  Society area, and we are progressing with the development of our offerings.

Risk Management  As part of our company-wide risk management system, we have established the Risk Management and  Compliance Committee to identify, assess and manage risks across the entire Fujitsu Group, including those  related to climate change. To conduct company-wide risk assessments on a regular basis, the committee  prepares tools, distributes them to each Risk Management & Compliance Officer and gathers responses. The  departments in charge of each risk across the company utilize these tools to conduct assessments on items  such as the impact and likelihood of occurrence related to risk threats and the status of countermeasures, and  they also provide responses regarding those risk threats. Climate change-related risk assessments are  conducted by all relevant departments, using information collected from across the company, based on the  expertise of each department in areas such as policy, reputation, natural disasters, the supply chain, and  products and services.

The results of this analysis are reported to the  Board of Directors.  The Sustainable Management Committee shares the business risks, opportunities, and countermeasures  resulting from climate change, and manages their progress. The Fujitsu Group has also established  environmental management systems based on the ISO 14001 standard. Under these systems, we monitor  regulatory compliance and other risks.      Metrics and Targets  In 2017, the Fujitsu Group obtained 2°C-aligned certification from the SBTi for its GHG emissions reduction  targets, and in 2021 we were granted 1.5°C-aligned certification for our revised targets. To accelerate our efforts  towards carbon-neutrality, we set new targets to achieve net-zero emissions from our business activities by  FY2030 and net-zero emissions through our entire value chain by FY2040 and were granted net-zero certification  by the SBTi. In line with the SBT updates, we have also revised our RE100 renewable energy target, bringing our  target of 100% renewables by 2050 forward by 20 years and aiming to achieve 100% renewable energy by  FY2030.  Against our target of 100% Scope 1 and 2 GHG reductions in our own emissions by FY2030, in the current year  we achieved a reduction for FY2022 of 34% on FY2020 levels. Against our target of a 90% reduction (on FY2020  levels) in GHG emissions throughout the value chain (scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions) by FY2040, we also achieved a  4% reduction in FY2022.  We boosted our use of renewable energy up to 30.0% in FY2022 towards our target of 100% renewable energy  use by FY2030.

At the G7 Summit, held in June 2021, we  agreed on a G7 2030 Nature Compact, which includes a commitment to “halt and reverse biodiversity loss by  2030”. During part 2 of the 15th Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD- COP15) - held in December 2022 - the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, which includes  international targets for 2030, was adopted. The framework establishes “23 Global Targets for 2030” aimed at  the 2030 Mission “To take urgent action to halt and reverse biodiversity loss to put nature on a path to recovery  for the benefit of people and planet” (excerpt).  Committed to delivering nature-positive outcomes, in 2022 the Fujitsu Group formulated its vision for 2050, its  2030 Mid-term Target, and its 2025 Short-term Target (Environmental Action Plan Stage XI) in line with  international targets (Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework). Achieving the vision will contribute to  satisfying the Fujitsu Group’s stated purpose to “Make the world more sustainable by building trust in society  through innovation.”    Vision (2050)  Create a world in harmony with nature, where ''nature and biodiversity,'' which are  fundamental to a sustainable society, are fully restored through digital  technology  Mid-term Target (2030)  Reduce negative impacts on biodiversity by at least 25% (Base year : FY2020) in  the area of company's corporate activities, including supply chain, and promote  activities to increase positive impacts on it.  Short-term Target (2025)  Reduce negative impacts on biodiversity by at least 12.5% (Base year : FY2020)  in the area of company's corporate activities, including supply chain, and promote  activities to increase positive impacts on it.      Response to the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures  (TNFD)  The Fujitsu Group will implement disclosures in accordance with the TNFD Framework going forward. In  addition to comprehensive evaluations of corporate activities as a whole using ecological footprint as an  indicator, we will conduct an evaluation of regional characteristics with reference to the TNFD Guidelines, etc.  In terms of the evaluation pertaining to regional characteristics, the Group will first evaluate the use of land and  water resources at its own sites, and then expand the scope of evaluation to include other corporate activities  and value chains. The results of these evaluations will be disclosed as appropriate. The Group will comply with  all disclosures in accordance with the TNFD framework by FY2025.

These  activities are ranked as activities that will increase the positive impact on biodiversity in the Group's short- and  mid-term targets.    1. Blakiston’s Fish Owl Call Recognition Project  The Fujitsu Group has provided the Wild Bird Society of Japan with call recognition software, developed for  use in habitat surveys of the endangered Blakiston’s fish owl. Implementing measures based on habitat  survey results is important for the conservation of the species. Surveys are conducted by analyzing sound  data recordings, but the main problem for the Wild Bird Society was that playing and replaying the  recorded sounds to identify the Blakiston’s fish owl was enormously time-consuming. By providing the call  recognition software, we helped streamline the surveys to enable the automatic extraction of the owl’s  cries, thus greatly reducing the time required for analysis.     Blakiston’s Fish Owl Call Recognition Project    2. Supporting the Harapan Rainforest (Forest of Hope)  We continually provide support to a project launched by BirdLife International Tokyo for reforestation  activities in the Harapan Rainforest (Forest of Hope) on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Dealing with  forest fires and illegal logging is an urgent issue in the Harapan Rainforest. This activity contributes to forest  conservation by implementing ICT to greatly improve the efficiency of forest patrol operations.

Coastal cleanup activities on Tsushima, An Island Seriously Contaminated by Marine Plastics  To deepen employees’ awareness of the global environmental issue of marine plastic pollution, and link this  to action to deal with the problem, Fujitsu Limited held a hands-on eco-tour of Tsushima for Fujitsu Group  employees in collaboration with the Japan Environmental Action Network (JEAN). The project involved a  beach cleanup, and an ideathon to come up with solutions to the island’s marine plastics problem.     Tsushima, an island seriously contaminated by marine plastics    Activity Example 4: Promoting Initiatives in Collaboration with External  Organizations (Keidanren, WIPO, JBIB)  The Fujitsu Group collaborates with various external organizations to promote initiatives for conserving  biodiversity. For example, we support The Declaration of Biodiversity by Keidanren and participate in the  Initiative based on the Declaration of Biodiversity by Keidanren. A further example is the promotional video for  the Business for GBF Project launched by MOE and Keidanren, featuring our case study Blakiston’s Fish Owl Call  Recognition Project. Fujitsu also participates as a partner in WIPO GREEN, a matchmaking platform operated  by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) for transferring environmental technologies and  services. This led to the conclusion of IP licensing agreements with academic institutions for the use of  technologies for conserving natural assets and biodiversity. In addition, Fujitsu participates in the Japan Business  Initiative for Biodiversity (JBIB), hosting activities together with enterprises for the purpose of research and  practice in biodiversity conservation.

Structural reforms undertaken since  FY 2015 have channeled most management resources into the core sector of Technology Solutions. In FY 2019,  Fujitsu repositioned itself as a Digital Transformation (DX) enterprise that aims to make full use of digital  technologies in the creation of innovative services and business processes.  The nature of the Fujitsu Group’s environmental impact has changed as a result of this modified business  model. As an example, most energy consumption in the past was linked to the manufacture of PCs and our  semiconductor and electronic component operations, but that requirement is declining significantly.  Conversely, the expansion of cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) is driving increased power  consumption in data centers, and this growing trend is expected to continue. We are therefore focusing at  present on energy conservation, efficiency enhancements and the use of renewable energy in our data centers.  In this way, the Fujitsu Group is implementing environmental activities that respond to the demands of society  while also supporting the corporate growth strategy.    Operating as a Responsible Global Corporate Citizen  Recent years have seen a further ramping up of demand for initiatives aimed at building sustainable  communities on a global scale, including the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by the  United Nations and the coming into effect of the COP 21 Paris Agreement. The Fujitsu Group employed a  materiality analysis in a Groupwide review designed to enhance the effectiveness of activities that aim to  contribute to sustainable development. This analysis identified six priority issues including the environment;  human rights, diversity and inclusion; wellbeing; and supply chain. The result is a unified framework under the  banner of Global Responsible Business (GRB), which will oversee activities that strengthen initiatives in non- financial areas while striving for ‘sustainability management’ worthy of a responsible global corporate citizen.      History of the Environmental Action Plan  Environmental Awareness Contributes to Sustainability for Our Customers  and Society  The Fujitsu Group has formulated an Environmental Action Plan since 1993 and continues to broaden the scope  of its environmental activities. Between stages I and V (FY 1993-2009) the objective was to significantly reduce  the environmental impact of the Fujitsu Group itself. Far-reaching measures were implemented throughout our  factories and offices to cut CO2 emissions and chemical pollutants, to reduce waste, and so on. In stage VI (FY  2010-2012), we expanded the focus of our activities to three important initiatives. In addition to strengthening  measures to lessen our own impact on the environment, we supported similar efforts by customers and society  as a whole and also took on the challenge of conserving biodiversity. Between stages VII and IX (FY 2013- 2020), we clearly demonstrated our commitment to contributing to the resolution of environmental issues  faced by customers and society through the use of ICT. In order to reduce our own environmental impact, we  expanded the scope of our activities to cover the entire supply chain, including suppliers. In stage X (FY 2021- 2022), we worked to promote and expand the use of renewable energy for our customers and society by  utilizing leading-edge ICT technologies unique to the Fujitsu Group, such as the introduction of renewable  energy at our business sites through CPPA and other means, and blockchain technology.

Fujitsu Group Environmental Action Plan (Stage XI)  Social responsibility as a leading company in Sustainability Transformation  (SX)  As a leading company in SX, Fujitsu Group is committed to reducing the environmental impact of its group  companies, including those in the supply chain, and to expanding and enhancing the value it provides to  customers and society through technology. We will work with our customers and partners to realize a  sustainable future.    Outline of the Fujitsu Group Environmental Action Plan (Stage XI)  In order to resolve environmental and social issues, we have set eight targets in three global risks areas  highlighted by the World Economic Forum: '' Climate Change,'' '' Resource Circulation,'' and '' Living in Harmony  with Nature ''. These are mapped against the two values of '' Customers and Society '' and '' Fujitsu and Supply  Chain''.  Fujitsu group is taking firm steps to realize its environmental vision, such as contributing to digital technology  for customers and society and increasing the ratio of its own use of renewable energy.  (Reference: Global Risks Report 2023)    Target period   3 years from Fiscal year 2023 to Fiscal year 2025    Customers and Society  Fujitsu aims to transform its core business with a portfolio of offerings focused on ESG Contribution and SX by  2030. In particular, to solve environmental issues in the areas of climate change and carbon neutrality, resource  recycling through circular economies, and biodiversity, we will connect stakeholders from across society and  industries and contribute to the SX of customers and people around the world. In FY 2023, we will develop  environmental contribution metrics to measure our impact on the environment, allowing us to provide services  with clear contributions and value. From FY 2024, we will measure and disclose the quantitative amount of our  contribution. Furthermore, as an SX leader and to realize a sustainable society in which no one is left behind, we  will develop solutions, services and initiatives that contribute to SX, deliver objective environmental metrics and  earn the trust and recognition of global customers and society.     Fujitsu and Supply Chain  Climate Change  In order to achieve Net Zero (*1) emissions of greenhouse gases from our business activities and from the  entire value chain, we set reduction targets for FY2025.  This will be achieved through the strategic introduction of renewable energy and the development of energy  conservation through the use of advanced ICT. At the same time, we will also promote the understanding and  reduction of the environmental impact of suppliers, as well as further energy saving of our products.    *1 Net Zero Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 90% or more from the base year in the target year and  remove residual emissions of 10% or less by directly recovering CO2 from the atmosphere (DAC) or by absorbing CO2 through planting  trees.    Resource Circulation  We aim to develop these products and services in FY 2025 in order to design products that conserve resources  and improve the resource recycling rate, and to build a circular economy business model that can overcome  resource constraints. We will also continue to reduce water use and raise awareness of water resource  conservation throughout the supply chain.

Correspondingly, moves aimed at achieving a carbon neutral society have been  accelerating on a global scale. Subsequently, the COP26 Glasgow Accords strengthened the 1.5°C target  adopted under the Paris Agreement and shifted the standard for global climate change measures to the 1.5°C  target.  Given this impetus, efforts towards achieving a carbon-neutral society are accelerating on a global scale.  The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) was established in December 2015 by the  Financial Stability Board, which includes participants representing central banks, financial regulatory authorities  and finance ministries from major countries. The TCFD requests companies to use multiple climate scenarios to  evaluate the climate-related risks and opportunities to their business and to assess and disclose the financial  impact. Various international initiatives have also been launched, such as the Science Based Targets initiative  (SBTi), which calls for corporate emissions reduction goals designed to meet the 1.5℃ target, and RE100,  which calls for companies to source 100% of the electricity they use from renewable energy. Furthermore, CDP  (*1), which runs the global disclosure system for investment that takes into account Environmental, Social and  Governance (ESG) factors, requests that companies reduce GHG emissions by at least 2.1% year-on-year  through voluntary efforts.    (*1) CDP: An international not-for-profit organization providing the only global system for companies and cities to measure,  disclose, manage, and share vital environmental information. CDP works with major institutional investors around the world to  encourage companies to disclose their impact on the environment and natural resources and to adopt measures that mitigate  the impact.      Fujitsu Group Position  GHG Emissions Reductions are a Critical Issue for the Fujitsu Group  The Fujitsu Group, as an entity with global operations, is fully aware that climate change is a serious worldwide  issue that spans national and regional boundaries. For example, disasters triggered by climate change can  disrupt procurement, logistics and energy supply networks, which in turn interrupts the process of supplying  materials and energy to business sites. Regulations governing GHG emissions have an impact on the  development and production of products and services, and any delays in responding to requirements can lead  to lost business opportunities.  Since launching the Fujitsu Group Environmental Action Plan, we have treated the reduction of GHG emissions  as a critical issue and worked to achieve the defined targets.  Most of the GHG emissions generated by the Fujitsu Group derive from purchased electricity, not from the  combustion of oil or gas. Advances in 5G technology will lead to the expansion of cloud computing, IoT and  mobile communications, thereby spurring increased power consumption in data centers, and this growing  trend is expected to continue. We are therefore focusing on reducing power consumption by conducting  energy conservation audits and regular power usage checks in our data centers, as well as in our factories and  production lines in Japan and elsewhere.          Environmental Action Plan  Climate Change  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 168 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  5-3-4-7  © Fujitsu 2023  Approach under the Fujitsu Group Environmental Action Plan   (Stage XI)  Strengthen Efforts to Achieve Carbon Neutrality  In May 2017, the Fujitsu Group formulated the FUJITSU Climate and Energy Vision, its medium- to long-term  environmental vision. In August of the same year, the company obtained SBT certification for 2°C-aligned GHG  emissions reduction targets. The SBTi aims to significantly reduce greenhouse gases over the medium to long  term by encouraging companies to set voluntary GHG emissions reduction targets based on scientific  knowledge compiled by organizations such as the IPCC (*2). Given the accelerating global trend toward carbon  neutrality, the Fujitsu Group reviewed its position and revised its target to reduce GHG emissions from business  sites in FY2030 from 33% to 71.4% below FY2013 levels. On April 15, 2021, this revised figure was successfully  validated as a 1.5°C-aligned target by SBTi. To further accelerate our carbon neutrality as a global company,  including our supply chains, we committed to expanding our use of renewable energy and achieving net zero  GHG emissions in our business activities by FY2030 and throughout our value chain (scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions)  by FY2040.  In June 2023, our target of net-zero by FY2040 obtained “Net-Zero Target certification” under the SBTi standard.  Working backwards from our future GHG emissions reduction targets, we have formulated our Fujitsu Group  Environmental Action Plan (Stage XI) as the implementation plans for our environmental targets between  FY2023 and FY2025. To achieve carbon neutrality, we are aiming for at least 50% of the energy used by our  businesses to be from renewable sources by FY2025, with a target of 100% by FY2030. At the same time, we  are working towards achieving net-zero GHG emissions across the entire value chain through measures such as  identifying the environmental impacts of our suppliers and promoting emissions reductions, and by further  reducing energy consumption by Fujitsu products.  From April 1, 2021, the largest facility in the Fujitsu Group, the Kawasaki Factory, switched over to 100%  renewable energy for power consumed. As such, it serves as a flagship model for the Fujitsu Group as we focus  on the future adoption of renewable energy in Japan. This initiative accounts for approximately 5% of the  electricity used by the Fujitsu Group in Japan. In April 2022, Fujitsu Australia signed the Fujitsu Group’s largest  ever Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for renewable energy, which will ensure that around 40% of Fujitsu  Australia's annual power consumption comes from renewable sources.  In addition, Fujitsu intends to continue boosting purchases of green energy and renewable energy certificates,  after considering relevant regional characteristics and the economic feasibility, and to implement more on-site  renewable energy capacity. Use of the Fujitsu Group’s leading-edge technological expertise in areas such as  blockchain technology will also contribute to the spread and expansion of renewable energy.

We have, therefore,  formulated our medium- to long-term environmental vision, the Fujitsu Climate and Energy Vision, and aim to  eliminate all CO2 emissions from our business activities by 2050.  Among GHGs, our business sites (plants and offices, as well as datacenters) primarily emit CO2 when energy  (electricity, fuel oil, gas) is used, and perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), sulfur hexafluoride  (SF6) during the manufacturing processes and PFCs and HFCs from fluorocarbon leakage. We will set reduction  targets in addition to complying with the relevant laws, and we are striving to reduce and control the volume of  use and emission of these gases.    Reducing CO2 Emitted During Energy Consumption  About 99% of the Fujitsu Group’s total GHG emissions arise from CO2 emissions due to energy consumption.  Therefore, we continuously promote the following energy-saving measures to reduce CO2 emissions.   Appropriate operation of equipment, improvement in management, and energy-saving measures focused  on motive-power facilities (introduction of free cooling, inverters and energy saving equipment, fuel  conversion, etc.)   Increasing efficiency by reviewing the manufacturing process (innovations in production, development of  green production technology)   Maintaining appropriate room temperature for office air conditioning, saving electricity used in lighting and  office automation equipment, and switching to LED lighting   Measuring energy consumption for visualization and promoting use of the data so collected    Reducing Emission of GHGs Other Than CO2  As for GHGs other than CO2, the Fujitsu Group mainly uses perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)  and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) at the manufacturing divisions. We are taking continuous steps to switch to gases  with lower global warming potential (GWP) and install equipment to remove harmful gases in our new and  existing production lines. We also carry out inspections and maintenance to comply with relevant laws  regarding PFCs and HFCs emissions resulting from fluorocarbon leaks from air conditioning equipment.

Moreover, we also improved facility operations (7,532 tons-CO2) by  reviewing air conditioner operating conditions, such as switching to higher efficiency equipment and  controlling the number of units, and suspending operation of pumps and air conditioning devices. Through our  own efforts, we carried out measures to reduce our emissions by roughly 13 ktons-CO2 (2.6% in comparison to  last fiscal year).  As a result of these initiatives, we reduced our GHG emissions according to market standards in keeping with  SBT, which is an objective in the Environmental Action Plan (Stage X), by 10.5%pt compared to the baseline  year (47.5% reduction in comparison to our emissions in FY 2013).

Data centers account for approximately 40% of the CO2 emissions (FY 2022) for each business in the Fujitsu  Group. Since data center CO2 emissions are expected to continue increasing along with the expansion of  digitalization, the Fujitsu Group has a social responsibility to promote environmentally friendly data centers. At  the same time, in terms of enhancing our business infrastructure, it has also become an important topic that we  should work on from a long-term perspective.

Promoting Activities to Achieve Our Goals  We are moving forward with activities to improve PUE at data centers in Japan and around the world, based on  the Fujitsu Group Environmental Action Plan. In 2022, as with 2021, we continued to expand operation-side  measures, including updating air conditioning equipment and striking the right balance by adjusting heat  amounts and cooling capacity for IT equipment. We made steady progress up to 2021 and reached our targets,  but in summer 2022 outside temperatures were warmer than FY 2021 globally (including some regions in  Europe rising by 4-degrees Celsius) and as a result, we were unable to meet our targets. However, we have  made a more than 1% improvement from the base year and continuous improvement activities are still  underway. In addition to energy conservation activities, we expanded our use of renewable energy with the  goal of carbon neutrality. This included switching our FJcloud service for domestic data centers to 100%  renewable energy, while Fujitsu Australia concluded the largest power purchase agreement (PPA) among the  entire Group.

To achieve this target, each business unit goals  to improve the energy efficiency of products that were expected to be developed in FY 2021 and FY 2022,  then worked to meet them. Applications of energy-saving technologies include new, high-efficiency  microprocessors and power supplies, energy-saving displays, optimized energy-saving controls, and the  strengthening of power management features. In addition to these, we are actively pushing for the aggregation  of LSIs, reductions in the numbers of components, and the implementation of eco-friendly devices.    Attained a 25% Reduction in CO2 Emissions in Comparison to FY 2013  In FY 2022, as a result of applying and expanding energy-saving technologies in our servers, storage, PCs, and  network devices, we were able to attain a 25% reduction in CO2 emissions in comparison to FY 2013.     Working Toward Our Targets  In order to achieve the Fujitsu Group’s medium-term environmental goal, each unit will work to further develop  products with improved energy efficiency. We will also implement advanced energy-saving technologies and  expand their application to our products, as part of our cross-Group policy to improve energy efficiency.  Looking toward the future, we aim to push the development of advanced eco-friendly devices, which will  contribute to revolutionary improvements in energy efficiency, and aim for the products to be applied at an  early stage.

As a result, all of our primary suppliers have undertaken efforts to reduce their CO2 emissions.  Starting in FY 2016, we have also been expanding these efforts further upstream in the supply chain by  requesting that our suppliers include their own suppliers (secondary suppliers from the perspective of the  Fujitsu Group) in these activities.  We have participated in the CDP Supply Chain program since FY 2018, in parallel with the above-mentioned  activities. Based on our international environmental research activities, we are taking a more in-depth look at  the activities of our primary suppliers to reduce CO2 emissions and conserve water resources, and considering  the issues and our policies.  Moreover, as a new initiative, we are asking our main suppliers to establish a CO2 reduction target based on the  international standard of Science Based Targets (SBT). Starting in FY 2022, we have also expanded the target  suppliers for CO2 emissions reduction to include those in the services industry in addition to the existing  category of parts manufacturing as we strive to further reduce global warming.  The Group hosts seminars on setting reduction targets based on SBT. In FY 2022, about 90% of target suppliers  attended the seminar.  In addition, we also host webinars on how to set targets and share FAQ. We support our suppliers’ CO2  reduction efforts through the provision of a simple tool for suppliers to visualize CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2)  of their own company and determine the appropriateness of their SBT.  We expect that having the supply chain as a whole work toward reducing emissions can produce even greater  reduction effects (synergies), while also expanding the network of these activities through the supply chain to  cover an even wider area spreading beyond national boundaries. Through efforts such as these, the Fujitsu  Group hopes to help create a carbon-free society for the future and a sustainable water environment.

We also conducted our own environmental survey  to ascertain the status of activities by these suppliers. We then provided suppliers who responded to the survey  with feedback in the form of a report that analyzed survey responses as a reference for their future activities,  and we also requested that they further promote these activities and expand them to include their own  suppliers.  As of the end of FY 2022, 24.2% (150 suppliers) responded that they had requested their own suppliers to  engage in emissions reduction activities. Over 61,000 secondary suppliers have been asked to engage in  emissions reduction activities, and this should substantially impact awareness.

The actions that organizations are urged to take in order to meet  this goal include the efficient use of natural resources, the appropriate management of chemical substances  and waste products throughout the entire product life cycle, and significant reductions in the volume of  pollutants emitted into the air, water, and soil. In addition, in March 2022, the European Commission announced  the first package of measures in its Sustainable Products Initiative (SPI), which is pivotal to the new Circular  Economy Action Plan formulated in March 2020. Following this, in November 2022 the second package of  measures was released with revised rules on packaging and packaging waste as well as a plastic circulation  policy framework with directives for bio-based, biodegradable, and compostable plastics. In March 2023,  further proposals were adopted on green claims and product sustainability. Regarding the series of sustainable  product standardization packages for the EU market in these announcements, companies need to closely  monitor future trends.    The Problem of Plastic Waste  According to a new report by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the  volume of plastic waste generated globally is forecast to triple by 2060 from its 2019 level of 353 million tons.  While the resumed fifth session of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA-5.2) held in February 2022  acknowledged the usefulness of plastics, it also noted that the problem of plastic pollution is global in scale  and includes the contamination of our oceans. It was decided that an intergovernmental negotiating  committee would be established in the second half of 2022 with the task of formulating a legally binding  global agreement to be finalized by the end of 2024. In view of these developments, companies need to  implement plastic resource circulation throughout the life cycles of their products.      The Fujitsu Group’s Position  Aiming for Resource Circulation  The Fujitsu Group has a long-standing commitment to the “three R’s” (reduce, reuse, recycle) relating to plastics  and other resources. We are conducting ongoing discussions around resource circulation for our products,  including reuse, recycling and the use of recycled materials, particularly in view of the acceleration of global  action and the abovementioned announcement of Europe’s new Circular Economy Action Plan in March 2020.  We are continuing to promote the use of recycled plastics in our IT products, switching from plastic to  cardboard packaging materials, and reducing the number of components used in our products while making  them smaller, thinner, and lighter. Another focus for Fujitsu is the recycling of resources from used IT products  and from waste generated at business sites. One of the targets we have been working towards in our  Environmental Action Plan is the reuse of resources in used IT products. Having reached a resource reuse rate  of over 90% for IT products used in business, we are now continuing our efforts by focusing on our  management targets. In light of the urgent need to address the problem of plastic waste, as outlined above, we  are promoting initiatives that target packaging materials and other plastic waste. Changes in our business  model are also resulting in reduced volumes of waste as we bolster our efforts to further limit waste and  recycle resources in order to make a stronger contribution to a society oriented toward resource circulation.

This ranges from limiting the use  of plastic products through to having local and municipal governments recycle plastics for use in other  products, and developing regimes that will promote voluntary plastics collection and recycling by businesses.  In line with this trend, Japan promulgated the “Plastic Resource Circulation Act” in June 2021. This Act targets  the plastics used in a wide range of products and promotes measures to recycle plastic resources in each stage  of a product’s life, from design right through to the treatment of plastic waste (3R + Renewable).  Fujitsu is designated as a “high-volume waste emitter” under the legislation, and as such, has set targets for  recycling and limiting the production of plastic waste and is promoting activities in line with those targets.

For example,  the EC has proposed the Circular Electronics Initiative, as well as maintenance for the eco design directive, and  is promoting a circular economy through the entire life cycle of products. This is a growing trend all over the  world. We believe that from the perspective of recycling resources, it is important for us to make efficient use  of the resources in the ICT products that we provide to customers. We have engaged in design that draws on  the principles of reduce, reuse, and recycle, and have developed our products with technology that is effective  in reducing the amount of resources we use. We are also making efforts to improve resource efficiency and  reduce our environmental burden by designing products to be lighter and smaller, using recycled plastics,  reducing the number of parts, enhancing ease of disassembly, and improving recyclability. Our goal is to offer  such products so that they provide even the customer with benefits, whether it be by making these products  smaller, more lightweight, or designing them so they take up less space.

Improved by 11.2%    Improving the Resource Efficiency of New Products  In FY 2012, the Fujitsu Group created its own definition of resource efficiency, as the Group had previously not  had a system that could comprehensively and quantitatively evaluate improvements in resource efficiency, and  due to the fact that there were as of yet no public indices that could measure resource efficiency.  In FY 2022, we continued to use our indicators to evaluate products newly developed by Fujitsu, and worked to  reduce product part quantities and reduce product size through smaller, thinner, and lighter parts and higher- density mountings.    We Improved Resource Efficiency by 11.2%  By reducing the size and weight of our servers, PCs, network devices, and imaging devices, in FY 2022 we were  able to improve resource efficiency by 11.2% with respect to efficiency in FY 2019.    Looking Ahead  In FY 2023 and beyond, Fujitsu will continue current initiatives, while expanding development of new  lightweight, rigid materials and the use of recycled materials. We will also widely publicize the eco-friendliness  of our products in order to expand sales.

Introduction of Other Initiatives (Case Studies)      Product Recycling  Our Approach  The Fujitsu Group's recycling activities are based on the concept of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR),  which holds producers responsible for product design and manufacturing as well as disposal and recycling, and  the concept of Individual Producer Responsibility (IPR), which holds a company responsible for its own  products. Fujitsu is certified for area-wide disposal of industrial waste based on the Act to Promote Effective  Utilization of Resources in Japan. In accordance with these concepts, Fujitsu Recycling Centers around Japan are  entrusted to properly dispose of industrial waste, and one of Fujitsu’s voluntary management indicators is ''to  reuse at least 90% of the resources in its ICT products for businesses.''

Such a water  shortage is a risk for companies as well, since it may very well affect the survival of their businesses. As such, it  is important for us to recycle and reduce the amount of water we use.  Since the Fujitsu Group uses particularly large amounts of water in the manufacture of semiconductors and  printed circuit boards, we believe it is necessary to reduce our water consumption in these areas especially. In  addition to our general water conservation efforts, we have also worked to reuse and recirculate water, through  methods such as pure water recycling and the reuse of rainwater. We are continuing our efforts to effectively  use water resources in the Environmental Action Plan (Stage X).      FY 2022 Performance  Targets under the Fujitsu Group Environmental Action Plan   (Stage X)  FY2022 result  Adding policies to reduce water consumption and reducing water usage  by at least 30,000 m3 by the end of FY 2022.

We implemented these policies at each business site, plant, etc., so that we could make more efficient use of  our water resources. As a result, in FY 2022 we reduced our water usage by 114,000 m3, which is 380% of the  target of 30,000 m3 as was set in the Fujitsu Group Environmental Action Plan (Stage X).    Water Usage in FY 2022 was 6.15 Million m3★ (a 11% Reduction Compared to  the Previous Fiscal Year)  The total amount of water we used in FY 2022 was 6.15 million m3 (output level per sales amount: 166 m3/100  million yen), a reduction of 11% compared to FY 2021. Additionally, 3.86 million m3 of that usage was recycled  water, which was an increase of 14.3% in comparison to FY 2021. The total amount of water we used declined,  so recycled water comprised 62.8% of our total water usage, a 13.8%pt increase from FY 2021.

We reviewed the questions we posed on our  environmental survey forms so that we would be able to understand the status of our suppliers' activities and  their actual circumstances, and identified the challenges we will face in expanding our activities in the future.                                As many businesses are connected in the global supply chain, conservation of water resources is a relevant  issue for any company. The first step in working to conserve water resources is to comprehend exactly what  water risks are associated with one's own company. In our FY 2022 environmental survey, 28.7% of suppliers  said that they were conducting water risk assessments, which is an increase from 25.7% last year. There was a  Environmental Action Plan  Activities to Conserve Water Resources in  the Upstream Portion of the Supply Chain  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 186 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  5-3-4-25  © Fujitsu 2023  decrease in the percentage of responses from suppliers stating that conservation of water resources was not  relevant to their operations compared to FY 2021, including “no water risks” (down from 23.6% to 19.4%) and  “no need to conduct assessments” (down from 22.7% to 20.2%). Meanwhile, the response of not knowing how  to assess water risks increased from 17.2% to 19.4%. We believe this is a reflection of increased awareness  among suppliers that water risk assessments are an essential part of business operations.  In order to have suppliers think about conservation of water resources as a more familiar issue, we are offering  the ''Water Risk Assessment for Companies'' document, which compiles materials on topics such as the  importance of risk assessments, and introduces publicly available assessment tools. In the future, we will  request that even more suppliers conduct water risk assessments and request that they work to conserve water  resources.    “Water Risk Assessment for Companies” can be downloaded from the following sites.

Viewing the delivery of a nature-positive world as essential to  addressing this issue, the G7 Summit held in June 2021 agreed on a G7 2030 Nature Compact, which includes a  commitment to “halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030”. Part 2 of the 15th Conference of the Parties to the  UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD-COP15) held in December 2022 adopted the Kunming-Montreal  Global Biodiversity Framework, which includes international targets for 2030. The framework establishes “23  Global Targets for 2030” aimed at the 2030 Mission “To take urgent action to halt and reverse biodiversity loss to  put nature on a path to recovery for the benefit of people and planet” (excerpt). Business groups such as the  World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and international environmental NGOs such as  the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) have also announced a joint proposal with a target of achieving a nature- positive planet by 2030. Thus, it is now considered vital that we not only have carbon-neutral initiatives to counter  climate change, but also integrated measures aimed at delivering nature-positive outcomes.    To deliver nature-positive outcomes, we have established a vision and a mid- term goal in line with international targets  Committed to delivering nature-positive outcomes, in 2022 the Fujitsu Group formulated its vision for 2050, its  2030 Mid-term Target, and its 2025 Short-term Target (Environmental Action Plan Stage XI) in line with  international targets (Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework).   Vision for 2050: Create a world in harmony with nature, where ''nature and biodiversity,'' which are  fundamental to a sustainable society, are fully restored through digital technology.   2030 Mid-term Target: Reduce negative impacts on biodiversity by at least 25% (Base year : FY2020) in the  area of company's corporate activities, including supply chain, and promote activities to increase positive  impacts on it.   2025 Short-term Target: Reduce negative impacts on biodiversity by at least 12.5% (Base year : FY2020) in  the area of company's corporate activities, including supply chain, and promote activities to increase  positive impacts on it.    We will continue to implement activities to reduce negative impacts and increase positive impacts on  biodiversity.

In FY2022, we established a calculation method that uses the Ecological Footprint, (hereinafter referred to as  ''EF'') selected as an indicator to assess negative impacts on biodiversity, to facilitate the comprehensive  evaluation of all corporate activities. We used the method to identify significant negative-impact factors in EF  assessment in association with the Group's corporate activities.       FY2022 Initiatives in Detail  Establishment of a calculation method that uses Ecological Footprint, an  indicator for assessing the negative impacts of corporate activities on  biodiversity  The Fujitsu Group selected EF as an assessment indicator for the following reasons:  1. EF is a component indicator for Target 15 of the Global Targets for 2030, proposed by SBSTTA-24, selected  based on scientific findings.  2. All corporate activities can be comprehensively evaluated.     CO-CHAIRS’ SUMMARY AND PROPOSED LIST OF INDICATORS FOR CONSIDERATION IN DEVELOPING  THE MONITORING FRAMEWORK  FOR THE POST-2020 GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY FRAMEWORK    Source: CBD/SBSTTA/REC/24/2, March 27, 2022    In working on the calculation method, we used the Business & Biodiversity Interrelationship Map® (provided by  Japan Business Initiative for Biodiversity (JBIB)) as the basis for extracting items that depend on and also have an  impact on biodiversity, and determined the corresponding Activity Amount items, as set out in the table below.

We used life cycle inventory (LCI) data to convert resource use and some of the other Activity Amount items to  Corporate Activity items corresponding to EF coefficients. Where an EF coefficient cannot be directly used for  certain Corporate Activity items such as use of water resources, this is reflected in the EF calculation by using  additional conversion logic based on scientific knowledge and expanded from the original EF.

Use of water resources account for the remaining 8%,  mainly attributable to energy consumption. We are  therefore able to establish that CO2 emissions and  energy consumption together account for 99% of  factors. This means that activities aimed at reducing  GHG emissions, such as energy conservation and the  introduction of renewable energy, can also reduce the  Ecological Footprint. In short, this is evidence that the  Group’s climate change measures are proving  effective in reducing the negative impact on  biodiversity. The FY2022 results showed a 4 %  reduction in comparison to FY2020 (*1).     *1 EF coefficients are fixed for comparison.

Therefore, we will ensure to keep all organizations in the group informed about the Code of Conduct  guidelines in the Fujitsu Way.  Furthermore, in all our business activities, we shall be aware of and act with integrity at a high level of corporate  ethics that respect international and local standards.   ===== PAGE 205 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023  FUJITSU-PUBLIC  5-4-1  © Fujitsu 2023    WHAT FUJITSU ASPIRES TO BE  Ensure that all officers and employees within the Fujitsu Group conduct their business activities with  a high level of compliance awareness, and through those activities the Fujitsu Group becomes a  trusted corporate group that is chosen by stakeholders for investment, business transactions, and  employment and that fulfills its role as a model for society.  GOALS FOR FY2025  To ensure that the entire organization is familiar with the Fujitsu Way Code of Conduct, relating to  compliance, the Global Compliance Program (GCP) will be implemented throughout the Group to  instill a high level of awareness toward compliance. The management team will take the lead in  fostering a corporate culture where no employees tolerate any kind of misconduct (Zero Tolerance).  We will expand our corporate activities in accordance with the GCP and also seek the  understanding of all stakeholders involved in our business  •  Send out annual messages on the importance of compliance from management in Fujitsu's  head office, including the CEO, and from the heads of Group companies in each country  •  Provide annual compliance training to more than 100 business partners  •  Prevent bribery and cartels from occurring    GOALS FOR FY2022  To further disseminate compliance-related part of the Fujitsu Way Code of Conduct throughout the  entire organization, the Global Compliance Program is rolled out for the entire Fujitsu Group,  thereby instilling a high level of compliance awareness in the organization, and the management is  to take the lead in fostering a corporate culture where each employee does not tolerate any  wrongdoings (Zero Tolerance).  •  Deliver messages from the President or the Heads of each Business Group/Region on the  importance of compliance (at least once a year)        Policies and Structure for Implementation  The Fujitsu Group has a compliance division under the General Counsel and carry out measures based on the  Global Compliance Program (GCP) in cooperation with compliance offices in each region. In addition to  fostering a corporate culture that each employee does not tolerate any wrongdoing, the Group is also  implementing activities to promote a high level of compliance among all stakeholders in Fujitsu’s business,  including business partners. The results of these activities are reported to the Risk Compliance Committee,  which was established based on “Policy on the Internal Control System” (*1), and raising awareness and  ensuring of the Fujitsu Way Code of Conduct in Fujitsu Group are implemented in cooperation with the Board  of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members.  In each region, raising awareness and ensuring of the Fujitsu Way Code of Conduct are implemented in  cooperation with the Region Risk Compliance Committee established as a subcommittee of the Risk  Compliance Committee.  The operational status of the Global Compliance Program is regularly reported to the Risk Compliance  Committee, the Region Risk Compliance Committee, and the Board of Directors. The development and  operation of internal rules, education, and monitoring systems to comply with various laws and regulations  related with Fujitsu Group’s business are promoted under the practice and supervision of management.    *1 Policy on the Internal Control System (p.5-p.8)      Compliance    Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 206 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  5-4-2  © Fujitsu 2023  Fujitsu Way Code of Conduct  The Fujitsu Way contains a Code of Conduct, which outlines the  fundamental principles that all Fujitsu Group employees should  abide by, as shown on the right.  Fujitsu has also refined its Fujitsu Way Code of Conduct, by  developing the Global Business Standards (GBS) (*2) in 20  languages to serve as a guide on legally compliant behavior for  all Fujitsu Group-affiliated employees worldwide, and applies the  GBS uniformly across the Fujitsu Group.    *2 Global Business Standards     Our employee evaluation criteria include assessing the level of  an employee’s embodiment of “Our Values” under the Fujitsu  Way. One of the values is for employees to act with ethics,  transparency and integrity. As such, employee personnel  assessment and compensation reflect their level of compliance  with the Code of Conduct.     Fujitsu Way   Financial Well-being      Global Compliance Program  Fujitsu has developed the Fujitsu Global Compliance Program (GCP) to implement and disseminate the Fujitsu  Way Code of Conduct and the GBS, and is working to maintain and improve the Fujitsu Group’s global legal  compliance structure. The GCP organizes our various compliance-related activities into five pillars in a  systematic manner. The GCP promotes external understanding of Fujitsu’s compliance structure and its  compliance activities, in addition to clarifying what items Fujitsu needs to address on a continual basis. Based  on this GCP, we implement various policies and initiatives in each region, taking into account factors such as  each country/region’s the legal systems and government institutions guidelines.  When implementing the GCP, we establish internal Group rules and assign a compliance officer in each region  to be responsible for compliance activities and ensure the structure’s implementation. We also continuously  provide employees with various forms of training, with the goal of embedding the Fujitsu Way Code of  Conduct and the GBS. In addition, we have established an internal whistleblower system in the event of  compliance issues, and employees are required to immediately report compliance violations to the Risk  Management & Compliance Division if they are discovered. We periodically verify the effectiveness of the GCP  through measures such as risk assessment, audit, and reviews by external specialists, and continuously work  towards improving the GCP.          Fujitsu Way Code of Conduct  Global Compliance Program  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 207 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  5-4-3  © Fujitsu 2023  1. Establishing Policies and Procedures  Fujitsu Group's minimum requirements for internal rules that must be established by Fujitsu Group companies  have been put together as the Fujitsu Group Global Policy. This policy establishes norms, rules, etc., after taking  each country’s law, culture, customs and other characteristics into account.  We have instituted the Rules for Compliance with the approval of the Risk Management & Compliance  Committee, and expanded the Rules for Compliance into Japanese Group companies with the aim of  thoroughly ensuring compliance and sustainably improving corporate value. In particular, under the above rule,  we have established more specific, detailed rules and guidelines in the areas with significant impact on  business; namely, antitrust law, anti-bribery, and antisocial forces.  For non-Japanese Group companies, in addition to the Fujitsu Group Global Policy, we have formulated global  guidelines based on the approval of the Risk Management & Compliance Committee, and have had these  guidelines adopted into the internal rules of each non-Japanese Group company. In addition to issuing General  Compliance Guidelines which correspond to the above Rules for Compliance, we have also issued global  guidelines which relate to competition laws and various guidelines which pertain to bribery prevention.  With regard to bribery and conflict of interest, in addition to principles defined in the GBS, we have established  various internal rules that state the advance application and approval processes required for actions such as  providing gifts and hospitality to government officials , receiving gifts and entertainment from business  partners by our employees, giving donations, sponsorships and charitable contributions to various  organizations, including political organizations, and facilitating payments. We also conduct compliance checks  of organizations that receive donations and sponsorships. Furthermore, as one measure for conducting advance  surveys and evaluation of transaction risk in regions and fields that are at a high risk for corruption, we perform  due diligence at the time of starting new transactions. We screen our suppliers through steps such as requiring  suppliers to complete questionnaires according to their risk level. We also require partners to abide by laws and  regulations through contracts and other means.  Moreover, we have a new global rule that details the GBS principles regarding conflicts of interest, and have  clarified specific matters to be addressed and their assessment criteria in FY2022.    2. Top-Level Commitment and Securing of Resources  Top management expresses its intentions to strive for compliance proactively and continuously through  measures such as sending messages to employees. In doing so, Fujitsu puts the Code of Conduct and the GBS  into practice and spread them throughout the entire Fujitsu Group.  The President himself has repeatedly sent out messages to all employees, both in Japan and overseas,  declaring that Fujitsu will put an end to compliance violations such as collusion and the formation of cartels.  Even overseas, regional heads and Group company top managers continuously send out messages  emphasizing the importance of compliance and a corporate culture that has zero tolerance for wrongdoing.  Furthermore, Fujitsu established the annual Fujitsu Compliance Week which begins on December 9th runs until  December 15th, to coincide with ''International Anti-Corruption Day''(December 9th). During that week,  compliance messages are simultaneously sent to employees by top management (including the CEO) at Fujitsu  headquarters and the Heads of each business region, and Presidents of group companies in each country. We  also release annually updated Compliance e-Learning to employees of all Group companies, and provide  compliance-related activities planned for each region.  Additionally, we have assigned staff in charge of compliance operations in each region, and have formed a  global network composed of staff in charge of risk compliance at each Fujitsu Group company. Based on these  steps, we have established a system for operation of our Global Compliance Program. In FY2022, officers  responsible for compliance in each region visited Japan for a discussion on a future global compliance policy.  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 208 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  5-4-4  © Fujitsu 2023    3. Training and Communication  The Fujitsu Group continuously conducts various training and communication activities for executives and  employees in order to embed and implement the Fujitsu Way Code of Conduct, the Global Business Standards,  and other internal rules.  We provide Compliance e-Learning for all Fujitsu Group executives and employees every year. The contents of  this e-learning includes risk areas such as bribery, collusion, fraudulent accounting, and security export control.  Moreover, in order to reflect the results of risk assessment and social conditions, the Compliance Division at  Fujitsu headquarters and compliance staff from each region conduct an annual review of the e-learning. In  2022, compliance e-learning was conducted in 14 languages for all Fujitsu Group executives and employees  (approximately 120,000 people). As of April 2023, 96.8% of all executives and employees have already taken  the course.  In addition to the measures listed above, we conduct timely online training and e-learning in accordance with  the risk level of each organizational level, region, and division. The training and e-learning is based on laws,  customs, and actual business conditions in each country. Every year, Fujitsu and domestic Group companies  hold compliance training sessions targeted at newly appointed executives. This training is conducted by  lawyers from outside Fujitsu, and the company's legal and compliance divisions. For managers, we periodically  conduct internal training where in-house instructors explain the importance of the Code of Conduct and  compliance, in addition to discussing typical scenarios and difficult situations. We have also implemented  compliance education as part of training for new employees. In addition to ensuring that new employees  understand the importance of the Fujitsu Way Code of Conduct and the Global Business Standards, we  continually provide education that focuses on specific risks in organizations such as sales divisions and legal  division. In FY2022, we conducted compliance training for approximately 1,300 partner companies.    4. Reporting and Responding to Incidents  Establishing an Internal Whistleblower System  The Fujitsu Group has established an internally and externally accessible portal, operated as Fujitsu Alert, to  receive internal whistleblower reports and consultation (including anonymous reports) from all Group  employees (including board members, retirees, temporary transfers, contracted employees, part-time  employees, dispatch workers, and others) and offer consultations. Group companies also maintain and operate  separate internal whistleblower systems.  Through a web form or telephone hotline, Fujitsu Alert accepts reports on suspected wrongdoing or concern  from all Fujitsu Group employees and external parties relevant to the Fujitsu Group, including customers and  suppliers (anonymously, if applicable). Fujitsu Alert is available in 14 languages 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  Fujitsu Alert is also used to communicate (including submission of additional materials and receipt of  comments from the Compliance Division) with the whistleblower regarding the contents of the investigation.  We have established a Compliance Line for Suppliers in Japan in order to receive reports from the suppliers  who directly supply products, services, software and other goods to Fujitsu and domestic Group companies.  Overseas, Fujitsu Alert also accepts reports from customers, suppliers, and other third parties.     Fujitsu Alert   Compliance Line for Suppliers in Japan    Compliance officers’ meeting  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 209 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  5-4-5  © Fujitsu 2023  Fujitsu Alert is publicized to employees via periodic messages, compliance training sessions, websites, and  posters. In addition, Fujitsu periodically confirms trends in the usage of Fujitsu Alert in order to ensure increased  recognition for and confidence in the systems among employees.    Protection of Whistleblower  Employees are encouraged to report breaches or potential breaches of compliance of which they become  aware. Furthermore, if employees are unsure of the appropriate action to be taken, they can seek advice from a  supervisor in their division or a specialized division such as the legal division.  Anonymous reports can be submitted to Fujitsu Alert, and we handle information with the utmost care in order  to preserve anonymity. Even in cases where the whistleblower is indirectly identified during investigation  process, we strictly prohibit the adverse treatment of whistleblowers due to their reports, and any such adverse  treatment will be regarded as an extremely serious breach of internal policies.    Response to Reports  When a breach of compliance is reported on Fujitsu Alert, we will conduct an internal investigation under the  supervision of responsible managers who are licensed attorneys, and will cooperate with external attorneys  when necessary. Fujitsu directly reports the results of its internal investigations to the Board of Directors and  the Risk Management & Compliance Committee. These reports are made independent of the division and/or  affiliated companies which are involved in the subject matter under investigation. Depending on the content of  the report, the Compliance Division may delegate an investigation to other authorized divisions if deemed  appropriate.  The Compliance Division will conduct an appropriate internal investigation in order to understand the facts and  review possible countermeasures in accordance with applicable laws and professional standards. The internal  investigation includes, but is not limited to, consideration of applicable laws, consideration of appropriate  investigation steps, evaluation of collected evidence, documentation of investigation results, and reporting or  escalation. Depending on the results of the investigation, Fujitsu provides feedback to the whistleblower if  necessary based on applicable laws such as the data protection laws and business laws.  In the event that the investigation has verified problems according to the Code of Conduct, Global Business  Standards, or other internal rules, we take corrective measures such as disciplinary action and reflect the results  in personnel evaluations. In order to prevent similar problems from occurring in the future, we remind all parties  of rules, revise systems, strengthen monitoring and supervision, and take other necessary measures.  The process for these investigations, etc., is also reviewed and improved at least once a year, including at the  time of establishment of the annual plan under the Global Compliance Program and/or at the time of  enactment or amendment of relevant laws.  Fujitsu may be either required by law or decide based on business judgement to provide information about  compliance violations to certain government and/or judicial agencies (including, but not limited to, government  investigative agencies or courts). When making such decisions, Compliance Division staff work together with  managers and other relevant divisions as necessary.  Moreover, letters or emails received via platforms other than Fujitsu Alert are also reviewed for investigation of  suspected compliance breach and corrective measures and response are taken as needed.    Total of Reports to Fujitsu Alert and Breakdown  In FY2022, 88 reports were submitted to Fujitsu Alert. Of these, there were no confirmed cases of corruption  (bribery included) or legal disputes. The Fujitsu Group takes measures to prevent corruption following its  Global Policy on Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption (*3) and thoroughly complies with the laws and regulations  of each country.

In addition, we periodically report to the Risk Management &  Compliance Committee, the Board of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members concerning internal  whistleblower reports and consultations, as well as our responses to major compliance issues. Please refer to  the Fujitsu Group Integrated Report for the number of meetings of the Risk Management & Compliance  Committee and the Board of Directors.    5. Monitoring and Reassessment  The Fujitsu Group conducts annual verification of the effectiveness of the Global Compliance Program through  reviews of our risk assessment and internal auditing activities, and through reviews by external experts such as  law firms. We are also working to continuously improve our Global Compliance Program based on the results of  applicable reviews and audits, as well relevant social conditions. Please refer to the Risk Management page  regarding our risk assessment activities.  The Compliance Division of Fujitsu headquarters continually assesses risk that mainly targets Group companies  located in overseas countries and regions with a high risk of corruption. Through interviews with  executives/employees and verification of internal rules and business processes, the Compliance Division  analyzes the compliance risks of local businesses. It then proposes countermeasures in accordance with the  actual contents and extent of risks, and supports the implementation of those countermeasures.  The status of risk assessment and implementation of the Global Compliance Program are periodically reported  to the Risk Management & Compliance Committee, the Regional Risk Management & Compliance Committees,  and the Board of Directors. The discussions and decisions made at these meetings are reflected and  implemented in a timely manner to activities in the Global Compliance Program.

In Japan, regulations for security  export controls are implemented under the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act (the Foreign Exchange  Act).  In line with the Fujitsu Way Code of Conduct’s stipulation that employees should comply with all laws and  regulations, Fujitsu has enacted “Internal Compliance Program” on Security Export Control Regulations whose  fundamental objective is the promotion of security export controls that are not only in accordance with the  Foreign Exchange Act, but with the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) of the United States, which are  applied extraterritorially.  Fujitsu has established a system in which the President serves as the designated Chief Security Export Control  Officer, while the Security Export Control Office in the Corporate Governance and Compliance Unit serves as  the organization that promotes security export control activities. The Security Export Control Office carries out  all classification and transaction screening (verifying the country/region receiving the goods/technology, the  intended application for it, and the identity of the client) for export of goods and the transfer of technology to  overseas locations, where all necessary licenses are adequately obtained before shipment. In addition, in the  “Internal Compliance Program” such process is established that legal violations shall be reported immediately.  When conducting business, in order to prevent legal violations by misinterpretation of and/or overlook of  related regulations, we coordinate closely with the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, which has  jurisdiction over export administration regulations.  In order to maintain this internal system for security export controls and keep it going, we continue to conduct  regular audits and provide export controls training to all executives and employees.  With regard to all domestic and overseas Group companies, Fujitsu headquarters offer guidance about how to  develop rules and establish frameworks for proper security export controls, provides educational support and  audit support, and organizes gatherings within the Group for the purpose of information exchange, among  other activities. In addition, since FY 2013, Fujitsu has been developing an e-Learning course that covers  security export controls and is available in 20 languages for Group companies around the world.      System to Ensure Proper Financial Reporting  In the “Policy on the Internal Control System”, which was resolved by the Board of Directors, Fujitsu stipulates  the following points.     The Company has, apart from the organization that prepares financial reports, an organization under the  Chief Financial Officer responsible for establishing, operating, and evaluating internal control over Fujitsu  Group financial reporting, to ensure the effectiveness and reliability of financial reports.   These organizations create rules for establishing, operating, and evaluating internal control over the unified  accounting policies shared throughout the Fujitsu Group and financial reporting.   The organization responsible for establishing, operating, and evaluating internal control over financial  reporting periodically reports to the Board of Directors and any other relevant person or organization the  results of evaluations on the effectiveness of the internal control.    Status of operations  The organization responsible for internal control and internal audits has established the system and assesses  internal control over financial reporting throughout the Fujitsu Group, and reports the activity status and  assessment results to the Representative Director and CEO, Chief Financial Officer, Audit & Supervisory Board  Members and the Board of Directors in accordance with the principles of the “Practice Standards for  Management Assessment and Audit concerning Internal Control Over Financial Reporting” published by the  Business Accounting Council.

We understand the purpose and essence of each country’s tax laws and treaties, as well as other guidelines  such as those laid out in the Business Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project led by the OECD, and abide by  them. We strive to file tax returns and pay taxes appropriately. In transactions between related companies, we  will comply with the general rule of an arm’s length price and distribute profits appropriately.    Tax Governance  The Director who serves as the Chief Financial Officer is responsible for the proper filing and fulfilment of tax  returns and obligations, management of tax risks, and optimization of tax expenses. Important matters and risks  related to tax are reported to the management meeting and Board of Directors in a timely and appropriate  manner for approval.    Transfer Pricing  We comply with the principle of arm's length pricing and distribute profits appropriately when conducting  transactions between affiliated companies. We do not transfer business profits generated in countries/regions  to countries/regions with low tax rates where we do not conduct business transactions.    Tax Planning  We do not engage in tax planning that is solely for the purpose of avoiding taxes without business purpose or  business substance. Similarly, we will not use tax havens to transfer profits with the intention of avoiding taxes.    Relation with Tax Authorities  We strive to build a sound relationship with the tax authority in each country by conducting our business with  ethics, transparency, and integrity in accordance with Our Values under the Fujitsu Way.

In 2005, we formulated the ''CSR Procurement Guideline” for CSR procurement and requested our suppliers in  Japan and overseas to comply with that guideline. In 2018, we adopted the RBA (*1) Code of Conduct as the  ''Fujitsu Group CSR Procurement Guideline''.    *1 [PRESS RELEASE] Fujitsu Joins EICC, a Global Corporate Social Responsibility Coalition (renamed as the Responsible Business  Alliance (RBA) in October 2017)     Fujitsu Group Procurement Policy   Fujitsu Group CSR Procurement Guideline (RBA Code of Conduct)    Supply Chain    Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 217 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  5-5-2  © Fujitsu 2023  Structures for Promoting CSR Procurement & Periodic Reviews  Under the group-wide policy, the relevant departments in the Fujitsu Group collaborate regarding the  promotion of CSR activities. In the area of procurement, the Global Supply Chain Unit works with the relevant  departments in promoting socially responsible procurement activities by suppliers. The CSR promotion  activities are targeted at our major suppliers, that is, the largest suppliers on a monetary basis and those who  have ongoing dealings with Fujitsu.  We initially clarify the compliance items through its CSR Procurement Guideline and then require our suppliers  to undertake CSR activities. To confirm that these CSR activities are being fully implemented by suppliers, they  are asked to respond to a range of surveys on topics such as green procurement, information security and  Business Continuity Management (BCM).  The survey responses are analyzed and the results are returned to the suppliers as feedback. Where a supplier  fails to meet Fujitsu’s standards, they undertake to make improvements. Where there is a particular need to  check whether CSR activities are being fully implemented by a supplier, a CSR audit is conducted. Such  suppliers are required to submit a remediation plan for any matters identified by the audit and Fujitsu works  with the suppliers to make the necessary improvements. Fujitsu is continually improving its processes and  promoting CSR procurement with the goal that ultimately CSR activities will be properly undertaken by  suppliers and will become firmly entrenched.        Promoting Activities and Participation in Industry-standard Initiatives (RBA  Membership)  The Fujitsu Group is a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), a global CSR alliance. As such, we  give serious consideration to the RBA’s Code of Conduct and engage in socially responsible procurement with  our suppliers and throughout our supply chain.  The Fujitsu Group also takes an active role in the programs and initiatives of organizations such as the Japan  Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA) and works to promote socially  responsible procurement in the industry.    Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 218 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  5-5-3  © Fujitsu 2023  Addressing High-Risk Minerals  The policy of the Fujitsu Group is to exclude  from its products, components and supply  chain any minerals that give rise to conflicts  (“conflict minerals”), or minerals that are at  high risk of being associated with forced labor  or human rights violations. (The Fujitsu Group  identifies tantalum, tin, gold, tungsten and  cobalt as high-risk minerals.) Fujitsu has also  established a structure to ensure the  transparency of procurement activities in the  supply chain and the responsible  procurement of minerals. This structure  includes the relevant internal departments  and operates under the jurisdiction of the  Sustainability Management Committee  (chaired by Fujitsu’s CEO).     Fujitsu Group Policy on Responsible Minerals Procurement    Surveys on High-Risk Minerals  As part of its due diligence, the Fujitsu Group conducts high-risk minerals surveys with reference to the “OECD  Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas”.  These surveys use the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT) and Extended Minerals Reporting  Template (EMRT) developed by the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI).     List of smelters checked in the surveys    Reminders are sent to those suppliers who failed to respond to our survey by the due date. If survey responses  reveal insufficient answers, suppliers are asked to resubmit their responses. Where customers indicate that a  smelter is considered to be “risky”, we ask suppliers using that smelter to re-examine the nature of their  dealings with the smelter.  While there have been no confirmed reports yet of smelters having any involvement with armed groups, we  will continue to conduct programs aimed at identifying smelters and further increasing transparency in our  supply chain.      Promoting Green Procurement  The Fujitsu Group has set out its basic approach to the environmentally sound procurement of components,  materials and products in the Fujitsu Group Green Procurement Direction, and we are working with our  suppliers to promote green procurement activities. One target for such activities is the reduction of CO2  emissions, and the Fujitsu Group is requesting that its suppliers, and their suppliers in turn, set targets and  promote activities to reduce their CO2 emissions. In addition, we are asking our suppliers to conduct water risk  assessments as a first step toward water resource conservation. We will continue to promote activities that  reduce environmental impacts throughout our supply chain.     Fujitsu Group Green Procurement      Promoting Information Security Measures  Based on the “Cybersecurity Management Guidelines” issued in December 2015 by Japan's Ministry of  Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and the Information-technology Promotion Agency (IPA), the Fujitsu  Group, along with its suppliers, has adopted the goal of “eliminating information security incidents”, and is  continually implementing measures to prevent such incidents or recurrences. These measures include  education, raising awareness, auditing and sharing information.  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 219 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  5-5-4  © Fujitsu 2023  In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the commercial use of external services such as cloud  computing and social media. There has also been a rapid increase in opportunities for the use of smart devices  such as smartphones and tablet PCs. Since FY2020, there have been major changes to workplace  arrangements to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, notably a rapid rise in teleworking (working  from home). Regarding the risk of information leaks, it is necessary to prevent not only incorrectly addressed  emails being sent by mistake and the theft or loss of PCs and smart devices, but also new kinds of risks such as  in-house crimes and cyber terrorism. In this context, when the Fujitsu Group consigns work to suppliers,  including those outside Japan, it promotes education and awareness by requiring the same standards of  information security management and handling of personal information as it applies to its own operations. If  any serious problem regarding information security is discovered at a supplier, or if the supplier fails to  immediately implement corrective measures and no improvement is observed, Fujitsu will take steps such as  reviewing its business relationship with the supplier.      Enhancing Supply Chain BCM  The Fujitsu Group sees the enhancement of Business Continuity Management (BCM) throughout its supply  chain as essential to ensuring a stable supply of products and services in the event of major disasters or other  unexpected contingencies. Accordingly, since FY2007 we have provided our suppliers with ongoing support to  improve their BCM capabilities.  Fujitsu conducts an annual questionnaire-based survey of its suppliers on how they address BCM. This survey  also covers some group companies that conduct their own procurement. We analyze the responses to the  survey and then provide feedback to the suppliers and group companies. Since FY2014, we have been using a  standard survey form developed by JEITA’s Materials Committee.  Fujitsu also conducts annual surveys of major solutions-related suppliers, analyzing the responses and providing  feedback.      Communication with Suppliers  Feedback of Assessment Results in the Suppliers' Performance Review (SPR)  System  Under the SPR (*2) System, the Fujitsu Group targets primarily its major suppliers and provides direct feedback  on the assessment results. Suppliers whose efforts do not meet Fujitsu’s standards are asked to make  improvements. Fujitsu also carries out assessments of solutions-related suppliers and provides the results of  those assessments as feedback to the major suppliers.    *2 Suppliers’ Performance Review: A program developed by Fujitsu that assesses the performance of procured goods and the basic  profile of enterprises in terms of quality, technology, price, supply and CSR.    Fujitsu ActivateNow Partner Summit  The Fujitsu Group has held events for its suppliers since 1997. We have held our global flagship event, Fujitsu  ActivateNow Partner Summit (*3) , in an online format since FY2020. Senior executives and the heads of  business groups give an overview of Fujitsu’s business direction, and the Executive Vice President responsible  for purchasing shares the activities undertaken with partners.  This event is also an opportunity to present certificates of appreciation to partners who make exceptional  contributions to our business and to further strengthen our partnerships with suppliers.    *3 Fujitsu ActivateNow Partner Summit: A reorganized event that replaces the previous Fujitsu Suppliers’ Reception and the Fujitsu Group  Core Partner Forum.

Supplier Compliance Line  The Fujitsu Group uses the Supplier Compliance Line as a channel to receive reports from suppliers regarding  any actions that are potential or actual instances of non-compliance in our purchasing activities. Channels have  been set up both internally and externally through which we can verify and investigate the facts of each report  and respond quickly.  Fujitsu’s internal reporting standards prohibit any adverse treatment of its own staff making such reports or of  staff from suppliers making the reports.  Our agreements with suppliers also include explicit provisions on the elimination of anti-social forces and other  such groups with the aim of preventing harmful actions by such anti-social forces (and avoiding any  encouragement of their activities). The Fujitsu Group, including its suppliers, will have no relationship  whatsoever with anti-social forces.

Supporting to provide the learning opportunity to young people living in South America's  largest slum (U.K.)  – Chamos – * NGO based in U.K. which supports children in Venezuela.          For many young people living in Petare in Venezuela, one of the biggest slums in South America, studying and  prioritizing education is close to impossible. School dropout rates are high; opportunities to turn to drugs or  crime are common; and very few young people progress to higher education.  Chamos has been working with a local non-profit, Queremos Graduarnos (QG), to incentivize school  attendance with children and young people. Fujitsu’s funding enabled to provide scholarships for 55 young  people to participate in this program in the 2022/23 academic year. This grant has provided the students with a  scholarship for school fees, and a stipend to buy educational resources, food and transport, removing barriers  to attending school and teaching money management.  As part of the Chamos QG programme, students can attend personal development workshops twice a month  and can even volunteer to help with other programmes, e.g.: acting as mentors for other students, and helping  Chamos with the construction of a new Chamos playground for a local primary school.  Most excitingly, Fujitsu provided a virtual workshop to some of the students, introducing coding and why these  skills are important for future career prospects. The knowledge and inspiration gained were invaluable, and we  are scoping out how best to support students who have expressed their interest in learning more in this area  for their futures.  Fujitsu has been able to provide real and tangible support for 55 young people who otherwise would have  lacked the resources and support to attend school.

The principle  that companies have a responsibility to all of their stakeholders is becoming more common worldwide, to  include not just customers and investors, but employees, suppliers, and communities of all sizes.  Fujitsu supports this principle and is working towards the realization of a sustainable society, acting in  conjunction with international organizations and a variety of like-minded companies.      Involvement with the World Business Council for Sustainable  Development (WBCSD)  The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) is the community  of over 200 companies around the world that aims to realize Vision 2050, '' a world in  which more than 9 billion people are able to live well, within planetary boundaries''  (*1) working to accelerate the system transformations through business activities.  Fujitsu has been participating in the WBCSD since 2013, and CEO Tokita is currently  serving the community as a member of its Executive Committee.  In 2022, the WBCSD’s Council Meeting was held in Tokyo  under the theme ''The era of sustainability: how to lead the  transformation and thrive'', bringing together more than  250 executives from around the world. Representing  Fujitsu, CEO Tokita spoke at the Opening Plenary, and  Yoshinami Takahashi, Corporate Executive Officer, SEVP &  Head, Global Business Solutions, took the stage at a session  on “Toward zero-emission mobility & buildings operation”.

With more than 30 companies participating, we deepened discussions on how  executive leadership should respond to various global issues such as climate emergency, nature loss, mounting  inequality, and requests for information disclosure, and the role expected of Japanese companies to pave the  way toward sustainable business success. On the last day of the meeting, more than a dozen participants were  invited to the Fujitsu Uvance Rooftop Executive Briefing Center at the Fujitsu headquarters, where we  introduced sustainability-related businesses and advanced technologies and held a discussion.

We updated the policy in September 2023 and, adopting the stance that the aim of corporate governance is to  ensure better management, we constantly review the policy to ensure that it does not become rigid or lose its  relevance. We also discuss it with the Board of Directors as appropriate, and strive to maintain the best  corporate governance system at all times.     Corporate Governance Policy    Corporate Governance Structure (as of June 26, 2023)  In accordance with its Corporate Governance Policy, the company outlines the following rules to ensure  effective oversight and advice, given from the diverse perspectives of Non-Executive Directors (hereinafter, the  term used for a combination of Independent Directors and Non-Executive Directors appointed from within the  company), to Executive Directors on their business execution as part of the Board of Directors function while  taking advantage of the company through the Audit & Supervisory Board system.    Board of Directors  The Company has a Board of Directors to serve as a body for making important decisions and overseeing  management. The Board of Directors delegates the decision-making authority over business execution to the  Representative Directors and subordinate Corporate Executive Officers to the broadest extent that is permitted  by law and the Articles of Incorporation of the company and is considered to be reasonable and will mainly  perform as oversight and advisory function. Moreover, the Board of Directors has been formed with Non- Executive Directors at its core so as to enable correction and remediation of errors, insufficiencies, and  recklessness in business execution. And by ensuring that External Directors, who are highly independent and  hold diverse perspectives, constitute the majority of the members of the Board of Directors, the oversight and  advisory function of the Board of Directors is strengthened. Furthermore, in order to better define the  management responsibility of the Directors, their terms were reduced from two years to one year in  accordance with a resolution at the June 23, 2006 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting.  As of June 26, 2023, the Board of Directors consists of nine members in total, comprising three Executive  Directors and six Non-Executive Directors (including five External Directors).  The Company held 13 Board of Directors meetings in FY2022 (including one extraordinary Board of Directors  meeting) to discuss matters including formulation of the Management Direction and measures for its  implementation, as well as to decide a new management system based on the recommendations of the  Executive Nomination Committee.    Audit & Supervisory Board  The Company has an Audit & Supervisory Board that performs the auditing and oversight functions. The  auditing and oversight functions are carried out by Audit & Supervisory Board Members, who review the Board  of Directors as well as business execution functions and attend important meetings, including meetings of the  Board of Directors. As of June 26, 2023, the Audit & Supervisory Board has five members, comprising two full- time Audit & Supervisory Board Members and three External Audit & Supervisory Board Members. The  Company held ten Audit & Supervisory Board meetings in FY2022 (including one extraordinary Audit &  Supervisory Board meeting), mainly to discuss audit policy and plans, the audit method of Accounting Auditors  and the appropriateness of the audit results, and the Key Audit Matters. Internal Audit Departments made  reports and full-time members of the Audit & Supervisory Board reported matters of importance to External  Audit & Supervisory Board Members, which were discussed at Audit & Supervisory Board meetings.  All meetings were attended by the full Audit & Supervisory Board.  Corporate Governance  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 234 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  6-1-2  © Fujitsu 2023  Independent Directors & Auditors Council  In response to the requirements of Japan’s Corporate Governance Code, which facilitates the activities of  Independent Directors and Auditors, and in order to invigorate discussions on the medium- to long-term  direction of the Company at its Board of Directors Meetings, the Company believes it essential to establish a  system that enables Independent Directors and Auditors, who maintain a certain degree of separation from the  execution of business activities, to consistently gain a deeper understanding of the Company’s business. Based  on this recognition, the Company established the Independent Directors and Auditors Council, which consists  of all Independent Directors and Auditors (five Independent Directors and three Independent Auditors), and  discusses the medium- to long-term direction of the Company, shares information, and exchanges viewpoints  so that each can formulate their own opinions.  In FY2022, the Independent Directors and Auditors Council met 12 times. The members shared information and  exchanged views on important management matters arising from business restructuring in Fujitsu and the  Fujitsu Group, including the Company’s management direction and mergers and acquisitions.    Executive Nomination Committee & Compensation Committee  The Company has established the Executive Nomination Committee and the Compensation Committee as  advisory bodies for its Board of Directors for the process of nominating Directors and Audit & Supervisory  Board Members, for ensuring the transparency and objectivity of its process for determining executive  compensation, to enable efficient and substantial discussions, as well as to ensure the fairness in the structure  and level of executive compensation.  The Executive Nomination Committee deliberates on the candidates for Director and Audit & Supervisory  Board Member positions in accordance with the Framework of Corporate Governance Structure and the  Procedures and Policy for the nomination and dismissal of Directors and Auditors stipulated in the Policy, and it  provides its recommendations or proposal to the Board of Directors. In addition, the Compensation Committee  provides its recommendations or proposal on the level of base compensation and the method for calculating  performance-based compensation to the Board of Directors in accordance with the Procedures and Policy of  Determining Directors and Auditors Compensation, as stipulated in the Policy.  The Executive Nomination Committee consists of three Non-Executive Directors (including two Independent  Directors) and the Compensation Committee consists of three Independent Directors. The members appointed  to the two committees in June, 2023 are as follows. Additionally, the secretariats of both committees are  operated by the Company’s HR and legal departments.     Executive Nomination Committee  Chairperson: Atsushi Abe (Independent Director)  Members: Yoshiko Kojo (Independent Director), Masami Yamamoto (Director and Senior Advisor)     Compensation Committee  Chairperson: Chiaki Mukai (Independent Director)  Members: Kenichiro Sasae (Independent Directors), Byron Gill (Independent Directors)    In FY2022, the Executive Nomination Committee met eight times to discuss the election of Representative  Directors including the CEO, the nomination of candidates for Director, and the skill matrix of Directors and  Auditors, etc. and provided its recommendations to the Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee met  six times to discuss the revision of executive compensation details and changes to the process for determining  individual compensation, and provided its recommendations to the Board of Directors.  The Executive Nomination Committee discussed CEO succession and mutual evaluations of Non-Executive  Directors, and the Compensation Committee discussed the introduction of the stock compensation plan for  External Directors.

The company adopts “the  company with Audit & Supervisory Board system”, which establishes an Audit & Supervisory Board composed of  Audit & Supervisory Board Members appointed as independent agents.  Moreover, the Board of Directors has been formed with Non-Executive Directors at its core so as to enable  correction and remediation of errors, insufficiencies, and recklessness in business execution. External Directors  also constitute the majority of the members of the Board of Directors. The core of Non-Executive Directors  shall be External Directors with a high degree of independence and diverse perspectives. Moreover, at least  one Non-Executive Director is appointed from within the Company to complement the External Directors’  knowledge in the business fields and the culture of the Company, so that the efficiency of oversight  performance by the Non-Executive Directors is enhanced.    Policy for Determining Executive Compensation  Compensation paid to Directors and members of the Audit & Supervisory Board is determined based on the  policy on the determination of the details of compensation, etc. for individual Directors established by the  Board of Directors, subject to approval by the Compensation Committee.

Uncertainties that might affect the achievement of these objectives are  considered to be risks. To address these risks, the Fujitsu Group established a Risk Management & Compliance  Committee based on the Policy on the Internal Control System determined by the Board of Directors. The  Committee reports directly to the Board of Directors and oversees risk management and compliance for the  entire Fujitsu Group.   Chaired by the CEO and composed of Board Members, the Risk Management & Compliance Committee  continually assesses and verifies risks that could result in losses to the Fujitsu Group and implements risk  control measures such as formulating preventive measures for materialized risks in business execution. To  minimize losses arising from the materialization of risks, and in an effort to prevent their recurrence, the  Committee regularly analyzes the risks that have materialized and reports to the Board of Directors.   In addition, the Risk Management & Compliance Committee has established a Regional Risk Management &  Compliance Committee in each region outside of Japan to operate as subordinate committees in a global  structure. The committee also assigns Risk Management & Compliance Officers to the business units, group  companies and regions for both Japan and overseas. These organizations collaborate to build a risk  management and compliance structure for the entire group.            Risk Management  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 239 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  6-2-2  © Fujitsu 2023  Furthermore, to strengthen the risk management functions of the Fujitsu Group, we created the Corporate Risk  Management Office, which reports directly to the CEO and is independent of the business units. This body  carries out the secretariat functions of the Risk Management & Compliance Committee and, under the  leadership of the Chief Risk Management Officer (CRMO), is responsible for interpreting risk-related  information and spearheading rapid, appropriate responses where required.  Based on the initiatives taken to date, we have appointed a Chief Quality Officer (CQO) as the person  responsible for quality for the entire Group, as we believe that Company-wide and cross-organizational  measures led by top management are more essential than ever to further strengthen measures and ensure  effectiveness. Furthermore, we have enhanced the structure and functions of our Risk Management &  Compliance Committee, chaired by the CEO, and have strengthened this framework to ensure constant and  thorough Company-wide responses.  Specifically, the CQO will be included as a member of this committee, which has been the venue for  deliberations on important risk compliance issues related to the Fujitsu Group. This framework was established  in which concrete measures are determined and promptly implemented, including Company-wide measures  related to information security and system quality, as well as responses to individual events. By establishing  such a framework, we could thoroughly implement risk management led by the CEO, assigning more  strengthened authority than ever to the CISO and CQO to supervise the process, including different CxO areas  such as personnel systems and investment resources. Additionally, to ensure the rapid and effective  implementation of measures, the committee is held every month.    Main Business Risks *  •  Economic and financial market trends  •  Customers  •  Competitors and the industry  •  Investment decisions and business  restructuring  •  Suppliers, alliances, etc.  •  Public regulations, public policy and tax  matters  •  Natural disasters and unforeseen  incidents  •  Finance  •  Deficiencies or flaws in products and  services  •  Compliance issues (including human  rights risks)  •  Intellectual property  •  Security  •  Human resources  •  Fujitsu Group facilities and systems  •  Environment and climate change    *  These are just some examples of the risks associated with doing business. More detailed risk-related information can be found  in our securities and other reports.   https://pr.fujitsu.com/jp/ir/secreports/  Please refer to the web page below for detailed risk information in accordance with our Task Force on Climate-related Financial  Disclosures (TCFD) declaration.   “Response to Environmental Risks”      Processes  After identifying and reviewing the key risks associated with business activities from among the various risks  around the Fujitsu Group’s operations, every year we investigate, analyze, assess, and visualize the possibility of  key risks occurring, the potential impact, the status of measures, and so on.   Based on the assessment outcomes, the Risk Management & Compliance Committee confirms the key risks,  issues instructions on further measures, and reports to the Board of Directors. The policies and measures  determined by the committee are fed back to the entire Group, and the risk management departments  established for each key risk then appropriately manage the measures across the Group as part of efforts to  minimize risks.   Information obtained through the potential risk management process is disclosed to stakeholders via such  documents as securities reports and the Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book.   In addition, when a risk materializes, the committee has established mandatory rules such as rapid escalation to  the Risk Management & Compliance Committee in accordance with risk management regulations, and ensures  that all employees are aware of these regulations to raise awareness of risk management.  By implementing such process and confirming by the risk management department on a quarterly basis, we  aim to reduce risks across the Fujitsu Group and to minimize the impact when risks become apparent.    Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 240 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  6-2-3  © Fujitsu 2023          Risk Management Education  To enforce risk management across the entire Fujitsu Group, we conduct education and training at every level.   These programs are targeted at newly appointed executives and managers, as well as others, to educate them  on our basic approach to risk management and our rules for promptly escalating issues to the Risk  Management & Compliance Committee. The programs present specific instances relating to products, services,  and information security, with the aim of continually improving participants’ awareness of risk management and  enhancing their capacity to respond to risks.   Refer to the “FY2022 Performance” section for information on education outcomes for FY2022.    Group-Wide Disaster Management  The basic policy of Fujitsu and its group companies in Japan is to ensure the safety of staff and facilities when  disasters occur, to minimize harm and to prevent secondary disasters. We also aim to ensure that business  operations resume quickly, and that we can assist in disaster recovery for our customers and suppliers. To this  end, we are building robust collaborative structures in our internal organizations and strengthening our  business continuity capabilities.   In particular, we are working to build “area-based disaster management systems” that enable the Group offices  in each region to cooperate effectively and to promote responses via the management structures in each  business unit and group company.   To verify the efficacy of our disaster management systems and enhance our response capabilities, we conduct  drills tailored to every level, from the entire company through to task forces, workplaces and even individuals.  We also implement voluntary inspections and verification activities to prevent accidents and minimize the level  of harm in each of our facilities. These efforts enable us to accurately identify existing issues and review and  implement measures to address those issues, thereby allowing us to work toward continually improving our  capacity to prepare for disasters and sustain our business operations.

Such events include earthquakes, floods and other large-scale natural disasters, disruptive  incidents or accidents, and pandemics involving infectious diseases. To ensure that Fujitsu and its group  companies in Japan can continue to provide a stable supply of products and services offering the high levels of  performance and quality that customers require, even when such unforeseen circumstances occur, we have  formulated a Business Continuity Plan (BCP). We are also promoting Business Continuity Management (BCM) as  a way of continually reviewing and improving our BCP.  Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, to maintain the safety of its customers, suppliers and employees, and their  families, the Fujitsu Group has placed the highest priority on preventing the spread of the infection. It is also  promoting initiatives to sustain the supply of products and services to customers and to help resolve the many  societal issues that have arisen due to the spread of the infection.  For more information on our BCM activities, infectious disease countermeasures and BCM in our supply chain,  please refer to the PDF listed below, and for activity outcomes for FY2022 refer to the “FY2022 Performance”  section.

These drills are used to  ensure and to verify that Fujitsu and its group companies in Japan are fully versed in the essentials of dealing  collaboratively with major disasters. (Proposed scenarios include “Tokyo Inland Earthquake” and “Nankai Trough  Megathrust Earthquake”.)  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 242 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023  FUJITSU-PUBLIC  6-3-1  © Fujitsu 2023  Policy  Fujitsu Group appointed dedicated Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) in October 2021. Under the new  information security regime, we are striving to secure and improve information security for our customers  through our products and services, while also ensuring the information security of the entire Fujitsu Group.      Management Structure  We have established Regional CISOs in Japan and three international regions (Americas, Europe and Asia  Pacific) under the CISO to implement globally consistent security policies and measures. They align the  headquarters’ policies with security requirements specific to each country to bolster information security  through our globally integrated system.  We have also been building a system to strengthen the CISO’s control over relevant departments to achieve  the ideal state of information security by assigning security managers in charge of autonomous information  security enhancement of each department in Fujitsu Headquarters and its group companies inside and outside  Japan.  Specifically, our security manager system ensures that each department has an “Information manager,” who  oversees the management and protection of information; an “System Security Manager,” who supervises the  maintenance and management of information security system; and a “Product Security Incident Response  Team (PSIRT) Manager,” who leads product vulnerability management, so that they can promote various  information security measures in cooperation with the CISO.          Information Security  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 243 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  6-3-2  © Fujitsu 2023  Information Security Initiatives  Our Goals for Information Security  With the rapid increase in more skillful and more sophisticated cyber-attacks, enhancing information security  has become an urgent issue for national economic security and for corporate economic activities.  We have set up our goals for information security as described below. To achieve them, we respond to cyber- attacks with ever-evolving advanced information security and by continuing to reform the awareness of each  employee and our organizational culture as it is the key to success. Together with relevant departments and  employees, we are developing processes, rules, and systems to promote cybersecurity and working to  strengthen information security for the entire Fujitsu Group as well as a safer business environment for our  customers and partners.    Our Goals for Information Security  •  Proactive information security  - Continuous evolution of information security to support diverse work styles in the age of digital  transformation (DX)  - Autonomous information security response by employees and organizations  •  Defensive information security  - Cyber-attack prevention by addressing vulnerability  - Enhanced monitoring to minimize cyber risks in case of emergency    Initiatives  Cross-departmental Application of Recurrence Prevention Measures and Visualization of Security Risks  In response to information security incidents involving our project information sharing tool, “Project WEB” and  cloud service, “FJcloud-V/NIFCLOUD”, we have been applying recurrence prevention measures across different  departments under the dedicated CISOs’ system. By 2022 we had completed the application of one of the  principal recurrent prevention measures, “multi-factor authentication of web systems” in Japan. We also  continue to promote corrective measures by visualizing security risks through company-wide security  inspections.  In 2023, we will continue our efforts to achieve our goals for information security by taking appropriate  corrective measures through visualization of security risks and evolving information security based on the  following major themes:    What Visualization of Security Risks Can Achieve  •  Autonomous risk control by internal relevant departments  Objectively visualized risks related to information management and information system security are  reviewed and promptly addressed by relevant department within the company. In case of critical  system or information, an organization under the direct control of CISOs conducts direct inspection to  objectively confirm the risk content with more accuracy.  Moreover, the information management literacy of each employee and the organization (internal  factors) and the actual status of cyber-risks (external factors) are also visualized and shared (Visual  control). Having each employee understand this and take this personally (developing a sense of  ownership) fosters an organizational culture of autonomous information security measures (taking  initiatives).  •  Accurate correction of digitally visualized risks  Introduction of CMDB (*1) and Information Management Dashboards (*2) allows digital visualization of  information system vulnerability and information management deficiencies. Correcting the visualized  risks mechanically, not manually, minimizes security risks accurately and speedily.    (*1)  CMDB：Configuration Management Database  CMBD is a database that automatically collects and centrally manages information systems’ configuration information of  hardware, software, network, etc.  The collected information is utilized for security inspections and audits, handling vulnerability, and responding to security  incidents.  (*2)  Information Management Dashboard: digitalized information management register.  The Fujitsu Group maintains a digitalized information management register, which controls managers, management locations,  and scope of sharing of the confidential information.  Any deficiencies detected through consistency checks between the Dashboard and the actual information management status  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 244 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  6-3-3  © Fujitsu 2023  (such as audit logs of storage services) will be readily and quickly corrected through a trouble ticketing system, or set a  workflow for the solution.    •  Evolution of information security with technology  From 2023, we will unify our authentication infrastructure to promote centralized and visualized  management of user IDs, authorization information and trail logs.  With this authentication infrastructure, we will seek to conduct behavior analysis using trail logs and  optimize authorization information in conjunction with the analysis results.    Main Measures  We will introduce the main measures tied to each theme from the following three perspectives.  •  Cyber-security  Introduction of information system security (or ensuring and maintaining the safety and reliability of  information systems and networks), as well as measures related to activities to maintain the security of  our products and service  •  Information management  Introduction of measures to maintain and manage the confidentiality, integrity and availability of  information itself, including critical information (confidential or personal information)  •  Governance enhancement  Introduction of measures to strengthen governance to instill and establish security measures and  enhance the security of the entire organization.          Cyber Security  Based on the IT asset management information of Fujitsu’s systems, we will bolster preventive measures against  security compromises by providing perimeter defense and zero-trust security not only to block any  unauthorized access by an attacker, but also to detect and take defensive actions in the event of such intrusion.    Measures Linked to Centralized IT Asset Management  Autonomous Correction Through Centralized and Visualized IT Asset Management  To support our customers’ safe, secure, and sustainable business activities, we have centralized and visualized  the IT asset management of the IT systems for our globally operating customers, as well as our internal ones.  This helps us promptly identify and correct any security risks throughout the group. We have been  strengthening routine risk management, visualizing risk audits conducted by an organization under the direct  control of the CISOs and their result, and promoting an appropriate understanding of the actual situation in  relevant departments and their autonomous correction.    Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 245 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  6-3-4  © Fujitsu 2023      Vulnerability Scanning of Systems Exposed to The Internet  We provide vulnerability scanning mechanism in systems exposed to the Internet from the outside based on IT  asset management information. This enables our relevant departments managing those systems to conduct  autonomous periodic scans and take corrective actions triggered by vulnerability detection. By conducting  periodic inspections through this mechanism on annual basis, we ensure implementation of countermeasures  against vulnerabilities. Moreover, we inspect critical systems with more accuracy through third-party audits  conducted by an organization under the direct control of the CISOs. In 2023, we will promote the automation  and mechanization of this process.  Furthermore, we have also established a mechanism to ensure that vulnerabilities of systems not exposed on  the Internet are thoroughly addressed, by regularly updating IT asset management information, checking it  against the vulnerability database, and, in case of any critical vulnerability, issuing tickets (corrective tasks) to  responsible department.    Utilization of Threat Intelligence and Attack Surface Management  We are proactively utilizing threat intelligence to speed up the detection of, and response to, vulnerabilities in  systems exposed to the Internet. Threat intelligence enables us to collect information in the early stage of an  actual attack from an attacker’s perspective, such as information on global threat trends and vulnerability as  well as vulnerability information in Fujitsu Group’s systems exposed to the Internet. The obtained threat  intelligence allows impact analysis and prompt corrective action.  Moreover, in combination with vulnerability scanning of Internet-exposed systems based on IT asset  management information, we also implement attack surface management, which monitors system  vulnerabilities from an attacker’s perspective.        Thorough Monitoring  The cyber security environment is constantly changing, and attack methods are becoming more complex and  sophisticated. Under these circumstances, the Fujitsu Group takes a zero-trust approach, based on the concept  that 100% prevention of intrusion by cyber-attack is impossible, to reinforce security monitoring. We will  improve the internal guidelines for security monitoring and conduct periodic system inspections to grasp and  visualize the current situation. We will also work to ensure a sound monitoring system to enhance detection  capabilities and earlier response to cyber-attacks. Furthermore, we ensure that critical systems are thoroughly  monitored through third-party inspections conducted by an organization under the direct control of the CISOs.    Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 246 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  6-3-5  © Fujitsu 2023  Response to Incidents  As a company that supports customers’ safe and secure business activities, we must respond immediately to  cyber-attacks that are becoming increasingly skillful and sophisticated. To that end, we have created an  incident response process on the premise that a contingency is inevitable, so that in such cases our  organization can quickly implement the series of processes of escalation to higher levels, response, recovery,  and notification.    1. Escalation process  We have standardized, and are continuously improving, the process of calculating an impact of each  incident risk and escalating accordingly, to bolster the organization’s ability to respond to any incident.  2. Incident response and system recovery process  After receiving information on attacks and vulnerabilities, we will take actions for prompt recovery by  formulating a system recovery plan that includes appropriate incident handling, patch application plan and  business continuity plan (BCP) for the affected product or system.  3. Notification process  To ensure accountability to our stakeholders, we strive to properly share and report incident information.  4. Activities to have the processes take root in the organization  The Fujitsu Group conducts regular education and training on incident response to raise employees’  awareness and implement activities for the incident response processes to take root.        Sophistication of Incident Response  Responding to a security incident requires an accurate understanding of the event from a technical perspective  through log analysis, malware analysis, disk forensics, and other methods. A quick and fitting response also  requires determining an overall policy and collaborating with parties involved inside and outside the company.  In our company, technical experts and members who take the lead on the path to the solution work together  to handle security incidents, following various processes, including the escalation process.  In addition, we have been accumulating information on attacker’s tools, processes, and access methods and  improving technical knowledge and skills of our response team members through continuous training. We also  review the incidents we, including our global group companies, have handled to continuously improve our  response capabilities, including upgrading our structure, rule and processes and accumulating know-how, so  that we can speed up our response and minimize the impact.    Risk Prevention in Our Products and Services  PSIRT Manager System  To protect our customers who use our products and services, we have assigned PSIRT Managers in internal  relevant departments to be responsible for centralized management of information on product configuration,  IT asset and threat intelligence, including vulnerability information, as well as for vulnerability response. This is a  system that enables speedy and proactive response to risks caused by vulnerabilities in our products and  services.    Formulation of Processes  To accelerate estimation of the risks to products and services, as well as consideration and execution of  countermeasures against them, we created standards and processes to handle the risks caused by  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 247 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  6-3-6  © Fujitsu 2023  vulnerabilities. We are continuously improving those processes based on statistical analysis by data scientists  and track record of our responses.  Earlier problem resolution through prompt vulnerability response based on these systems and processes will  prevent secondary damage to customers and minimize the impact on their business continuity.          Information Management  Fujitsu Group in Japan implemented the Information  Protection Management System in order to appropriately  protect third-party confidential information (including  personal information) and our confidential information. We  also apply a PDCA cycle from the “(1) Roles & Responsibilities”  to ”(7) Review”. In order to clarify information assets that must  be protected, we establish appropriate management  according to the status of our customers and suppliers, and  take initiatives for protecting information. These steps are  taken for the autonomous information protection activities  (regulations by industry, business type, etc.) conducted by  each division while unifying the classification of information on  a global scale.  Furthermore, we provide various automation support tools  that utilize information management dashboards to support  appropriate information management. We make  improvements as necessary to realize operations that are both  effective and safe.  The main activities of the Information Protection Management System are described below.    Information Protection Management System  (1) Roles & Responsibilities  Under the CEO, we are building a system to manage and protect information through a global network that is  centered on the CISO and overseen by the CEO. We appoint management staff for each department, clarify  roles, and promote the appropriate handling of information.    (2) Policies & Regulations  In order to handle information correctly, we have formulated necessary rules, procedures, and an annual activity  plan. We also periodically review our policies and rules, including responding to legal amendments.    (3) Training & Awareness  In order to improve the awareness and skills of each employee, we provide necessary information according to  employees’ positions and roles. We also hold various training sessions and disseminate information in response  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 248 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  6-3-7  © Fujitsu 2023  to changes in the work environment (for example,  telecommuting, etc.).  Every year, we carry out information management  education (e-Learning) for all employees including  executives, and publish internal information management  learning materials that can be studied at any time.  *Number of participants in 2022: 37,343    (4) Self-Inspection  We identify and classify our information assets, conduct  risk analysis, and carry out periodic inventory check.    (5) Incident Response  We have established a system for fast and appropriate  response to information management incidents. We have  also set up escalation routes, procedures, etc., on a global  scale.    (6) Audit  The Information Management Promotion Division confirms  the status of information management for each division  from a third-party perspective. It also gives instructions  and suggestions for corrections and improvements.    (7) Review  We are working to improve and review our Information Protection  Management System by considering external opinions (including audit  results, incidents, and complaints), law revisions, and changes in the  environment.    Protection of Personal Information  Fujitsu has established a global Personal Information Protection System to  strengthen the protection of personal data. Under the leadership of the  organization under the direct control of the CISOs and the Legal Division, we work  with each region and Group company to comply with the laws and regulations of  each country, including the GDPR (*1). In regard to the handling of personal  information, we post and announce privacy policies on public sites in each country.    (*1) GDPR: General Data Protection Regulation  A European regulation that was put into effect on May 25, 2018 and that requires  companies, organizations, and groups to protect personal data. Includes rules on the transfer  of personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA), the obligation to report within  72 hours of a data leakage, etc.    In Japan, with the objective of protecting personal information, Fujitsu Group obtained certification for the  PrivacyMark (*2) by the Japan Information Processing and Development Center (JIPDEC) in August 2007. We are  continually working to strengthen our Personal Information Protection System. Our domestic Group companies  also obtain the PrivacyMark as necessary and work to thoroughly manage personal information.    (*2) The PrivacyMark  The PrivacyMark is granted to businesses that handle personal information appropriately under a personal information  protection management system that is in compliance with JIS Q 15001:2017.    In FY2022, Fujitsu Customer Service Center Personal Information Protection Desk did not receive any  consultations or complaints regarding customers’ privacy. No customer information was provided to  government or administrative agencies in accordance with the Act on the Protection of Personal Information.      Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 249 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  6-3-8  © Fujitsu 2023  Acquisition of Information System Certification  Fujitsu Group is actively promoting the acquisition of third-party evaluation and certification in our information  security efforts.     Third-party evaluation/certification audit results (link)      Governance Enhancement  We are working to minimize security risks through a multifaceted approach to enhance global security  governance.  To ensure common governance in the global group, we clarify what must be done by “(1) making policy  requirements mandatory,” and make sure “(2) thorough application by system governance” under the  Information Security Management Structure. By organically combining these with “(3) execution of inspections  and audits,” mentioned earlier, and “(4) problem detection through ASM,” we realize reliable security measures  that each department can carry out autonomously.  In addition, by “(5) visualizing risks and maturity levels“ along with metering of security maturity levels, we  foster a culture of taking security measures autonomously and thus promote self-purification effect of cyber- security measures.        Metering of Security Maturity Levels  Fujitsu evaluates the security maturity levels of organizations by automatically collecting and scoring  infrastructure configuration values, security logs, audit data and other data. By visualizing the maturity level of  each department at Fujitsu Headquarters and each group company on a monthly basis, we foster a culture of  autonomous implementation of specific measures and corrective actions based on an understanding of the  current situation and differences from targets, and thus promote self-purification effects of cyber security  measures in each department.  Inspired by the C2M2 (*1), or Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, and SIM3 (*2), or Security Incident  Management Maturity Model, both of which have been proven in Japan and overseas, our security maturity  level evaluation indicators incorporate a unique method of scoring maturity mechanically from data taken from  security measures. The evaluation score is capped at 100 points. The maturity levels are scored on six axes:  governance, human security risk management, system security risk management, information asset risk  management, incident detection and response capabilities, and organizational culture and mindset. In 2023, we  will conduct 8-axis evaluation, adding external organizational collaboration and supply chain risk management.

Fujitsu Group Standards for Information Security Measures  The first is the formulation of “Fujitsu Group Standards for Information Security Measures” which set the  standard security measures in the group. Consisting of more than 200 management measures based on the  global standards NIST’s CSF (*1), SP800-53 (*2) and ISO/IEC27002, it will establish rules for the application of  management measures according to the importance of information systems and other factors. We are also  preparing materials such as manuals and guidelines to support the application of such management measures.    Risk Management Framework  The second is the development of “Risk Management Framework,” a framework for security risk management in  the group. Based on the global standards NIST’s SP800-37 (*3), the framework will establish a set of processes  to identify and manage security risks of each organization and information system in a systematic and  appropriate manner. It will establish rules for periodic risk management in each organization and risk  management in the development and operation phases of each information system. We will incorporate these  processes into the Fujitsu Group’s various business processes to ensure that they are well understood and  widely accepted.  By sharing these two initiatives within the Fujitsu Group and executing a series of processes of “Risk  Management Framework,” we will apply management measures based on the “Fujitsu Group Standards for  Information Security Measures” to each organization and information system, while we will run a continuous  improvement process. This will help us with our pursuit for effective implementation of security measures and  realization of “security by design.”    (*1) CSF：Cybersecurity Framework  (*2) SP800-53：NIST SP800-53 Rev.2 Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations  (*3) SP800-37：NIST SP800-37 Rev.2 Risk Management Framework    Security Training, Development of Mindset, Human Resource Development  and Maturity of Responsible Personnel  As one of the measures to support the improvement of security maturity levels, mentioned above, we are  working on security education and training. Particularly, we focus on preventing the recurrence of recent  incidents. For example, our company-wide mandatory information security education program shares the latest  trends of security threats and incident cases and informs trainees of the lessons learned from the past incident  responses and the measures that were supposed to be taken, in order to develop a security mindset and  strengthen skills of each employee.  In addition, we hope that regular information sharing by the CISOs and an organization under their direct  control within the company, as well as vitalization of security managers’ community, will contribute to creating a  Visualized Graph of Security Maturity Levels (sample)  Company Maturity  Maturity Score Trends (Entire Company)  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 251 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  6-3-10  © Fujitsu 2023  corporate culture that does not allow information management and security measures to take a backseat to  business convenience and cost reduction. To achieve this goal, we are working on the following:    <Security Education and Training>  In addition to basic education on information management and cyber-security, we thoroughly disseminate the  lessons learned from the latest trends and incident responses. We also work to improve the skills of our  professional personnel by issuing guidelines on system monitoring for system managers. As 100% prevention  of incidents is difficult, we have changed from efforts not to allow contingencies to happen, to efforts that take  contingencies into consideration. As a part of such efforts, we conduct incident response training for  employees. For instance, we annually provide system engineers (SEs) and business producers involved in  business and internal operations with practical training under a scenario of an incident. In the event of an  incident with a social impact, we also conduct incident training for executives and relevant departments to  ensure a quick response and minimization of the impact.  In addition, we carried out targeted e-mail drills twice in the FY2022 to promote the security mindset in each  employee. We will continue this drill at least once a year.    <Strengthening the Security Management Structure and Human Resource Development>  Fujitsu Group will work to reform each department’s security-related way of thinking and behavior by having  the CISO and an organization under their direct control periodically share information within the company,  assigning security managers to support each department, and stimulating their community.  In 2023, we redefined the image of security personnel, especially that of security managers working in the  field. We also reviewed our professional certification system. After clarifying their functions and responsibilities,  we revised the system, including the compensation system, and have been reinforcing the security system in  organizations in the field of Japan ahead of schedule since January 2023.  We also strive to better the security maturity level of each department lacking security-related experience by  sharing with it their actual status visualized through the above-mentioned “metering of security maturity levels”  and by having the security managers’ community communicating with it periodically.

These are all based on the Fujitsu Way. As a result, each of the  Fujitsu Group’s businesses provides safe and secure products/services supporting the businesses and lifestyles  of various customers including developing social infrastructure.  The Fujitsu Global Quality Policy represents a way of thinking, shared across the entire Group, for implementing  a value system which holds the Fujitsu Way in high regard, “Trust: We contribute to a trusted society using  technology.”   This quality policy was established in order to continue providing our customers with products/services that  they can feel secure using, but also to define quality as a foundational part of our business, and come to a  shared understanding of the policy worldwide.        Fujitsu has established the Fujitsu Group Quality Charter under the Fujitsu Group Global Policy, as well as five  quality assurance-related regulations (such as Shipment, Registration, and Release Regulations, as well as  Safety Promotion Regulations), in order to implement the Fujitsu Global Quality Policy in Japan.   All of our measures, from planning to design to verification, production, sales, and even follow-up support, are  based on this charter and these regulations. This ensures that we continue to provide products/services that  stay one step ahead of our customers and any changes in their business landscapes.    Implementation Policy for the Safety of Our Products and Services  The Fujitsu Group recognizes its social responsibility to contribute to building a safe and secure society. The  Fujitsu Group always considers and endeavors to improve the safety of products and services in every aspect of  the group's business activities.    1. Observation of laws and regulations   We observe laws and regulations concerning product and service safety.  2. Efforts to secure safety   We try to ensure that products and services are safe in a variety of use situations and take measures as  necessary to secure the safety of the products and services. In addition to legally specified safety  standards, we develop and observe voluntary safety standards in our endeavors to improve products and  services continuously.  3. Prevention of incidents caused by improper use, etc.   Quality Initiatives  Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 253 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  6-4-2  © Fujitsu 2023  For the safe use of products and services by customers, we properly display notices and warnings in  handbooks or on the body of the products in order to prevent incidents caused by improper use or  carelessness.  4. Collection of incident information, etc.   We actively collect safety-related information from customers, including information on product and  service incidents and what might lead to such an incident.  5. Handling of incidents   We immediately check the facts of any occurring incident related to a product or service, investigate the  cause, and handle it properly. If the product or service has a safety problem, we provide that information to  customers and take proper measures, such as product recall, service recovery, and prevention of further  damage and other damage from occurring. We quickly report the occurrence of major product incidents  to the proper authorities in accordance with laws.      Our Quality Management Structure  The Fujitsu Group appointed a Chief Quality Officer (CQO) in June 2023 in an effort to enhance the quality of  our products/services across the entire Group.   Furthermore, Fujitsu established Quality Management Representatives in each business organization, region  and Group company to monitor Groupwide quality management under the leadership of the CQO. Following  the decision-making of the CQO, the Global Quality Management & Assurance Unit formulates shared policies,  standardization, and quality improvement measures as the headquarters of quality. By deploying these shared  measures through Quality Management Representatives, we are working toward providing products/services  with consistent and optimal quality for our customers all over the world.   In addition to working with individual divisions and regions with regards to their quality assurance efforts, we  also coordinate across the entire Group to share knowledge and information that transcend organizational  boundaries. This helps us make better use of these efforts, and allows us to solve quality assurance issues that  are shared across organizations.   This sharing of effective quality assurance efforts increases the overall quality of Fujitsu’s products/services, and  helps to prevent issues from occurring and reoccurring.          Our Quality Support Framework  In order to provide a level of quality for our products and services which meets the needs and expectations of  our customers in a consistent way, it is essential for us to coordinate with various organizations inside and  outside Fujitsu—including business units, common business units, and business partners—from planning and  design through development, manufacturing, testing, sales, operations, and up until maintenance. Frameworks  and mechanisms to integrate these organizations are essential as a foundation for our efforts.   This is why we built our Quality Management System (QMS): to coordinate among these business units as  appropriate for the product or service. Our QMS periodically verifies the progress in light of international  certification standards such as the ISO in the aim of achieving process improvements to realize even higher  quality.

Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 255 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  6-4-4  © Fujitsu 2023  (1) Policies and measures   Objectives are set and reviewed, and quality  measures for achieving them are planned and  rolled out across the entire Fujitsu Group. In  addition to internal control using regulations  and rules, quality processes are also  standardized to ensure a stable quality.    (2) Implementation and monitoring   The projects of each business are monitored to  ensure that business is executed following  quality measures, rules and standardized  processes. In case a quality concern arises, the  situation is rectified or improved through audits  and inspections. Additionally, training is  provided to continuously increase employee skill levels.    (3) Response to issues   If a problem related to product/service quality is found, the matter is managed as a quality incident and prompt  action/measures are taken. In the case of a serious quality incident, following the Risk Management  Regulations, the matter is immediately reported from the field to the Risk Management & Compliance  Committee at the Fujitsu headquarters, and under the committee’s instructions, the relevant departments  address the incident jointly and consider ways to prevent recurrence. The recurrence prevention measures are  shared with other departments through Quality Management Representatives in an effort to prevent the same  incident from occurring at other Fujitsu Group companies.    (4) Evaluation and reporting   Our approach to quality is regularly examined and analyzed, with consideration also made toward additional  measures if necessary. After reporting updates to executive management on a regular basis, action is taken  following their decision making and instructions. This cycle is then repeated following a short timeline in an  effort to improve quality through an all-hands-on-deck approach including executive management and the  heads of business organizations.   Additionally, through Qfinity (*1) activity, good/best practices are commended and shared across the entire  Fujitsu Group to increase the level of quality throughout the Group.    *1 Qfinity : Qfinity, an internal branding term which combines the words “quality” and “infinity,” represents the DNA of the Fujitsu Group:  the “infinite pursuit of quality by each and every employee.” Qfinity is an improvement and innovation activity launched throughout  the Fujitsu Group in FY 2001 to continuously improve the quality of products and services, with each and every employee taking a  central role. Through Qfinity, we promote quality improvement activities in each workplace and engage in quality improvement of  products and services.      Quality Governance  Under the newly appointed CQO, we are working to strengthen quality governance across the entire Fujitsu  Group as well as prevent major incidents from reoccurring and enhancing the quality of products/services.   The process of strengthening quality governance involves rolling out a platform for risk assessment and  decision-making model within the Fujitsu Group to correctly assess risks and take thorough action against it.      Return to Table of Contents  ===== PAGE 256 ===== Fujitsu Group Sustainability Data Book 2023    FUJITSU-PUBLIC  6-4-5  © Fujitsu 2023  Strengthening the Design/Operation Platform Supporting Quality  Governance and Risk Monitoring  We will load quality-related information  that comes up in the development field,  such as progress of development projects,  test density, and defect detection rate, onto  our common platform, Fujitsu Developers  Platform. By combining this information  with Earned Value Management (EVM) and  quality indicators and conducting timely  analysis, we will build a mechanism for  assessing the quality and delivery decisions  in the development field in a more  objective manner.    Decision-Making Model  For business opportunity and projects, we have adopted a GOGI approval system (consensus to approve) led  by stakeholders. In addition to the conventional judgment of business groups/regions (sponsor), the  development departments (delivery councilor) and the Global Quality Management & Assurance Unit  (Independent audit supervisor) deliberate from multiple perspectives. Through these trilateral discussions,  decisions are made from multiple angles, not only business but also quality, technology, and resources.   We strive to provide better proposals to our customers by setting up check gates for each phase of business  opportunity and development, and making  decisions through trilateral consensus to  prevent the promotion of erroneous projects  and the occurrence of quality issues.   As connectivity increases globally, the  expectations placed on the Fujitsu Group are  also undergoing significant changes.  As we take on an increasing number of first- time business and initiatives, we utilize these  mechanisms as a foundation to make quick  and accurate decisions and prepare for various  risks.      FY 2022 Performance  Violation of Laws and Regulations Concerning Product Safety   Violation of laws and regulations concerning product safety: 0    Disclosure of Information Related to Product Safety   Number of disclosed issues: 0 major product incidents   Important notices concerning product safety   Prevention Measures for Laptop Battery Ignition Incidents  On three previous occasions, Fujitsu has asked customers to exchange and return battery packs in order to  prevent the spread of ignition incidents due to the possibility that foreign matter had contaminated the  interior of the battery during the battery pack manufacturing process.   At the same time, however, although extremely rare, there have been cases of ignition occurring in battery  packs outside those covered by the returns and exchanges.   It has been found that limiting the phenomena that increase the internal pressure of batteries is an  effective measure in preventing these types of ignition incidents.   Since February 9, 2017, Fujitsu has been offering a ''Battery Charging Control Update Tool'' through its  website for its laptop PCs launched between 2010 and 2016.

In this kind of landscape, it is vital that we maintain an accurate  understanding of our customers’ various needs and adapt quickly to changes as they arise. In order to  accomplish this, we must think and behave from the customer perspective, and engage continuously in reform.

Independent Assurance Report  To the Representative Director CEO of Fujitsu Limited  We were engaged by Fujitsu Limited (the “Company”) to undertake a limited assurance engagement of the  environmental and social performance indicators marked with ★ (the “Indicators”) for the period from April 1, 2022 to March 31, 2023 included in its Sustainability Data Book 2023 (the “Report”) for the fiscal year ended March 31,  2023.  The Company’s Responsibility  The Company is responsible for the preparation of the Indicators in accordance with its own reporting criteria (the  “Company’s reporting criteria”), as described in the Report.  Our Responsibility  Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Indicators based on the procedures we have  performed. We conducted our engagement in accordance with the ‘International Standard on Assurance  Engagements (ISAE) 3000, Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial  Information’ and the ‘ISAE 3410, Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements’ issued by the  International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. The limited assurance engagement consisted of making  inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for the preparation of information presented in the Report, and applying  analytical and other procedures, and the procedures performed vary in nature from, and are less in extent than for,  a reasonable assurance engagement. The level of assurance provided is thus not as high as that provided by a  reasonable assurance engagement. Our assurance procedures included:  Interviewing the Company’s responsible personnel to obtain an understanding of its policy for preparing the Report and reviewing the Company’s reporting criteria. Inquiring about the design of the systems and methods used to collect and process the Indicators. Performing analytical procedures on the Indicators. Examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the generation, aggregation and reporting of the Indicators in conformity with the Company’s reporting criteria, and recalculating the Indicators. Visiting the Company’s Akashi System Center selected on the basis of a risk analysis. Evaluating the overall presentation of the Indicators. Conclusion  Based on the procedures performed, as described above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to  believe that the Indicators in the Report are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the  Company’s reporting criteria as described in the Report.  Our Independence and Quality Management  We have complied with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics  Standards Board for Accountants, which includes independence and other requirements founded on fundamental  principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behavior.  In accordance with International Standard on Quality Management 1, we design, implement and operate a system  of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements,  professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.  /s/ Kazuhiko Saito  Kazuhiko Saito, Partner, Representative Director  KPMG AZSA Sustainability Co., Ltd.

Yes C1.1a (C1.1a) Identify the position(s) (do not include any names) of the individual(s) on the board with responsibility for climate-related issues. Position of individual or committee Responsibilities for climate-related issues Chief Executive Officer (CEO) CEO in charge of environmental issues is the highest standing person responsible for oversight of the Fujitsu Group's climate change-related issues through three internal structures known as the ''Risk Management & Compliance Committee'', the Sustainability Management Committee and the ''Environmental Management System''. CEO who is as a member of the Board directly receives a report from the Risk Management & Compliance Committee that is under its immediate control and supervises the committee on its responses toward key business and climate-related risks. There are procedures to identify, assess and manage the physical and transitional risks that may potentially occur in relation to climate change, together with a structure that oversees these procedures, in the Risk Management & Compliance Committee. Next, the Sustainability Management Committee chaired by the CEO discusses climate-related issues, the main agenda of the Management Council. In FY2021, for example, it was decided by the Committee to increase investment in renewable energy to achieve GHG emission reduction targets in line with the SBT 1.5°C target. In addition, the Fujitsu Group has ISO14001-based environmental management systems in place; in the systems, the Board receives reports from the ''Management Council,'' which makes the final decisions in climate strategies. CEO is transferred the authority concerning the execution of duty by the Board within the appropriate range, and has all the business execution authorities including the problem related to the climatic variation.

The Board oversees climate change issues after receiving reports on the following: - Ensuring consistency between the strategies to contribute to tackling climate change and the business strategies, through reviewing and guiding strategies - Progress management of GHG reduction actions (in accordance with its own targets such as SBT,RE100 etc.) to contribute to mitigation of the climate change through reviewing and guiding major plans of actions - Notification that climate change is perceived as a significant risk through reviewing and guiding management politics C1.1d CDP Page  of 125 2  ===== PAGE 3 ===== (C1.1d) Does your organization have at least one board member with competence on climate-related issues?

Specifically, Fujitsu’s President & CEO serves as a member of WBCSD’s Executive Committee, where he leads global-scale Sustainability Transformation (SX) efforts to address social issues, including climate issues. We also evaluate Board Members’ abilities with respect to water-related issues from the standpoint of academic expertise.

For example, Risk Management & Compliance Committee, an organization directly reporting to the Board, manages company​wide risks including climate-related risks globally. The CEO assumes the position of the  committee chairman. The chairman of ''the Sustainability Management Committee'' positioned directly below the Management Council is also assumed by the CEO.  Risk management is an example of the delegation of power by the CEO. The CEO, the chairman of Risk Management & Compliance Committee, appoints a Chief Risk Compliance Officer as an executor of decisions of the Committee and  has the Officer execute the decisions. Climate changes is a topic related to not only risk management but also various areas such as business strategy and supply chain management; therefore, the CEO who can manage several chief operating officers in specialized roles is  considered suitable as a chief executive related to climate change in the Fujitsu Group.  Regarding sustainability , the CEO is the chairman and chief executive of ''the Sustainability Management Committee'' ; however, a director in charge is appointed for the execution of specific activities.  [Description of position specific climate-related issues monitoring process] The power to execute operations of CEO is delegated to each chief representative director in the Fujitsu Group by utilizing the operating officer system. For example, for risk management, the person responsible for risk and compliance identifies, analyzes, and assesses critical risks and reports the results to the chairman, the CEO, at least twice on years for deliberation. Similarly, the CEO as the chairman of the Sustainability Management Committee makes final decisions on specific policy of climate change strategies semiannually for environmental activities, and specific management is performed under a director in charge with execution responsibilities. For example, Fujitsu is a member of the RE100 initiative. Analysis and plans on expanding the introduction of renewable energy were presented at the Management committee, and the CEO ultimately made a decision based on multiple perspectives, including the investment plan, timeline and impact. As a result, a decision was made to increase investment to proactively expand the use of renewable energy toward achieving GHG emission reduction targets in line with the SBT 1.5 degree target. C1.3 (C1.3) Do you provide incentives for the management of climate-related issues, including the attainment of targets? Provide incentives for the management of climate-related issues Comment Row 1 Yes C1.3a CDP Page  of 125 3  ===== PAGE 4 ===== (C1.3a) Provide further details on the incentives provided for the management of climate-related issues (do not include the names of individuals). Entitled to incentive Board/Executive board Type of incentive Monetary reward Incentive(s) Bonus - % of salary Performance indicator(s) Company performance against a climate-related sustainability index (e.g., DJSI, CDP Climate Change score etc.) Incentive plan(s) this incentive is linked to Short-Term Incentive Plan Further details of incentive(s) Emissions reduction project Emissions reduction target Energy reduction project Energy reduction target Efficiency project Efficiency target Behavior change related indicator Outstanding results with respect to the environment and climate change are reflected in Board Members’ annual performance evaluations. We took a new look at the bonus system for our executive directors (CEO, COO, CFO) in 2022. Our aim was to strengthen our commitment to management goals that are linked to the fulfillment of Fujitsu’s Purpose: “To make the world more sustainable by building trust in society through innovation.” This review led us to decide to add CDP, a set of third-party benchmarks on ESG, as an evaluation indicator in determining executive directors’ bonuses.  From now on, Fujitsu’s inclusion among CDP’s A List companies will be linked to the amount of bonuses paid. And since “reduction of CO2” is included among CDP’s evaluation items, the degree to which CO2 reduction efforts have progressed will affect executive directors’ bonus payment rate (by plus or minus several percent).Whether the company is on the CDP A List affects the bonus payment percentage (± a few percent) of the executive directors. Since being put on the A List is an incentive, multiple items which are asked about in CDP questions are targets for the incentive. Explain how this incentive contributes to the implementation of your organization’s climate commitments and/or climate transition plan Considering climate issues over the short, medium, and long term can lead to adaptation to and mitigation of risks as well as new opportunities to create value. Earning high marks in evaluations with respect to global indices can help build a stronger upstream presence in business negotiations. It is also conducive to expanded collaboration with business partners. C2. Risks and opportunities C2.1 (C2.1) Does your organization have a process for identifying, assessing, and responding to climate-related risks and opportunities? Yes C2.1a (C2.1a) How does your organization define short-, medium- and long-term time horizons? From (years) To (years) Comment Short-term 0 2 FY 2022- FY 2023 Medium-term 2 10 FY 2023 - FY 2030 Long-term 10 30 FY 2030 - FY2050 C2.1b (C2.1b) How does your organization define substantive financial or strategic impact on your business? We develop a scenario of climate-related risks and assess it by multiplying the five-level ranks (1 to 5 points) of ''financial impact'' (1 billion yen to 100 billion yen) and ''occurrence frequency'' ('several times per year' to 'once in ten years'). When the formula indicates the score equal or higher than the threshold value of 15, and if countermeasures are inadequate, we define it as the substantive financial or strategic impact on our business.  ([Financial impact (1-5 points)] x [Likelihood of occurrence (1-5 points)] = 15 or more on a scale of 1-25 will be considered as exceeding the threshold.) If, for example, a natural disaster such as a flood or typhoon caused devastating damages due to the impact of climate change and disrupted activities at primary sites over several months, the loss in sales could total 50 billion yen or more. However, the presumed frequency of such occurrences is considered to be no more than once in 10 years. Furthermore, solid disaster preventive measures have already been planned and implemented. When verified against the assessment criteria, this scenario does not correspond to risks that would cause substantive change in business as they fall below the threshold. C2.2 CDP Page  of 125 4  ===== PAGE 5 ===== (C2.2) Describe your process(es) for identifying, assessing and responding to climate-related risks and opportunities. Value chain stage(s) covered Direct operations Risk management process Integrated into multi-disciplinary company-wide risk management process Frequency of assessment More than once a year Time horizon(s) covered Short-term Medium-term Long-term Description of process Fujitsu group has established the Risk Management & Compliance Committee (chaired by the CEO) as the highest-ranked decision-making body for risk management and compliance directly under the Board. This committee monitors risk management conditions of Fujitsu group at least twice a year. The Committee executes integrated assessment of a comprehensive group-wide risks involving finance, customers, competitor/industry, policies/regulations, security, climate-related issues, and so on. The Committee has developed a tool for regular implementation of risk assessment, which is distributed to respective risk compliance officers who are asked to enter the answers. The tool is designed to enable officers to report on risk threat scenarios by assessing the degree of financial impact, occurrence frequency and condition of countermeasures. Short-term, medium-term and long-term risks are represented in the ''Likelihood of occurrence'' section. Using this tool, an assessment is conducted by departments in charge of company-wide, cross-sectional risks, namely: Public Policy and Business Development Office and environmental department for regulatory and market risks; marketing department and environmental department for reputational and technological risks; PR/IR Office and environmental department for investor risks; General Affairs Department, facilities management department and environmental department for physical risks.  The company-wide risk assessment outputs are aggregated with the results of asset-level assessment , and matrix analysis is performed on the consolidated results from two aspects - the degree of financial impact (up to 100 billion yen) and occurrence frequency (in the next ten years and beyond) - to identify group-wide risks that are higher on the priority ranking; then the results are reported to the Board.  Regarding potential risks such as long-term climate issues, the Sustainability Management Committee, chaired by the CEO and comprising the heads of business groups and regions, is specifically engaged in group-wide strategy planning by considering climate-related and other environmental risks and opportunities, as well as confirmation of progress. The Sustainability Management Committee held twice a year to monitor the implementation status of climate strategy including response to risks. This provides an opportunity for the CEOs and executive officers of business groups and regional heads to manage the entire company’s response status from the perspective of management execution. Given that Fujitsu delivers various ICT solutions for societal issues, addressing climate change mitigation/ adaptation is a business opportunity for our technology solutions segment 87% of sales). Each business group head analyzes opportunities and develops strategies, followed by the CEO making final decisions on a business plan and resource allocation in the Management Council.  For short-term, medium-term and long-term climate change risks and opportunities, company-wide strategies are formulated, decisions are made and progress is kept track of while considering environmental risks and opportunities that include climate change at the Sustainability Management Committee chaired by the CEO and comprising heads of business groups and regions. C2.2a (C2.2a) Which risk types are considered in your organization's climate-related risk assessments? Relevance & inclusion Please explain Current regulation Relevant, always included At present, the Fujitsu Group is subject to laws and regulations in regard to GHG emissions and energy use. Those are taken into account in our risk evaluations because the Fujitsu brand may be damaged if we violate them and costs for responsive measures may rise if they become stricter. For example, the industrial air conditioners used in all of over 100 sites in Fujitsu Japan and coolers in our semiconductor plants are applicable for the Act on Rational Use and Proper Management of Fluorocarbons. This law requires regular measurement and reporting of fluorocarbon leakage for industrial air conditioners and a report in the event the leakage exceeds 1,000 CO2-ton per year. If a leakage occurs, administrative authorities will conduct on-site inspection; unless complied, a fine of 200,000 yen will be imposed. Managing the leakage of CFC is one of the compliance items in ISO14001-based Environment Management System (EMS) of Fujitsu. All offices conduct inspections once every 3 months and large equipment run inspections on a monthly basis. Inspection results are aggregated at the environmental division through EMS's reporting procedures. Another regulatory risk is that a levy is added to electricity costs based on the feed-in tariff (FIT) system for renewable energy in Japan. FIT accounts for about 15% of energy procurement costs for Fujitsu in the country. In particular, while data centers and ICT services require power, we expect FIT's impact on procurement costs to further increase as the surcharges are projected to rise. Based on the company-wide risk management system, departments responsible for these facilities, the environmental division and the purchasing department are the main players working on power usage and costs associated with these business activities. The purchasing department compares and analyzes power rates through utilizing our procured power system in considering cost optimization with the contracted power company and cutting down CO2 emissions. The environmental division performs correlation analysis of temperature and electricity consumption, estimates energy consumption of the day based on weather forecast on the previous day, and provides information through a portal website accessible by each site. Emerging regulation Relevant, always included As an emerging regulation, carbon pricing is likely to be implemented in many countries in the world. Energy use is indispensable in continuing data center operation and production activities in plants, and that account for 80 to 90% of all energy use in the Fujitsu Group. If energy price rises due to regulatory moves, Fujitsu will need to pay for additional cost. Therefore, emerging regulation is relevant to our business and included in our risk assessment, and the trend of risk is being monitored. For example, in Japan the Ministry of the Environment holds ''A study group on how carbon pricing should be'' from 2017, discussing specific policy proposals. It has been decided that the Japanese version of carbon pricing will be gradually introduced from fiscal 2023. If carbon tax and emissions trading system (ETS) are introduced in Japan in the future, Fujitsu is likely to face an increase in costs, such as capital investment cost for energy saving (current expenditure is about 1.5 billion yen per year) , energy procurement cost, credit procurement cost, procurement cost for renewable energy and certification. For instance, if the carbon-emissions tax is introduced in Japan, it is provisionally calculated that our increases for about 1 billion yen.  For such emerging regulation risks, analysis, assessment, and management of detailed risks are performed under the company-wide risk management structure, led by Public Policy and Business Development Office and the environmental division as organizations responsible for these risks. Specifically, we collect information on trends of industrial associations and ministries and agencies. We confirm the possibility of risk emergence and timelines. We also assess financial impact on Fujitsu. Based on the results of such risk assessment in the company, we conduct lobbying activities via an industrial association. CDP Page  of 125 5  ===== PAGE 6 ===== Technology Relevant, always included Electricity use is essential for ICT, in particular super computers and PC servers (including Fujitsu's products) consume a large amount of electricity. The pursuit of energy efficiency would greatly contribute to our market competitiveness, whereas there is a risk that we may lose our competitive edge over our competitors in the technological development competition. Therefore, we always include this in the risk assessment. For example, one of the technological development projects Fujitsu is now focused upon is quantum computing. In 2020, Fujitsu started research and development on quantum computing in all areas from hardware to software, and spanning from basic to applied, through open innovation with leading research institutions across the globe (RIKEN, the University of Tokyo, Quantum Benchmark, etc.), and is actively making upfront investments. However, there is a concern in case if we cannot have supremacy in the technological development competition, our share or profitability may decrease. Under the company-wide risk management structure, each technology development unit and marketing department, which are responsible for such technological risks, play an active role in analyzing, evaluating, and managing risks in detail including the trends of other companies. On the other hand, for information gathering regarding cutting-edge environmental technologies, the Environmental division plays an active role in collecting information on the trends of other companies via industrial groups such as JEITA (Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association).  Furthermore, the 11th Fujitsu Group Environmental Action Plan (FY2023-FY2025) aims to resolve environmental and social issues by setting eight targets in three global risks areas highlighted by the World Economic Forum: “Climate Change,” “Resource Circulation,” and “Living in Harmony with Nature.” These targets are mapped against the two values of “Customers and Society” and “Fujitsu and the Supply Chain. In the area of Climate Change, we have set reduction targets for FY2025 to achieve Net Zero emissions of greenhouse gases from our business activities and from the entire value chain. We will achieve them through the strategic introduction of renewable energy and the development of energy conservation through advanced ICT. At the same time, we will promote efforts to grasp and reduce the environmental impact of our suppliers and achieve further energy savings by our products. Legal Relevant, sometimes included If the disclosure of climate change-related risks in business is insufficient, there is a non-zero chance that our shareholders and stakeholders file a lawsuit against us; therefore, it is included in the risk assessment appropriately. After COP 21 in 2015, investment to Fujitsu Group by investors making passive investment in consideration of ESG is increasing. In fact, there was a lawsuit in 2016 in which shareholders sued an Australian bank for neglecting to appropriately disclose climate change-related business risks. As our shareholders individually inquire on matters pertaining to climate change, we recognize that investors perceive this as a risk. A number of overseas ESG investors has acquired Fujitsu's stocks, and the holding rate has increased by about 15% since the adoption of the Paris Agreement. These investors tend to place importance on disclosure of information related to climate change. Appropriate information disclosure is becoming increasingly important, including assessment of risks related to climate change in business and results of current activities for measures against global warming. We strives to provide information to all stakeholders by holding ESG briefing sessions every year since FY 2015 and by disclosing information through our websites, CDP responses, etc. Under the company-wide risk management structure, we grasp the interests of stakeholders and confirm the possibility of emergence of lawsuit risk, led by environmental department , IR/PR office and legal department as organizations responsible for lawsuit risk. The risk of lawsuit against our company is assessed when the results of trend survey were reported from external organizations and a climate-related lawsuit was filed against other companies. Market Relevant, always included The market is expected to become more sensitive to the energy consumption levels of products and services and to the amount of energy savings achieved from solutions, following the increasing demand for GHG reductions to companies and risks of cost increases through the introduction of carbon taxes. Demands for low-carbon supercomputers and HPC (high-performing computing) have been increasing for the past few years as those are used as platforms for big data analysis and artificial intelligence. The reason energy-saving supercomputers are increasing in demand is the massive utility costs required in running supercomputers. Consequently, supercomputers with poor power efficiency will not be chosen by customers due to the high operational costs required and lead to business opportunity losses. As a result of collecting information on customer requests on improving energy efficiency, it has been determined that expanding demand for such low-carbon products is a potential business risk and has since always been included in risk assessments. For example, the annual power consumption of the supercomputer previously delivered by Fujitsu was equivalent to that of about 30,000 general households. When electricity rates rose, the impact was so great that a simple calculation indicated an increase in operating expenses of more than 200 million yen annually. The Company has since announced a successor model with significantly improved power performance, but a lack of continuous improvement in energy-saving performance would pose risks of missing business opportunities. As this risk is especially relevant to Fujitsu's system platform area, which accounts for 617 billion yen of sales in FY2022; in order to respond to the market's increase in demand, the Fujitsu Group is focusing on the development of next-generation HPC-related technology, including CPUs with lower power consumption and circuit technology development. We will also lose business opportunities if the amount of energy consumption reduced from our solutions is low against competitors. Therefore, we will increase business opportunities by maximizing energy efficiency through leveraging our AI-powered Zinrai solution and Digital Annealer that uses digital circuits inspired by quantum phenomena for high-speed solutions for optimization problems. Reputation Relevant, always included If the Fujitsu Group ranks low in rating related to climate-related measures, or if we becomes the target of NGO's negative campaign or boycott campaign, our brand image will be damaged, which may result in a risk of causing long-term negative impact on business, such as decrease in social credibility, increased cost to respond to the situation, and decreased loyalty of employees. Therefore, reputation risk is always included in the risk assessment. For example, together with eight other ICT companies, Fujitsu Finland was a subject of the survey called ''How Green Is My Interest?'', which is a company assessment carried out by an international NGO in 2013, and the benchmark report on energy use was published. While Fujitsu Finland was acknowledged as advanced due to the high energy efficiency of the data center, the limited use of renewable energy was revealed (the second lowest in rank). This NGO is influential in Finland and the NWE and CEE regions (Europe) where our sales account for 72% of our total overseas sales. Therefore, we accelerated the use of renewable energy in Fujitsu Finland, in order to avoid a risk that this NGO may denounce us. Detailed analysis, assessment, and management of such reputation risks are performed under the company-wide risk management structure, led by PR office and environmental department as organizations responsible for the risk. We monitor NGO's proposals, lobbying activities, and survey reports and check the possibility of risks. Acute physical Relevant, always included Due to occurrences of acute natural disasters such as large-scale flood damage, sudden downpours, and lightning, business sites and data centers of the Fujitsu Group may suffer from floods and severed energy supply. We include acute physical risks in the risk assessment as we recognize the possibilities of business impact such as failures of electric devices and power-supply facilities, loss of important data, production line stops, and leakage of toxic substances. For example, there was a case that almost led to service suspension after sudden heavy rain exceeded the area's water treatment capacity within a short time period and flooded into a Fujitsu Group company's office. Since Fujitsu's data centers bear the responsibilities for system operations of customers as the platforms for providing outsourcing services, operation suspension by natural disasters must be prevented. At the primary data centers in Gunma Prefecture, Hyogo Prefectures, etc., we have raised the floor level of the buildings higher than ground level, improved drainage design to prevent puddles on the roof, and carried out periodical waterproofing work, in order to avoid flood risks in case disasters should occur. We make efforts for our business continuity and achieve stable operation of customers' systems. As for such acute physical risks in Fujitsu business sites, the general affairs department, facility management department, and data center operation department play an active role in risk assessments. Based on the data center facility standards (Tier), which are external certified standards, and our in-house facility management standards, internal audits from the quality control department carries out on-site audits and risk assessment in each phase of planning, designing, construction, and operation of buildings. This allows the entire group to ensure the prevention of physical risks due to acute natural disasters and maintain our business continuity. In FY2020, Fujitsu assessed the risk of flooding at its locations, including those of group companies. As a result, it installed waterproof banks for the main building of Fujitsu's Kawasaki Plant, an important hub for the Company's internal network, and throughout Fujitsu Solution Square. Chronic physical Relevant, always included Rising average temperatures due to climate change cause air conditioning energy of data centers, plants and offices, alongside energy costs in general, to increase. For example, our data center has seen about a 3% increase in energy usage per every 1°C increase in the average annual outside temperature. In addition, there will be consequences in the event IT equipment in our data center cannot be sufficiently cooled, such as reduced arithmetic processing capacity and shortened equipment life. To fully utilize energy conservation and renewable energy, the new building at our data center in Gunma prefecture makes use of high-efficiency UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply), free cooling and green energy such as solar power. Feasible energy conservation initiatives have also been reviewed and implemented in other locations as well. With regard to energy consumption and costs associated with business activities, the divisions responsible for facilities, the environment and purchasing play a central role in determining risks through assessments and predictions of power cost increases by collecting data on energy consumption from each facility. When planning and repairing sites, the purchasing department compares and analyzes power rates through utilizing the company's procured power system in considering cost optimization with the contracted power company and cutting down CO2 emissions while also planning energy-saving designs. Environmental department performs correlation analysis of temperature and electricity consumption, estimates energy consumption of the day based on the weather forecast on the previous day, and provides information through a portal website accessible by each site.

Identifier Risk 1 Where in the value chain does the risk driver occur? Direct operations Risk type & Primary climate-related risk driver Emerging regulation Carbon pricing mechanisms Primary potential financial impact Increased indirect (operating) costs Climate risk type mapped to traditional financial services industry risk classification <Not Applicable> Company-specific description Carbon taxes are being introduced in Europe, the United States, China, Australia, and various other countries where Fujitsu has business bases. In Japan, too, discussions are underway on a proposed system to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, and the government has decided to introduce a Japanese version of carbon pricing in stages beginning in FY2023. If a carbon tax is introduced, the risk of future cost increases could arise. Such increases could be seen in capital investment expenditure for energy conservation (1.5 billion yen in FY2021), energy procurement costs, credit procurement costs, and procurement costs for renewable energy electricity and certificates. For example, according to the the IEA Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP) 2DS Scenario, carbon taxes may begin in the U.S. at $35/t-CO2 in 2020 and it could increase linearly to $210/t-CO2 by 2050. (At present, the US has not introduced a carbon tax at a national level. The current administration, however, has pledged to introduce carbon border adjustment measures, and discussions on implementing a carbon tax may suddenly emerge going forward.) As there are business sites of Fujitsu America and Fujitsu Network Communications (FNC), the power consumption in the country accounts for 8.5% of Fujitsu Group's total power consumption of all overseas sites. If Fujitsu's US locations do not continually use power derived from renewable energy sources, The cost of the carbon tax could have a financial impact ranging from 30 million yen to as high as 210 million yen. The Japanese government (Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and Ministry of the Environment (MOE)) is currently discussing the introduction of carbon pricing to achieve zero carbon emissions by 2050, which could pose risks of increased costs going forward. Regarding the carbon pricing policy, in countries with an emissions trading system, as distinct from carbon taxes, a financial impact occurs only when there is an excess of emissions. Therefore, we consider the impact is limited. A simple simulation of the Scope 1 & 2 emissions (497490 t-CO2) of the entire Fujitsu Group, it is equivalent to a financial impact of 1.3 billion to 9.1 billion yen (Calculated as 131 yen to the dollar). Time horizon Medium-term Likelihood Likely Magnitude of impact Medium Are you able to provide a potential financial impact figure? Yes, an estimated range Potential financial impact figure (currency) <Not Applicable> Potential financial impact figure – minimum (currency) 1303423800 Potential financial impact figure – maximum (currency) 13685949900 Explanation of financial impact figure Regulatory compliance cost regarding electricity procurement is included in operating costs. If we do not shift to renewable energy, we will be obliged to pay carbon taxes, which will lead to an increase in operating costs. According to the 450 scenario of the IEA World Energy Outlook(2020), carbon taxes may be introduced to the U.S. at $20/t-CO2, and it is expected to be raised to $140/t- CO2 by 2040. To simply simulate by applying this tax rate to Scope 1 & 2 emissions (497490 t-CO2) of the entire Fujitsu Group, it is equivalent to a financial impact of 1.3 billion to 9.1 billion yen (Calculated as 131 yen to the dollar). We also take it into consideration of the worst-case scenario. According to the IEA Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP) 2DS Scenario, there is a report that carbon taxes in the U.S. will rise up to $210/t-CO2 by 2050, it is equivalent to a financial impact of 14.7 billion yen. Cost of response to risk 1500000000 Description of response and explanation of cost calculation To minimize the regulatory risks, we simultaneously promotes (1) progressive expansion of renewable energy(RE) use and (2) thorough energy conservation. (1) As we pursue to expand the use of RE, we joined 'RE100 Initiative' in 2018 with a goal of 40% by 2030 and 100% by 2050.  For example, since June 2022, Fujitsu Australia has been using renewable energy to cover approximately 40% of the electricity it uses at its data centers. This is equivalent to about 30% of Fujitsu Australia’s total annual electric power consumption and will offset approximately 30,000 tons of Fujitsu Australia’s annual greenhouse gas emissions. Fujitsu Australia’s effort is an important step toward decarbonizing its operations and providing low-GHG-emitting services to its customers. This initiative will lead to a reduction in the amount of carbon tax paid, as well. (2) Each business group set and manage energy reduction target based on Fujitsu's Science Based Target updated in 2020. We promote a reduction in emissions through the evaluation of priority projects, based on the Facility Investment Guidelines which set criteria for investment from economical and environmental perspectives. For example,In 2020, Fujitsu Frontech Ltd. has introduced SOFC to its Kumagaya Service Solution Center(SSC) . In light of introducing this fuel cell power generation system, approximately 50% of the electricity consumed at the Kumagaya SSC can be supplied by the fuel cells and reduce annual CO2 emissions by approximately 35% (compared to FY 2018) compared to when all power needed is procured from its power company. With our promotion of the use of renewable energy and energy-saving facilities, etc., in response to the increased introduction of carbon pricing in various countries, we were able to avoid costs of 85 million yen for renewable energy and 940 million yen for energy-saving facilities, respectively. 'The 'Cost of response to risk' was calculated by totaling the capital investment budget for global warming countermeasures in FY2021 (1.5 billion yen/year).The breakdown is mostly investment for energy conservation, with about 80% for new introduction of air conditioners and refrigerators, and about 20% for LED lighting. Comment CDP Page  of 125 7  ===== PAGE 8 ===== Identifier Risk 2 Where in the value chain does the risk driver occur? Direct operations Risk type & Primary climate-related risk driver Market Other, please specify (Changes in electricity prices due to decarbonization) Primary potential financial impact Increased indirect (operating) costs Climate risk type mapped to traditional financial services industry risk classification <Not Applicable> Company-specific description In the Fujitsu Group, the energy use in the operation of data centers and production in plants accounts for 80 to 90 percent of the total energy use in the group. As energy use is essential in business activities, we consider an increase in expenditure associated with the fluctuation of electricity prices as a risk, and take it seriously. In particular, we are concerned about ’decarbonization surcharges’ as a transition risk. In Japan where Fujitsu's data centers are located, for example, there is a Feed-in Tariff (FIT) scheme for renewable energy. The surcharge unit price, According to the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy,It is estimated the amount will reach 4.7 trillion yen in 2030. The unit price of the surcharge, which was 3.45 yen/kWh in FY2022, is expected to rise by about 10% with the increase in renewable energy.  If FIT surcharge rises in the future, it will lead to an increase in our expenditure, and our cost competitiveness of data center-related services such as out-sourcing for instance, will decline. We anticipate possibilities that the similar low-carbon obligation schemes in other countries, either an emerging or strengthened regulation, may impact other Fujitsu sites as well, as maximum potential impact of a surcharge equivalent to 4.1 billion yen is estimated. Time horizon Short-term Likelihood Likely Magnitude of impact Medium-low Are you able to provide a potential financial impact figure? Yes, a single figure estimate Potential financial impact figure (currency) 4100000000 Potential financial impact figure – minimum (currency) <Not Applicable> Potential financial impact figure – maximum (currency) <Not Applicable> Explanation of financial impact figure Currently, FIT surcharge has brought a financial impact to Fujitsu sites in Japan. Considering that the similar scheme will also bring a financial impact to our sites in other countries in the future, based on the in-house estimation of FIT surcharge in Japan as of 2030 (1.1 times of the current surcharge unit price 3.45 yen/kWh) on the purchased electricity volume of the Fujitsu Group worldwide (it was 1,058,560MWh in FY2022), an impact of about 4.1 billion yen is expected. Cost of response to risk 120000000 Description of response and explanation of cost calculation The Fujitsu Group must lower its electric power consumption to mitigate the financial impact of charges associated with the FIT surcharge system. We evaluate priority projects based on our Capital Investment Guidelines, which set internal standards for capital investment from economic and environmental perspectives. We then apply best-practice measures to develop innovative technologies and internal practices. For example, we introduced into some data centers in the Kanto and Hokuriku regions an air-conditioning control system that utilizes Fujitsu-developed AI (machine learning). This system minimizes the power needed to cool high-performance, high-heat-generating servers and other IT equipment to address their increasing power consumption (heat generation). This step has reduced annual power consumption by over 20%(FY 2019 and beyond). We are likewise implementing energy-saving measures for air conditioners at data centers of other business sites by frequently reassessing the cooling temperature and flow rate of chilled water. Such measures include extending the operating hours of outdoor air cooling and using free cooling. By deploying these measures across our organization, we are endeavoring to minimize the risk that FIT surcharges will affect our financial circumstances. The ''Cost of response to risk'' was calculated by aggregating R&D costs for promoting energy conservation, such as power reduction technologies in FY2020 (costs for developing technology to reduce power consumption of servers by accelerating processing speed, etc.). (120 million yen/year). The breakdown is about 50% for the development of energy conservation technologies for data centers and about 50% for the development of manufacturing processes and other related technologies. At Fujitsu, we plan to invest 1 to 2 billion yen annually over the short to medium term in energy-saving equipment and other decarbonization measures. We will also reduce power costs by installing energy-saving equipment. Comment Identifier Risk 3 Where in the value chain does the risk driver occur? Direct operations Risk type & Primary climate-related risk driver Reputation Increased stakeholder concern or negative stakeholder feedback CDP Page  of 125 8  ===== PAGE 9 ===== Primary potential financial impact Decreased revenues due to reduced demand for products and services Climate risk type mapped to traditional financial services industry risk classification <Not Applicable> Company-specific description If the Fujitsu Group is ranked low regarding countermeasures against climate change or if the group becomes the target of NGO's negative campaigns or boycott, our brand value will be weakened, and there are risks of a long-term negative impact on our business such as a loss of social credibility, an increase in cost for measures, and a decrease in employees' loyalty.In fact, in recent years, investors and business partners have been demanding more proactive disclosure of climate change measures, and contractual terms and conditions require climate change measures such as greenhouse gas emission reductions, so we recognize that a company-wide approach is essential. According to the RE100 2022 annual disclosure report, the “Services” sector, to which Fujitsu belongs, had a 60% renewable energy utilization rate in 2021, and the average target year for achieving RE100 is 2027, which is ahead of other industries. The sector is facing intensified competition and higher sector-specific risks. For example, together with eight other ICT companies, Fujitsu Finland was a subject of the survey called ''How Green Is My Interest?'', which is an company assessment carried out by an international NGO in 2013, and the benchmark report on energy use including our company's information was published. While Fujitsu Finland was acknowledged as advanced due to the high energy efficiency of the data center, the limited use of renewable energy was revealed by the report (the second lowest in rank). This NGO is influential in Finland and the NWE and CEE region (Europe) where our sales account for 72% of our total overseas sales. Time horizon Short-term Likelihood Very likely Magnitude of impact Medium-low Are you able to provide a potential financial impact figure? Yes, a single figure estimate Potential financial impact figure (currency) 26300000000 Potential financial impact figure – minimum (currency) <Not Applicable> Potential financial impact figure – maximum (currency) <Not Applicable> Explanation of financial impact figure If by any chance the situations get aggravated as to cause product recalls, it will have a significant financial impact. By studying other companies' cases, we estimate that there was a 7 to 15% decrease of revenue due to the impact of extraordinary loss and cost for countermeasures. However, in many cases, behind these worst situations, there are faults on a company's side, including false description of product information. Thus, even if our company becomes the target of negative campaigns or boycott, it is predicted that the impact on sales will remain small, as long as there is no significant negligence made by our company. To estimate the potential financial impact on overseas sites' sales of 1316.9 billion yen, where NGO's influences are relatively strong, the financial impact will be around 26.3 billion yen if an impact of 1% occurs for two years. Cost of response to risk 200000000 Description of response and explanation of cost calculation To avoid reputation risks, Fujitsu gathers information on major environment-related rating surveys, as well as performance data pertaining to climate change at each of its sites, in an effort to be up-to-date. As a result, recognizing the importance of introducing renewable energy(RE), Fujitsu joined the Science Based Target Initiative and the RE100 Initiative, in order to expand our use of RE following the internationally common framework; and we have set targets of 40% of RE use by 2030 and 100% by 2050. In line with this goal, Fujitsu is also working to expand the use of RE primarily in its data centers outside Japan. To that end, Fujitsu is surveying the cost of introducing RE to this end.  For example, in Fujitsu Finland, a benchmark report in comparison with other eight ICT companies was published. While Fujitsu Finland was acknowledged as advanced due to the high energy efficiency of the data center, the limited use of RE was revealed and ranked the second lowest. In addition, considering surging carbon taxes in Finland, a decision was made to shift the power source to RE at the Management Board of Fujitsu Finland. As a result, since 2014, Fujitsu Finland have been purchasing certified, 100% RE (wind power) in its facilities including offices and data centers, in spite of the fact that they are rental facilities.  Furthermore, based on case studies in Finland, we believe that the rate of RE use can be a reputational risk for customers in providing data center services globally, and we are developing carbon neutral data center service offerings, mainly for data center operations with typically high emissions, both in Japan and abroad. Specifically, we completed a switch to 100% RE for all power required to operate the FUJITSU Hybrid IT Service FJcloud, a cloud service provided by Fujitsu data centers in Japan, by FY2022. The 'Cost of response to risk' is calculated as internal costs for responding to ESG-related information disclosure in order to mitigate and avoid risks of reputation damage. (The costs of major environmental rating surveys and data monitoring at each site are calculated by multiplying the personnel costs per person of 20 million yen per year by the number of employees 10 corresponding to the risk (200 million yen).)Of this amount, about 10% was for environment-related rating surveys and the remaining about 90% was for data monitoring at each site.

However, driver shortages and traffic congestion accompanying growing logistics volume, increasing CO2 emissions, and other concerns have become important issues. Thus, reducing CO2 in the logistics sector, which accounts for more than one-third of CO2 emissions in the transportation sector, is an urgent and extremely important challenge that must be overcome to achieve the greenhouse gas reduction target (35% reduction in the transportation sector) set in the Plan for Global Warming Countermeasures. As a service provider, Fujitsu provides logistics solutions and other systems and services ranging from supply chain management strategy planning to development and operation. We aim to contribute to environmental and social issues such as the reduction of CO2 emissions through our business by solving logistics efficiency issues with our technologies. To meet such customer needs, Fujitsu's quantum computing technology Digital Annealer, a new architecture that rapidly solves ''combinatorial optimization problems'' using a digital circuit design inspired by quantum phenomena, can be applied. By utilizing Digital Annealer, we were able to reduce CO2 emissions by 8.9%, not only by reducing calculation time, but also by discovering effective distribution routes, improving loading efficiency, and improving the efficiency of the number of trucks and total mileage driven. We also confirmed a 2 ~ 5% reduction in distribution costs, including the number of drivers, number of trucks, mileage, and sorting work. This technology thus possesses an overwhelming advantage over conventional methods.

Yes, a single figure estimate Potential financial impact figure (currency) 4192000000000 Potential financial impact figure – minimum (currency) <Not Applicable> Potential financial impact figure – maximum (currency) <Not Applicable> Explanation of financial impact figure According to the GeSI (Global e-Sustainability Initiative) report (Based on a detailed model that quantifies the broad social and economic benefits of ICT, it reports on ICT ’ s contribution to reducing global CO2 emissions and realizing a sustainable society), new sales that the ICT sector will generate in regards to global warming countermeasures are estimated to be about 2 trillion dollars as of 2030 based. If we apply our IT service share of 1.6% in the world in FY2020 (source: IDC Japan), we can estimate that Fujitsu will have new market opportunities of about 4.2 trillion yen (Calculated as 131 yen to the dollar). Among them, logistics market opportunities are assumed to be around 4,192 billions of yen, which is about 1/10 of the market opportunity. Cost to realize opportunity 18900000000 Strategy to realize opportunity and explanation of cost calculation Fujitsu is endeavoring to generate opportunities in the logistics industry in relation to reducing their fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. As a result, in 2020, for example, Fujitsu and Toyota Systems Corporation jointly conducted a demonstration using Digital Annealer to optimize the distribution network for parts required for automobile manufacturing. To solve the problem of searching for more than 3 million routes to purchase parts from more than several hundred suppliers, pass through relay warehouses, and deliver them to factories, Digital Annealer was used to calculate and optimize logistics costs, including fleet size, total distance traveled, and sorting operations. As a result, it was confirmed that a massive number of optimization calculations could be performed in a very short time span. Furthermore, the demonstration indicated this technology can potentially reduce logistics-related costs by approximately 2% to 5% by discovering effective logistics routes that could previously not be found, thereby improving loading efficiency and increasing fleet efficiency and total distance traveled.  As such, this technology possesses an overwhelming advantage over conventional methods and provides an opportunity to capture the market. We began making Fujitsu Computing as a Service (CaaS)—which includes the Digital Annealer adopted here as a component technology—available in Japan from October 2022 and will be gradually expanding globally in FY2023. CaaS is a set of services that makes advanced computing and software technologies easily accessible to everyone. The 'Cost to realize opportunity' is calculated as R&D costs on services pertaining to climate change (calculated by multiplying the Fujitsu Group's R&D costs in FY2022 (109.5 billion yen) by the ratio of low-carbon services (17.2%): 18.9 billion yen/year). These include solution services and infrastructure services such as cloud.By 2030, we aim to increase sales by offering environmental impact reduction-related components as added value when discussing measures to address issues in various industries with customers. Under our Fujitsu Uvance brand, which envisions society in 2030, we aim to increase sales by providing added value from the perspective of reducing environmental impact when discussing measures to address issues in various industries with our customers, and contribute to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 on a global scale.

Downstream CDP Page   of 125 10  ===== PAGE 11 ===== Opportunity type Products and services Primary climate-related opportunity driver Development and/or expansion of low emission goods and services Primary potential financial impact Increased revenues resulting from increased demand for products and services Company-specific description Fujitsu recognizes that there is a large demand for energy-saving products in the global market. In recent years, in the public sector, there has been a higher demand for a server called HPC (High Performing Computing) and supercompeter as a basis of big data and AI. At present, the cost of cooling energy for data centers is extremely high due to the high heat generation of HPCs, and there is thus strong demand for energy-saving products. To meet the growing market demand for energy-saving products, the Fujitsu Group is focusing on the development of supercomputer-related technologies such as CPUs with low power consumption per performance, and circuit technology.  For example, the annual power consumption of the supercomputer previously delivered by Fujitsu was equivalent to that of about 30,000 general households. When electricity rates rose, the impact was so great that a simple calculation indicated an increase in operating expenses of more than 200 million yen annually. In light of this, the Company has strengthened its development of system implementation technology to achieve high performance and energy conservation. The prototype supercomputer equipped with this technology has ranked #1 in the Green500 supercomputer energy efficiency ranking in 2019. This system implementation technology reduces CPU power consumption in addition to mitigating power loss across the entire system by applying measures such as reduced power loss from the power-supply unit through the use of Fujitsu's proprietary circuit method and latest high-efficiency circuits. As a result, the overall power loss across the entire system has fallen significantly from 24% to 14%, achieving one of the world's highest power-efficiency performances. This unique energy-saving technology possesses market advantage over competitors. As for Fujitsu's business segment, it is considered that the system platform category (servers, storage systems, network products, etc.), which contributes to sales of 678.1 billion yen, will enjoy the benefits of this business opportunity.

According to the survey conducted by a U.S. research company, Hyperion Research,The HPC cloud market is expected to grow from 6.3 billion USD in 2022 to nearly 11.5 billion USD by 2026. The 5-year CAGR from 2021 to 2026 is 17.6%. If we assume that the Fujitsu's system platform area, which accounts for 678.1 billion yen of sales in FY2022, will grow to 17.6% by 2026, we can expect an increase in sales by about 618.8 billion yen. Cost to realize opportunity 18900000000 Strategy to realize opportunity and explanation of cost calculation While the demand for servers including HPC (High-Performing Computing) and supercomputers is on the rise as foundations for big data and AI, further improvements in energy-saving performance is anticipated given that they consume significant amounts of power. In order to obtain business opportunities through energy-saving products, since FY2013, Fujitsu has been promoting product development focusing on ''energy efficiency'' when products are used, which has a significant impact on the product life cycle. To achieve SBT, the Environmental Action Plan Stage X from FY2021 states that the Fujitsu Group will ''Reduce CO2 emissions due to power consumption during product usage in FY2021 by at least 37% (compared to FY2013)'' and the Group continues to develop energy-saving products by setting energy efficiency and power consumption during use as indicators. As a result, for example, the PRIMEHPC FX1000 supercomputer, which has achieved one of the world's best power consumption performances, was developed and offered to the market by thoroughly reducing the power loss of the entire system through applying Fujitsu's proprietary circuit method and latest high-efficiency circuits.This supercomputer system was installed in Canon Inc. in 2020 for use in simulations in Canon’s product development processes. By reducing unnecessary product prototype developments, benefits including shortened product development phases, cost reductions, and product performance, quality and functionality improvements are anticipated through advanced energy-saving performance.  This proprietary energy-saving technology possesses market advantages over competitors and thus implies opportunities for capturing the market. The 'Cost to realize opportunity' is calculated as R&D costs on products pertaining to climate change (calculated by multiplying the Fujitsu Group's R&D costs in FY2022 (109.5 billion yen) by the ratio of low-carbon products (17.2%): 18.9 billion yen/year). Approximately 63% account for system products, and approximately 37% account for network products. Also, Fujitsu plans to invest 700 billion yen in business growth over the three years of its mid-term plan (2023-2025). Our technology strategy is one of the major areas of investment for business growth; in the “computing field,” we will develop computing technology with high performance, high scalability, high reliability, and low power consumption.

When a disaster occurs, municipalities play a critical role in communicating evacuation advisories to residents. And one of the biggest challenges they face is the timing of it. Simulation technology for predicting weather conditions and the scale of disasters is an effective way to solve this problem. The use of ICT in disaster prevention and mitigation is in great demand among local governments and above, and the research and development on weather-forecasting and disaster-prediction technologies, together with the provision of related services, will generate business opportunities for Fujitsu.  An example is our construction of a supercomputer that forecasts the occurrence of linear precipitation zones, a cause of torrential rain-related disasters such as landslides and river flooding, for the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) in 2023. Applying our high-performance and high-reliability PRIMEHPC FX1000, we are working to help realize a safe, secure, and resilient society by supporting the JMA in its efforts to provide prompt, more accurate linear precipitation zone predictions and by contributing to disaster prevention and mitigation by tying those predictions to torrential rain preparations and early evacuation. In 2020, Fujitsu also started providing an artificial intelligence (AI) water-management forecasting system that predicts river water levels during floods. This system utilizes Fujitsu's AI-based proprietary technology that enables real-time, highly accurate prediction of river levels every 10 minutes for up to six hours in advance during floods, even for small and medium-sized rivers with limited water level data available. This system will help local governments to make appropriate decisions regarding disaster prevention and mitigation, including executing rapid on-site response and issuing evacuation advisories. The Japanese government's budget for disaster prevention and mitigation is approximately 4.7 trillion yen (FY2023 budget plan), and the IT infrastructure-related budget can be estimated at approximately 10%, or 470 billion yen, based on a breakdown of budget items. Given that demand for IT services for disaster prevention and mitigation is high in other countries as well, business opportunities worth approximately 24.8 billion yen are anticipated when taking into account Fujitsu's share of the IT services market.

Systematic city planning and efficient devising of disaster response plans based on simulations of natural disasters are pivotal in preparing for disasters caused by climate change. Fujitsu's AI technology is extremely helpful in running such simulations needed in adapting to climate change. In 2020, we developed an AI-based water management forecasting system that uses machine learning to predict river water levels based on past rainfall and water level data. The system can predict water levels at ten-minute intervals for up to six hours ahead by importing forecasted rainfall amounts. This capability will be useful to local governments when preparing on-site response plans, issuing evacuation orders, or making other disaster prevention and mitigation decisions. The system has been delivered to several municipalities who are now verifying consistency between actual and predicted values and studying practical applications. In addition, more and more companies are adopting our Digital Resilience Service, which we launched in 2021 to support disaster response and business continuity. In this way, we are creating new use cases, such as applications in crisis management as part of in-house general affairs and routine operations in the construction industry. Additionally, Fujitsu intends to provide value to society under the “Trusted Society” concept to realize a prosperous, safe, secure, sustainable, and livable city by backcasting from the vision of the world in 2030 as it should be. The 'Cost to realize opportunity' is calculated as R&D costs on services pertaining to climate change (calculated by multiplying the Fujitsu Group's R&D costs in FY2022 (109.5 billion yen) by the ratio of low-carbon products (17.2%): 18.9 billion yen/year). These include solution services and infrastructure services such as cloud. Also, Fujitsu plans to invest 700 billion yen in business growth over the three years of its mid-term plan (2023-2025). Our technology strategy is one of the major areas of investment for business growth; in the “AI field” and the “converging technologies field,” we are developing technologies to accelerate social implementation of technology in a wide range of fields, such as disaster prevention.

In addition, identify the direction of business strategies in the business focus areas in each scenario. Results of the climate-related scenario analysis with respect to the focal questions First half of 2021, We conducted our scenario analysis in four steps: “risk materiality assessment,” “scenario definition,” “business impact assessment,” and “a study of We conducted our scenario analysis in four steps: “risk materiality assessment,” “scenario definition,” “business impact assessment,” and “a study of countermeasures.” Focusing on the example of the automotive IT solutions business in the 1.5°C scenario, we estimated that global carbon pricing, emission targets, and policies would accelerate the trend toward tighter regulation of internal combustion engines and carbon neutrality throughout the product life cycle in the automotive industry, an industry which is a major source of business for us. We identified a growing need to visualize CO2 emissions throughout the supply chain, to develop strategies to become carbon neutral, and to support measures using digital technology to reduce environmental impact throughout product lifecycles as a whole, stimulated by demand for enhanced CO2 traceability using digital technology such as blockchain in the supply chains of our client industries. This is an opportunity for us to increase our IT solutions sales. Based on the results of the scenario analysis, In addition, in our Sustainability Manufacturing Department (which deals with IT solutions for manufacturing clients), which one of Fujitsu's priority business areas. From the second half of 2021, we has established “Carbon Neutrality” as a theme for providing value, and have already started offering services such as CO2 emissions visualization and strategic support for achieving carbon neutrality. We judged that our business demonstrated resilience from medium- and long-term perspectives. We reached this conclusion based on the consistency of the business strategy in the Fujitsu Group (orientation of the offering menu for each priority business area) and climate change strategy (SBT 1.5°C) and development of company-wide promotion of the above stated risk countermeasures. C3.3 CDP Page   of 125 14  ===== PAGE 15 ===== (C3.3) Describe where and how climate-related risks and opportunities have influenced your strategy. Have climate- related risks and opportunities influenced your strategy in this area? Description of influence Products and services Yes Increased sales opportunities for ICT products and solutions services that can contribute to climate change ''mitigation'' affect revenue. At the moment, climate change-related solutions, products and services account for 29% of sales. We expect the proportion to further increase, thereby affecting our short and medium-term strategies. Specifically, Fujitsu reflected in its strategy the promotion of development of energy-saving technologies for its products. By providing energy-saving products and services, we can contribute to reducing cusutomer's power usage. This is also in line with the customer demands to reduce CO2 emissions and leads to enhanced competitiveness of our products and services as well as market superiority. Demands for HPC (High Performing Computing) servers as foundations for big data analysis and AI are increasing in recent years. As server performance evolves, power consumption and heat generation increase, and the power consumption of ancillary facilities such as air conditioners for cooling the server likewise increases. As such, power consumption pertaining to servers and air conditioning for cooling are becoming major issues for customers and society. Fujitsu views the reduction of CO2 emissions during customer use through increasing focus on energy-saving product development as a business opportunity.  In particular, Fujitsu is strengthening product development focusing on a system implementation technology, to reduce power consumption in HPC for big data analysis and AI. This technology reduces CPU power consumption in addition to mitigating power loss across the entire system with measures including the reduction of power loss of the power supply unit through the use of Fujitsu's proprietary circuit method and the latest high-efficiency circuits. As a result, the overall power loss has been significantly reduced from 24% to 14%, achieving one of the world's highest power efficiency performances. Fujitsu has been offering products incorporating this technology since 2020. This unique energy-saving technology has a market advantage our over competitors. Since the provision of such energy-saving products leads to a reduction in CO2 emissions during use by customers, Fujitsu aims to reduce CO2 emissions during use by 12.5% (Compared to FY2020) by FY2030, and develop and provide advanced energy-saving products to customers. Supply chain and/or value chain Yes An increase in natural disasters, alongside other physical risks, impact the company, such as making our procurement of parts difficult. Furthermore, when it comes to procurement items, regulatory risks have an impact on the business, such as through price increases of the procurement items regulatory risks. These factors consequently affected Fujitsu's short and medium-term business strategies, including strengthening risk management for the supply chain. For example, we recognize that physical risks, such as floods extraordinary in scale, will particularly affect our business partners in Southeast Asia. In 2011 when significant flooding hit Thailand, our procurement of parts was delayed due to the shutdown of supplier plants and distribution networks were disrupted, resulting in a decrease of sales by 28 billion yen. We immediately surveyed approximately 80 of our business partners in Thailand, which manufacture storage, semiconductors, power supplies and other products, on damages, their progress toward recovery and their impacts on our company. Although we were able to minimize the impact by ordering from other suppliers as necessary among other measures, the events changed our strategies on suppliers, including our strengthening of our BCM (business continuity management) strategy. Specifically, we added monitoring of BCM activities through surveys, analysis of survey responses, and support for BCM enhancement through feedback of analysis results to suppliers to the strategy. In addition, Fujitsu has been using the standardized forms by the JEITA (Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association) Materials Committee since its FY2014 survey. For business partners that were determined to be particularly possessing risks through the survey, we reduce risks on our company by minimizing impact on our business through activities such as multi-sourcing. Fujitsu has incorporated a strategy to maintain and continue these activities and reduce risks. Investment in R&D Yes Increased opportunities to provide ICT products and solutions services that contribute to ''mitigation'' and ''adaptation'' of climate change impact revenue. At the moment, climate change-related solutions, products and services account for 29% of sales. While the impact is already significant, we expect the proportion to further increase, thereby affecting our short- and medium-term strategies and leading to the selection and concentration of investment areas in R&D. Fujitsu advocates the use of ICT to empower people and create value for business and society. All R&D activities for this concept generally contribute to climate change countermeasures and sustainability. In 2020, Fujitsu started research and development of quantum computing technology said to be capable of cutting down power consumption significantly, in all areas from hardware to software, and from basics to application, through open innovation with leading research institutions across the globe (RIKEN, the University of Tokyo, etc.). Under the 10th Fujitsu Group Environmental Action Plan, we strove to promote and expand customers’ and society’s use of renewable energy by expanding renewable energy use at our own business sites through virtual power purchase agreements (VPPA) and other initiatives, and by utilizing the Fujitsu Group’s own advanced ICT technologies, such as blockchain technology. In FY2021, we achieved success in energy-saving technology by raising delivery efficiency in logistics. We accomplished this by applying a unique Fujitsu quantum computing technology called “Digital Annealer,” a new architecture for solving “combinatorial optimization problems” at high speed using a digital circuit inspired by quantum phenomena. We also had successes in AI and other new technologies that can predict water levels along rivers for which past rainfall and water level data are scarce. These technologies can contribute to disaster prevention, which is one form of climate change adaptation.  We plan to invest 700 billion yen in business growth areas, including technology strategies, to create value for society and customers and transform Fujitsu into a DX company. Operations Yes Regulatory risks increase the costs of responding to regulatory changes. In order to minimize the impact of this, short-, medium- and long-term business strategies were changed, with the promotion of energy conservation activities in operations added. For example, Fujitsu Climate and Energy Vision, a medium- and long-term environmental vision designed toward 2017 and 2050, was established to promote energy conservation and decarbonization in long-term operations. The Vision was recognized as an SBT as a scientifically based GHG reduction target. In 2020, the Company upgraded to SBT 1.5°C certification. And received Net 0 certification in July 2023.In addition, Fujitsu joined RE100 in 2018 to accelerate the use of renewable energy. In the short to medium term, for example, various measures are being actively promoted to enable compliance with these laws and regulations in response to trends in regulations, including the Act on Rational Use and Proper Management of Fluorocarbons and the Act on the Rational Use of Energy. Specifically, Fujitsu is actively promoting activities to reduce CO2, such as strengthening environmental data management at each business site, introducing state-of-the-art low-carbon facilities and optimizing operations as energy conservation measures, improving the efficiency of manufacturing processes, and conserving electricity in lighting and OA equipment, as well as expanding the purchase and use of renewable energy. In Japan, as a regulatory risk, a levy was added to the cost of electricity under the feed-in tariff (FIT) for renewable energy. To this, Fujitsu is strengthening energy conservation measures. Through the energy-saving measures, CO2 emissions in FY2020 were reduced by approximately 2.5% from the previous year. The introduction of renewable energy also expanded by 22.2% compared to FY2017. Fujitsu has set a target of reducing CO2 emissions from its group companies by 71.4% (compared to FY2013 levels) by FY2030, and is promoting the abovementioned energy-saving measures and the introduction of renewable energy. Specifically, the Environmental Action Plan Stage X (FY2021-FY2022) has set goals of ''reducing GHG emissions from business sites by 15% or more, compared with the base year of FY2013'' and ''increasing renewable energy usage to 30% of total electricity in FY2022.'' C3.4 (C3.4) Describe where and how climate-related risks and opportunities have influenced your financial planning. Financial planning elements that have been influenced Description of influence Row 1 Capital expenditures Regulatory risks, such as compliance with the current Act on Rational Use and Proper Management of Fluorocarbons, coupled with the projected increase in carbon taxes, have impacted to Fujitsu's capital expenditures. In order to minimize the operation cost increase brought about by these regulations, capital investments to promote energy conservation were affected. For example, investments on global warming prevention such as energy-saving equipment and replacements to better air-conditioning efficiency totaled approximately 1.5 billion yen in2022.  In addition, expenses were incurred for regular building repairs and reinforcements to guard against potential damage to facility building and production equipment in the event of a large-scale torrential rain or the occurrence of tropical storms, which are physical risks associated with climate change. In terms of financial impact, these expenses constituted 10% or more of capital investment among Fujitsu’s capital expenditures. Because it addresses both climate change and aging of facilities, We plan to make capital investments of approximately 1 billion yen in FY2023. We intend to continue investing this amount over the short to medium term, and therefore our plans call for making investments of between 1 and 2 billion yen each year.

Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year This target is a revised version of the SBT 1.5 °C target, which was certified in 2021, as Near-term SBT based on the SBT net 0 standard, and SBTi certification was obtained. As a short-term objective for achieving SBT, the Fujitsu Group Environmental Action Plan (Stage X) for FY2021-2022 sets a goal of “[reducing] GHG emissions from business sites by 4.2% or more annually, compared with the base year (FY2013)” in line with the SBT1.5°C target. By promoting energy conservation and expanding the introduction of renewable energy, we posted actual results for FY2022 that were 17% lower than the previous year. We have therefore achieved this short-term objective .

Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year The target covers all electric power purchased within the Fujitsu Group. Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year We joined the RE100 initiative in July 2018. By 2030, the target was changed to 100% of electricity use derived from renewable energy. As an interim target, we aim to get at least 40% of the electric power we use from renewable energy sources by 2030. To achieve this goal, our Environmental Action Plan (Stage Ⅺ) (FY2022-2025) set a target renewable energy rate in FY2025 of 50% or more. Nevertheless, we achieved a 30% renewable energy rate in FY2022. We worked to increase the renewable energy usage rates of our factories and other facilities in Japan and to use VPPA in Australia.

By introducing IT solutions, we are contributing to emissions reductions for our customers, most notably with respect to Scope 2 and Scope 3. As a specific initiative underway since FY2004, the Fujitsu Group has been quantitatively evaluating the environmental impact reduction effect (i.e., achieved reductions in carbon dioxide emissions) brought by solutions and certifying those products and services having a reduction effect of 15% or more as “environmentally friendly solutions.” (Total number of certifications: 500) In addition, we quantitatively evaluate the extent to which the introduction of IT solution-based products reduces customers’ environmental impact from the following perspectives. 1) We evaluate the environmental contribution effects that the introduction of an IT solution has. Our focus includes increased operational efficiency and other efficiency- related effects within the IT solution’s energy and resource-saving effects. 2) We evaluate both factors that increase environmental impact and those that reduce environmental impact, and then clearly indicate the overall environmental contribution effect.

In our company's renewable power procurement strategy, increasing the ratio of renewable energy in Japan, where promotion of renewable energy is lagging behind from the standpoint of users, will also affect the ratio of renewable energy in other users. As a result, efforts to make maximum use of the power transmission network to increase renewable energy will be activated. In 2022, electric power companies in Japan and our company collaborated to conduct a demonstration test using electric power companies' transmission facilities in order to realize a dynamic rating (technology that flexibly operates transmission capacity of transmission and transformation facilities), which is expected as a next-generation power network technology to expand the introduction of renewable energy. The Agency for Natural Resources and Energy (Agency for Natural Resources and Energy) started a non-farm type connection in 2021, which is one of the efforts of the Japanese version of Connect & Manage. In the future, if there is a physical shortage of the transmission network, investment in the expansion of the transmission network capacity will be developed.

However, due to the change of the non-fossil certificate system in November 2021, it became possible to purchase directly from customers without going through a retail electricity provider, and cost reduction became possible by forming a scheme to procure at the head office. It is still higher than in Europe, so it is necessary to change the system to make it even cheaper in the future. However, the lowest price of renewable energy will go up from 2023, and the cost of renewable energy procurement in our company will rise again. Japan Lack of electricity market structure supporting bilateral PPAs Other, please specify (・It is unclear how to properly account for the loss or loss. ・There is no clear guidance on whether the commodity is subject to the Commodity Futures Trading Act.) With regard to Japan's established VPPA mechanisms in Europe and Oceania, Japan has participated in the Japan Climate Leaders Partnership (JCLP) and the Renewable Energy Foundation's corporate group activities related to the promotion of renewable energy. Although a guide on VPPA has already been published and is now being established, there are still some issues unique to Japan, such as the lack of accounting treatment for purchase costs, etc., which have made it impossible to resolve the situation in which the options for procurement of renewable electricity are becoming limited. Currently, there is no option to easily purchase renewable energy at low prices other than the purchase of non-fossil certificates, and in the future, the government should increase the number of options considering the case where non-fossil certificates cannot be purchased.

C11.1d (C11.1d) What is your strategy for complying with the systems you are regulated by or anticipate being regulated by? In cases where participation is required by laws and regulations, etc., Fujitsu will work towards reducing emissions (or achieve target ratios) as much as possible through voluntary efforts. And while observing social and market trends, Fujitsu will participate when a reliable trading system has been established. With regard to Fujitsu's efforts to reduce emissions, we formulated the Fujitsu Climate and Energy Vision in 2017, a medium and long-term environmental initiative spanning to 2050 designed to achieve decarbonization in the long term. This was recognized as a Science-Based Target (SBT), scientific GHG reduction goal. In 2020, We are Science Based Targets (SBT) 1.5°C certified. The goal of SBT is to “reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 71.4% compared to 2013 by 2030 .” This goal is in line with the greenhouse gas emission reduction strategy laid out in the Paris Agreement. And Reported to the Board of Directors as in the Fujitsu Group Environmental Action Plan (Stage X) for FY2021-2022, it has set a goal of ''reducing GHG emissions from business sites by 4.2% or more annually, compared with the base year (FY2013) '' in line with the SBT1.5°C target. These were presented and discussed by the Sustainability Management Committee, which is chaired by the Representative Director & President and comprising the heads of business groups and regions. In Japan, various measures are being taken to reduce the energy consumption rate by 1% on average in a span of 5 years in accordance with the Energy Conservation Law. Each location sets planned values for GHG emissions, including energy usage, and the Environmental division reviews the Group's overall expected achievement rate based on these planned values. In addition, the Environmental division uses an in-house data collection system to periodically monitor energy usage and other data for each location. In the event issues such as exceeding the planned value by a large margin occur, the Environmental division manages the overall progress towards achievement and compliance with laws and regulations through encouraging efforts to achieve targets and the like. Our efforts have allowed us to continuously achieve our goals through to 2022. As a result, we has continued to score “S ranks” in the business classification evaluation system of the Energy Conservation Law, which has been in place since 2016. For example, Fujitsu's Kamata Plant is subject to Tokyo's Cap-and-Trade Program. Through the abovementioned target management and reduction measures (Promotion of highly efficient energy use through operation management by the Central Monitoring System for Building Equipment and building inspectors), the plant has never exceeded the allocated amount, and as of 2022, there has been no need to supplement the reduction through emissions trading.

As time has passed the situation has slowly improved, with more and more village land being progressively excised from the forest estate as land tenure and planning practices have improved. The Katingan Project is designed and implemented to fully recognize customary rights and community land tenure. The project has facilitated participatory land-use mapping and demarcated land-use boundaries in the project-zone villages based on customary rights. While this process has allowed a formal consensus to be reached on the project area, the process has also helped local communities to resolve conflicts within the wider project zone. The outcomes can then feed directly into local planning processes and get formal recognition. Comment C11.3 (C11.3) Does your organization use an internal price on carbon?

The expenses required are recovered from each business unit in proportion to its amount of excess. Each office and business unit fully understands this system and recognizes that recovery represents “risk.” This recognition provides a major motivation for Group entities to strengthen their efforts to conserve energy and introduce renewable energy (a motivation to engage in internal activities in all regions, divisions, and operations). Thus, the primary objective of introducing internal carbon pricing is to encourage internal behavioral changes and improve energy efficiency to achieve each business site’s goals. Internal carbon pricing helps to push the decision-making process toward lower carbon in capital expenditure and operations. C12.

Moreover, we include CO2 reduction activities as one of our requirements in our Green Procurement Standard and request all (100%) of our suppliers to comply. The reason we require this to 100% of our suppliers is that the Fujitsu Group endeavors on environmental activities in all of its business realms, and the procurement of more materials and parts with low environmental impact is one facet of these activities. Impact of engagement, including measures of success We survey and find out the implementation status of our ''key suppliers'', particularly those involving in our main products and those with large transactions with us.  ・As an indicator of the success of the collaboration, the company is working with an annual target of a survey response rate of 90% or more based on the judgment that emissions and trends can be sufficiently grasped. In FY 2022, 95.9% of suppliers responded, achieving the target.  ・The results of the survey are reflected in Fujitsu Group's supplier evaluation, and corrective requests are being made to suppliers with insufficient activities.  ・We also analyze responses and provide feedback about activity trends to suppliers who participated in the implementation survey, and request them further promotion of these activities. For example, we support the implementation of energy saving measures such as heat insulation and energy-saving operations for a supplier's manufacturing equipment based on results of such information gathering. We helped the supplier expect 4% reduction of GHG emission and build consciousness towards energy conservation for the supplier. To roll out these activities on upper stream of the supply chain, we have requested our key suppliers to ask their business partners (second-tier suppliers from Fujitsu Group's perspective) to implement these activities.  ・In fiscal 2022, 24.2% of major business partners requested their own business partners to carry out activities, up from 23.5% in fiscal 2021. In total, more than 61,000 suppliers have been asked to carry out the activities but is expected to have a significant ripple effect on the upstream supply chain.

Impact of engagement, including measures of success As a new initiative from FY2022, we have requested our major suppliers to set CO2 reduction targets in line with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which is the international standard. In addition to suppliers of parts and materials related to manufacturing, which are the conventional targets of CO2 emission reduction, the targets have been expanded to include suppliers in the service field to more strongly promote global warming mitigation efforts. Since this was an advanced attempt that demanded we set targets in accordance with international standards, we considered it necessary to carefully explain the background to the activities, including the social situation, to our suppliers and seek their understanding and cooperation. We set 80% or more attendance as an indicator of success. We requested 293 companies to attend a briefing session; 261 companies participated. We believe that the 89.1% attendance rate was quite a success. In addition, study sessions (webinars) were held to explain the procedures for setting targets and to discuss FAQs and other information. We support our suppliers' CO2 emission reduction activities by providing a simple tool that enables visualization of their [SCOPE 1 and 2] CO2 emissions and determines compliance with SBTi standard target setting. Comment We held a briefing session on setting reduction targets in line with the SBTi, and 89.1% of our targeting suppliers participated in the session in FY2022. C12.1b CDP Page   of 125 73  ===== PAGE 74 ===== (C12.1b) Give details of your climate-related engagement strategy with your customers. Type of engagement & Details of engagement Education/information sharing Share information about your products and relevant certification schemes (i.e. Energy STAR) % of customers by number 59 % of customer - related Scope 3 emissions as reported in C6.5 0.3 Please explain the rationale for selecting this group of customers and scope of engagement Given that almost all of FUJITSU's ICT products are provided to business customers, the acquisition of the ENERGY STAR certification directly relates to whether we can secure business opportunities particularly because the Europe region customers accounting for 71% of the sales revenue of our overseas sales bases and the Americas region customers accounting for 6% quite often specify that the acquisition of the certification is a requirement for procurement. In addition, the acquisition of this certification is an appeal factor demonstrating that we actively employ energy-saving technologies, continuously engage in advancing energy efficiency and thereby drive forward our development of products capable of contributing to the reduction of electricity consumed by customers' use of products. For that reason, we have engaged in efforts to acquire the ENERGY STAR certification and to share information. [Scope of engagement] The Fujitsu's product groups targeted for engagement with customers through acquisition of ENERGY STAR are computers, displays, and imaging equipment, as those products are covered by the program. Engagement targets primarily the Europe and Americas region corporate customers. This is because many the Europe and Americas region corporate users require ENERGY STAR certification as a procurement requirement. Impact of engagement, including measures of success For PCs, based on the Energy Star standard, the ratio of products whose actual* TEC value (standard power consumption) is lower than the TEC Max (maximum value of the Energy Star standard) is calculated. According to this, 56% of new products launched in 2022 met the Energy Star standard. (TEC (Typical energy consumption) is a numerical value indicating the standard annual power consumption.) The incorporation of various technologies has contributed to reducing power consumption for customers during product usage and also led to Energy Star certifications (examples include incorporation of a new microprocessor with advanced energy conservation performance, high-efficiency power source, power-saving displays, optimization of low-power control, enhancement of the power management function, LSI integration, reduction of the numbers of components and incorporation of power-saving devices).As a specific example, the Energy Star TEC rate for FUJITSU Notebook LIFEBOOK U757 is 70% less than the maximum TEC rate that meets Energy Star requirements. Customers' power consumption during product usage is 17% less compared to the previous model (LIFEBOOK U536) even when including consumption from both standby and operation. By developing energy-saving products and communicating their energy-saving performance to customers through product catalogs, etc. and selecting Fujitsu products for customers, ''Scope 3 cat. 11'' is reduced as a result.Therefore, Fujitsu uses the ''Scope 3 cat. 11'' numbers as a measure of customer engagement success. Specifically, we believe that achieving ''Reduce CO2 emissions by 30% by FY2030 (Compared to FY2013)'' is a success. As a milestone, the Fujitsu Group's Environmental Action Plan Stage IX has set a target of '' Reducing CO2 emissions by 14% by FY2020 (compared to FY2013)''. At the moment, the Group has reduced emissions at a level exceeding the target. As a milestone, the Fujitsu Group's 10 Environmental Action Plan established the goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 17% by fiscal 2020 (compared to fiscal 2013 levels).Moreover, it contributes to abatement of emission (Scope3(cat.11)) of about 4,374tons-CO2 at the entire notebook PC.

The statement includes “decarbonization of the power sector,” “accelerating the use of renewable energy,” and “introduction of carbon pricing” among other recommendations. Details of exceptions (if applicable) and your organization’s proposed alternative approach to the policy, law or regulation For the Sixth Strategic Energy Plan’s FY2030 power source composition ratio, we suggest the following alternative approaches: 1. Decarbonize the power sector by 2035 2. Accelerate the maximum introduction of renewable energy as the power source with the highest priority and reduce dependence on fossil fuels 3. Achieve an early phase-out of coal-fired power generation without emission reduction measures For the positioning of carbon pricing within the Green Growth Strategy, we propose the following alternative approach: 4. Introduce carbon pricing that encourages the rapid expansion of cost-effective decarbonization technologies For the Green Growth Strategy’s automobile/battery industry growth strategy, we propose the following alternative approach: 5. Set a target of 100% ZEVs in new passenger car sales by 2035 as well as ambitious targets for large vehicles Have you evaluated whether your organization’s engagement on this policy, law, or regulation is aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement? Yes, we have evaluated, and it is aligned Please explain whether this policy, law or regulation is central to the achievement of your climate transition plan and, if so, how? While not central to achieving the Climate Change Transition Plan, progress in decarbonizing the power sector and introducing renewable energy will have a positive effect in terms of reducing Scope 2 and Scope 3 GHG emissions, as the grid GHG emission factor will come down, and thereby contribute to the plan’s achievement. If little progress is made in decarbonizing the power sector and introducing renewable energy, additional cost burdens will arise for the introduction of renewable energy.
