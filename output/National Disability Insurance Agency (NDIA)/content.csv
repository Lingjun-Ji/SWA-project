They have always looked after Country.  Country means the land, water, sky and  everything within them.    We respect the important connection that  First Nations people have with Country.    And we respect their Elders from the past  and now.   ===== PAGE 6 ===== Page 6 of 34    We recognise all people with disability.    We support an Australian community where  everyone can take part.    We also support the goals of the UN Convention  on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  We call it the UN Convention.    The UN Convention is an agreement  between countries.  It explains how everyone should treat  people with disability fairly.   ===== PAGE 7 ===== Page 7 of 34  About our Annual Report     The National Disability Insurance Scheme supports  people with disability across Australia.  We call it the NDIS.    Each year, we write a report about the work we’ve  done in the past year.     We have been writing these reports for 11 years.    We write them for the people who need to know  how we do our work.   ===== PAGE 8 ===== Page 8 of 34    This includes our participants.  Participants are people with disability who take  part in the NDIS.    This includes providers.  Providers support people with disability  by delivering a service.    It also includes the:     • governments in Australia    • people who work for us.    This report also talks about how we support the  important work the disability community does.   ===== PAGE 9 ===== Page 9 of 34  A message from our Chair    Mr Kurt Fearnley is the Chair of the National  Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) Board.  We just call it the NDIA Board.  This means he helps make important decisions  and lead the NDIA.     Kurt Fearnley is a person with disability.  He uses a wheelchair.    He said the NDIS is now 11 years old.    He said the Australian Government gave  us $720 million to make the NDIS better  in 2023 to 2024.    He said the Australian Government is changing  some of the laws about how the NDIS works.   ===== PAGE 10 ===== Page 10 of 34    The new laws will:    • make NDIS plans easier to understand  and use    • better protect participants from fraud.    Fraud is when a person does something with  money that is not honest.  Fraud is a crime.    Kurt Fearnley said more participants are taking  part in community and social activities.       ===== PAGE 11 ===== Page 11 of 34    He said the NDIS helped more family members  and carers:  • go back to work  • earn money.    He said more First Nations people are getting  disability support for the first time.    Kurt Fearnley said putting the needs of  participants first makes the NDIS better.    He said we will keep working with the disability  community to make the NDIS stronger.   ===== PAGE 12 ===== Page 12 of 34  A message from our Chief Executive Officer    Ms Rebecca Falkingham is the  Chief Executive Officer of the NDIA.  This means she runs the NDIA.    She said that this has been an important  year for the NDIS.    She said that over the past year, we have  heard a lot of good ideas about how to make  the NDIS better.  And these ideas have guided our work.         ===== PAGE 13 ===== Page 13 of 34    Rebecca Falkingham said the work we have done  means we can:      • support participants the way they need    • focus on achieving our goals.    She said we will keep using co-design to make the  NDIS better for participants.  Co-design is when people work together  to plan something.   Rebecca Falkingham said we are now using a new  computer system to:    • make the NDIS easier to understand    • help us make the NDIS better.   ===== PAGE 14 ===== Page 14 of 34    She also said we have a new First Nations Group.    The First Nations Group will help us make  services better:    • in areas far away from cities and towns    • for First Nations participants and their  families and carers.       ===== PAGE 15 ===== Page 15 of 34    Rebecca Falkingham said we are creating safe  workplaces for all our staff.    A workplace is any place you might work, such as:    • an office    • at home.       ===== PAGE 16 ===== Page 16 of 34  Working together    At the end of June 2024, we had 661,000  participants taking part in the NDIS.    Last year, we used co-design to work with the  disability community to improve the NDIS.    We wanted to make sure the NDIS could:    • give participants the support they need    • improve home and living supports.     ===== PAGE 17 ===== Page 17 of 34  Our people    We want to make sure the people who work for us:    • have the right skills    • come from all parts of the  Australian community.    We want to make sure our workplaces support  and value our staff with disability.    We want to hire more people with disability.  We want to be one of the best organisations  in the world at doing this.        ===== PAGE 18 ===== Page 18 of 34    We want to create more inclusive workplaces  for people from different backgrounds.    When something is inclusive, everyone:  • can take part  • feels like they belong.    Our workers helped us make new plans to make  our workplaces more inclusive.    This includes workers:  • with disability  • from different backgrounds.   ===== PAGE 19 ===== Page 19 of 34  Making the NDIS better    We are always working to make the NDIS better.  The law about the NDIS    We follow a law called the National Disability  Insurance Scheme Act 2013.  We call it the NDIS Act.    The Australian Government changed some  parts of the NDIS Act over the past year.    These changes will make the NDIS:  • last for a long time  •  be better for participants.   ===== PAGE 20 ===== Page 20 of 34    The changes to the NDIS Act used some ideas  from the NDIS Review.    The Australian Government checked the NDIS  to find out what:  • works well  • could be better.  They called it the NDIS Review.    We also thought about how we could use ideas  from the Disability Royal Commission.    The Disability Royal Commission looked into  problems people with disability have experienced.  It helped the Australian Government find out:  • what went wrong  • what the Government should fix.   ===== PAGE 21 ===== Page 21 of 34    We will keep working to make sure participants  have a good experience with us.    And we will make sure participants are at the  centre of everything we do.    We want to support participants to:    • reach their goals    • get the support they need.       ===== PAGE 22 ===== Page 22 of 34    In 2023 to 2024, we focused on:    • supporting children when they find out  about their disability    • the way we make NDIS plans for participants    • the way we make decisions about who  can get home and living supports.     We also focused on stopping fraud in the NDIS.   ===== PAGE 23 ===== Page 23 of 34  Keeping track of how well the NDIS works    We keep track of:  • how well the NDIS is going  •  if we are achieving our goals.    In 2023 to 2024, we made some changes  to our plan for how we will work for the next  3 years.    These changes will help us make sure the NDIS:    • works well    • gives participants a good experience    • can support participants for a long time.   ===== PAGE 24 ===== Page 24 of 34    In 2023 to 2024, we improved information  to help participants understand how they can   use their NDIS plan.    We focused on supporting participants to have  more choice and control over their NDIS plan.    This includes how they can choose:  • their own goals  • who their providers are.    We also trained our workers on how to support  participants to better use their supports.       ===== PAGE 25 ===== Page 25 of 34  Using data to manage the cost of the NDIS    When we talk about data, we mean:  • facts   • information   • records.     In 2023 to 2024, we looked at data from the  past 12 months to work out the costs of the   NDIS in the future.    We need to make sure we manage our money  for the NDIS well.  This includes now and in the future.   ===== PAGE 26 ===== Page 26 of 34  Managing how much the NDIS costs    We focus on managing our money well.    This will make sure the NDIS can:    • achieve its goals    • last a long time.       ===== PAGE 27 ===== Page 27 of 34    We share a report each year about how much  the NDIS costs.    A person who does not work for the NDIA makes  this report.  They make sure the report is honest.    In 2023 to 2024, the report shared that  changes to the NDIS have helped it to cost less.    The report also shared that we managed our  money better in the past year.    We will spend around $210 billion on the NDIS  in the coming 4 years.  This is less than what we first thought.   ===== PAGE 28 ===== Page 28 of 34  Thank you!     Thank you for reading our Annual Report.    And thank you for being part of our community.
