As with so many involved with the  Corporation, I have some deep personal  background with the ABC as a senior executive,  as a program maker (in television and radio), as  a musician, as a subject of media interrogation,  as a commentator and as a devoted consumer  of its services. The ABC has been an integral  part of my personal and professional life and  a source of learning, entertainment and deep  connection with issues, imaginations, news and  opinion about Australia and the world, from my  childhood, onwards. I am an ABC devotee and,  together with my Board colleagues, accept the  challenge of committed custodianship with  genuine relish.  In writing for last year’s annual report my  predecessor Ita Buttrose AC OBE wrote that  the ABC has endured because we have always  adapted and evolved with the Australian  public and the media environment in which we  operate. That is undoubtedly true, although  the turbulence and challenge of change in  the operating environment is evolving with  a speed and unpredictably that is pervasive  and awesomely powerful. It requires serious  strategic review in order that the ABC continues  as an institution which is provably fit for purpose  in responding with agility to meet diverse  identified needs in the Australian community  as never before.  In our media landscape change is occurring  with greater velocity, often with destructive  force, than ever before. And underlying it  everywhere is digital technology. Technology  which has enabled one of the largest transfers  of power in human history – from traditional  authorities to consumers (who I prefer to  call citizens). The information, education,  entertainment, artistic and communications  innovations it makes possible are extraordinary  and must be harnessed because they have  changed the settings in the landscape forever. There is no wonder that many commentators  look with alarm at the disarray in media that  has been fuelled and facilitated from digital  innovation, resulting in serious commercial  challenges to the operational viability in  many communities. There has been a need to  respond to a wholesale assault on revenues  and audiences.  The devastation has also involved an assault  on the moral resources that hold our society  together. Including on the qualities good media  organisations offer: objectivity and truth,  without which democracy becomes impossible  to sustain. In this landscape littered with tarnished hopes  and compromised trust, one organisation  stands firmly: the ABC. The most trusted media  organisation in our nation. Trusted by 78 per cent  of Australians in 2023–2024.1 In fact, the ABC is  19 per cent higher than its closest platform2. In order for the Corporation to serve the  nation well in this era dominated by dramatic  change, I and my board colleagues believe it is  imperative to aim over the course of the next  few months to develop an invigorated sense of  purpose for contemporary relevance at the ABC  which is drawn from the Charter and the other  core elements of the ABC Act. We are of the  view that we must consciously reference these  primary instruments that artfully describe  the ABC remit in terms to meet today’s needs  ensuring we are well aligned in determining  the right priorities to serve Australians well.  This will require a cultural renewal in many  settings at the ABC and a determination to  thoughtfully review our performance with  a keen eye on our never ending obligations  to the community and the many audiences  contained within it. The ABC is, after all, owned  by all Australians.  Foreword  from the Chair 1	 ABC Corporate Tracking Program, 2023–2024 Annual Performance Statements. 2	 ABC Corporate Tracking Program, 2023–2024 Annual Performance Statements. 2  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 5 ===== The Board agrees that the purpose and  success of the ABC is only ever evidenced and  measured in the quality, originality, diversity  and relevance of its content and the proven  connection with the multiplicity of Australian  audiences. Our video, audio, text and pictorial  content output in news and current affairs,  children’s, documentary, drama, varied light  entertainment, sport, music, religion and all the  other genres is our sole reason for being. It has  to receive the maximum effort in the priorities  of our consideration as to policy, resourcing,  advocacy and critical review. We all agree that the huge body of content  delivered to Australians will have much higher  strategic prioritisation. In financial allocation,  impacts on Australian content will always  be measured first. In matters of finance and  budget we must aim to have a first order priority  to our news and current affairs and general  Australian content. In a similar vein we believe we need to  undertake as a board, a thoughtful appraisal of  the ABC’s performance against the nominated  content priorities and the content themes which  are specific requirements of the Charter as the  Corporation’s dedicated areas of responsibility  under the ABC Act, and to listen to community  feedback to ensure that we are on message  in aiming to be an improved force for social  cohesion. Our purpose is an avowed dedication  to the national interest in ways which celebrate  and interrogate Australia as the mirror, camera  and microphone to the nation.

ABC 7.30 presenter  Sarah Ferguson.   13  ===== PAGE 16 ===== The year ahead Compelling Australian content, and the highest quality impactful  journalism, will remain at the heart the Corporation’s purpose. We will  continue to serve all Australians into the future, as we have for the last  92 years. In his Redmond Barry Lecture at the State  Library of Victoria in June 2024, the Chair of  the ABC Board, Kim Williams AM, challenged  the organisation to strengthen its role as a  force for democracy, national identity and  social cohesion. He proposed conceiving of the  ABC as a “reimagined national campfire” for  Australia where “we all come together to share  our ideas, dreams, friendship and our sense of  common purpose to enable our country to face  much of the darkness beyond, with confidence  and strength”. In the coming year, the ABC will respond to this  challenge by continuing to adapt and evolve  its services to meet the needs of the nation.  At a time of rising misinformation and  disinformation, exacerbated by social media  and, in some cases, generative AI technologies,  the ABC’s role as a source of reliable and  accurate news and information for all  Australians has never been more important.  During the coming year, the Corporation will  strengthen its contributions to sustaining  Australian democracy through initiatives that  encourage an informed citizenry. The Corporation will also modernise its News  website and app to broaden their appeal and  enable audiences to quickly find stories of  relevance and interest to them. The redesigned  site will support increased personalisation  while retaining a core of curated news. In late 2024, the ABC will launch an expanded  media literacy strategy aimed at delivering  resources for school-age and adult Australians.  The strategy will have the twin focuses of  informing Australians about issues, events and  matters of importance to the democracy of their  nation and promoting the media literacy skills  needed to participate in a democratic society. The Corporation will again play a vital role  informing Australians during the federal  election that is expected to be held during  the coming year. It will both cover the issues  that are live in the campaign and explain the  electoral process, employing ABC-owned and  third-party media platforms to maximise the  availability and accessibility of this information  for all to Australians. (During the 2022 Election,  the ABC’s explainer videos on TikTok reached  30% of Australians aged 18–24.) The ABC will deliver an array of original  Australian productions on ABC television and  ABC iview. In the second half of 2024, these will  include Shaun Micallef’s Eve of Destruction,  Guy Montgomery’s Guy Mont Spelling Bee, The  Assembly, Return to Paradise, Plum and Muster  Dogs: Where Are They Now?, and return series  of Take 5 with Zan Rowe, Question Everything,  Grand Designs Australia, Headliners and Fisk. In September 2024, triple j will host the first free,  regional One Night Stand concert in five years,  bringing a range of high-quality musical acts to  audiences in Warrnambool. During the year, the Corporation will refresh  ABC’s Radio National and continue to commit  resources to local ABC Radio services around  the country to enable an increased level of  engagement with local communities. Following the decision of US technology  company Meta not to renew content licensing  agreements with Australian news organisations,  the ABC’s current agreement with Meta will  expire later this year. This deal has helped fund  the placement of more journalists outside the  capital cities and an expansion of rural and  regional coverage.  14  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 17 ===== Photo shows ABC Managing Director David Anderson giving a speech at a lectern. The Corporation remains committed to  journalism in all parts of Australia and will  manage the challenge created by this loss of  revenue on a whole-of-ABC basis. We will be  maintaining our critical presence in regional,  rural and remote Australia at its current levels.  In addition, the ABC will continue to work with  Government to respond to this issue. In the second half of 2024, the ABC will launch  its second Elevate Reconciliation Action Plan  (RAP). The three-year Plan will evolve and  extend the work, begun in its first Elevate RAP,  of normalising the use of Aboriginal and Torres  Strait Islander place names and languages  across ABC programs and services. It will also  give a greater focus to First Nations stories,  experiences and perspectives in ABC content. Finally, emergency broadcasting will remain  a critical focus for the Corporation in 2024–25.  In a changing climate, emergencies, including  cyclones, bushfires, floods and heatwaves, are  becoming more frequent and more severe with  longer-lasting impact on communities across  the country.  The ABC helps communities prepare for  these disasters, keeps them informed as they  unfold, and continues to tell their stories as  they recover. The number of ABC emergency  activations has risen sharply in recent years —  from 191 in 2020–21, through 309 in 2021–22 to 455  in 2022–23 and 659 in 2023–24. As the national  emergency broadcaster, the Corporation will  continue to plan and provide this valuable  service wherever, and whenever, it’s needed.  In August 2024, after more than five years as  Managing Director, I informed ABC Chair Kim  Williams of my intention to leave the ABC.  This decision has not been an easy one. I am  still very much committed to the importance  of the ABC to the nation. I believe it is the right  moment for leadership renewal for the next  stage of the ABC’s continued evolution. To have  the opportunity to serve the Australian public  and lead such talented and dedicated people  across the country, and overseas, for what is  approaching six years is humbling. To have had  this opportunity after a long career at the ABC  is an achievement I am proud of and incredibly  grateful for.

Our investigative work exposed  important public interest issues and led to  changes that have had meaningful and positive  impacts on people’s lives. Our Emergency  Broadcasting team was alongside Australians  in their times of greatest need, during fires,  floods, cyclones and other extreme weather  events. Our regional radio bureaux told  the stories of our communities and shared  them across our nation. Our international  correspondents brought the world to us  through Australian eyes.  Whether exploring key domestic issues such  as the cost of living or covering significant  national stories such as the Voice to Parliament  Referendum, reporting from the conflict zones in  Israel-Gaza and Ukraine, or creating compelling  original content such as political docuseries  Nemesis, our journalism has been informative  and engaging. Driving all our initiatives is the Audience- First News editorial strategy which launched  in September 2023. Its focus is to ensure we  prioritise the highest value journalism, create a  digital-first mindset across all teams, establish  a performance-driven, skilled and inclusive  News culture, engage the community and  always put the audience first in all our thinking.  For the first time we created an ABC News  Purpose Statement which sets out the core  values that underpin everything we do:  independence, excellence, authenticity, Justin Stevens Image shows a trio of Liberal Prime Ministers, Tony Abbott, Scott Morrison and Malcolm Turnbull, wearing suits.

Throughout the year  we actively worked with teams to meet our  editorial standards and uphold our journalistic  values of accuracy, impartiality, excellence  and independence.  A priority in the 12 months was continuing  our digital transformation in order to connect  our best and most valuable journalism with  more Australians. As audiences increasingly  source their news and information from digital  platforms, we’re ensuring our stories are there  to meet them and that we’re utilising the  formats that make the most of those platforms.  This included enhancing our services on the ABC  News website and app, ABC listen, ABC iview  and social networks.  At the same time, we maintained our  commitment to the high-quality broadcast  services our audiences also expect, continuing  to serve our loyal viewers and listeners on  television and radio.  Serving the needs of both digital and linear  audiences within a fixed funding envelope  sometimes meant making difficult decisions  on where we invest our effort and resources,  but putting the audience at the centre of our  decisions always drives our thinking.  This year saw the ABC’s regional bureaux unite  with the existing News division to create one  new, nationwide team. We are by far the biggest  newsgathering team in Australia, with around  2000 employees located in 58 regional bureaux,  the eight state and territory capitals and 12  international posts. Our metro and regional  newsrooms now work much more closely  together, strengthening and enriching our  journalism and bringing heft to our storytelling  across the country.  The ABC’s Emergency Broadcasting team also  became part of News. This is Australia’s only  specialised team of its kind, providing reliable  information during emergencies that can  help save lives and property. From 1 July 2023 –  30 June 2024 there were 659 emergency events  nationally. The EB team, supported by our local  radio network, provides critical messaging  and rolling coverage via the ABC’s local radio  network and on television and digital platforms.  During the year we created a Climate Team to  provide specialist expert reporting on climate  and environmental issues. Data visualisation,  graphics and compelling visual elements  enhance its storytelling and translate complex  issues for the audience.  The ABC also announced the formation of  the specialist ABC NEWS Verify team for  scrutinising and verifying information in online  communities as well as reporting its own  original stories.  Another priority was continuing to foster the  culture of equity and inclusion within ABC  News and ensuring our workplaces are the  best environment they can be for everyone who  works in them. Greater diversity of experiences  in our workforce supports our journalism by  providing more insights and knowledge of  the varied experiences of modern Australian  audiences, and results in richer storytelling.  Our key challenge during the year was the  same faced by all media organisations: the  seismic shifts occurring in technology and  audience behaviour which continue to disrupt  and transform the global media landscape.  These included the emergence of generative  AI, fragmenting audiences, the public  retreating to siloed spaces for debate and  discourse, growing distrust of big media and  institutions, increasing risk of disinformation  and misinformation, and information overload  on the part of the consumer.  The ABC Five-Year Plan sets out how we will  meet these challenges by continuing to adapt  and evolve as technology, audience behaviour  and demographic changes transform the media  market and society.  All our initiatives reflect what is asked of us  in the ABC Charter: to provide innovative and  comprehensive broadcasting and digital media  services of a high standard, which contribute to  a sense of national identity, inform and entertain  Australians, reflect the cultural diversity of  the community and encourage awareness and  understanding of Australia internationally.    19  ===== PAGE 22 ===== Lisa Millar and a star of Muster Dogs: Where Are They Now? 20  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 23 ===== Turning to the ABC  ABC News is committed to delivering high value,  relevant trusted information to all Australians.  The ABC’s regional bureaux joined the News  division in July 2023. Having regional, metro  and rural teams collaborating in one team has  increased the impact of the journalism and is  better serving audiences across the country.  This collaboration is key during natural  disasters. There was an early start to the  bushfire season in the Northern Territory,  Queensland, New South Wales and Tasmania,  followed by Western Australia in November  2023. Cyclone Jasper crossed the coast of Far  North Queensland in December, then Cyclone  Kirrily in January 2024. Bushfires and storms  hit Victoria hard in February, with more wild  and wet weather impacting communities in  New South Wales in April.  The return of Stateline in January 2024 delivered  agenda-setting, original stories and probing  interviews in all state and territories. Stateline  content features the strongest state and  territory coverage from across the ABC’s  network of newsrooms and regional Local  Radio teams, including in-depth investigations,  long‑form interviews and compelling features,  across all platforms.  In its first week, Stateline stories dominated  the news nationally. The Tasmanian Premier  flagged an early election, while South Australia  exclusively revealed Snowtown accomplice  Mark Ray Haydon was set for release after  25 years. Since then, there have been more  than 150 digital-first articles published on  web and app with a combined 15 million page  views. These include an in-depth look at alcohol  bans and the implosion of the Aboriginal legal  aid service in the Northern Territory, student  welfare and police call outs in New South Wales,  youth crime in Queensland, and the ongoing  trauma associated with forced adoptions in  Western Australia.  The rural journalism from the nearly 80-year-old  Country Hour program was taken to the rest of  Australia via digital platforms and Landline.  Similarly, the regional radio network surfaced  unique Australian stories, amplified across  News’ platforms.  The ABC’s international coverage, the most  comprehensive foreign correspondent  network in the Australian news media, is key  to connecting Australians with the world.  Teams were on the ground covering the  unfolding events in Israel/Gaza and Ukraine  throughout the year in an increasingly difficult  environment. The Foreign Correspondent  team reported not only on global conflicts but  also from Cambodia, Iraq, Canada, Germany,  Barbados, Argentina and South Korea.  The investment in Asia Pacific journalism  again saw an increase in focus on the region,  with expert coverage of the Indonesian and  Indian elections as well as in-depth coverage  of the PNG landslide.  As always, ABC teams provided comprehensive  coverage of events such as Anzac Day and  Remembrance Day.  Other major stories this year included the  return to Australia of Julian Assange, the Greg  Lynn trial in Victoria, major corporate data  breaches, increasing cost of living pressures  and Bruce Lehrmann’s defamation case in the  Federal Court.  The digital-first expert climate team covered  varied aspects of the impacts of climate change,  including weather, energy, infrastructure and  the economy.    21  ===== PAGE 24 ===== The News Breakfast team continued to engage  the audience with entertaining interviews,  lively conversation and the latest breaking  news. The program’s week-long focus on  domestic violence in May 2024 looked at not  only the problem but also potential solutions.  The News Channel team and News Radio  provided audiences with continuous coverage  of stories as they happened around Australia  and the world. The audio and video continuous  news platforms perform a key function in rapidly  ramping up live coverage when big stories  break, and their live output is a key enabler  for on-demand video and audio coverage.  Background Briefing’s high impact  investigations included a moving series on  the death of Western Sydney man Bradley  Balzan, who was shot by police. Q+A continued  its role as the home of conversation between  audiences and those in power.  The Four Corners team continued to hold  the powerful to account, exposing scandals,  triggering inquiries and firing debate.  Australia’s premier daily current affairs program  7.30 delivered agenda setting public affairs  journalism and nightly interviews. There were  at least two significant regulatory decisions  affecting the lives of many Australians that  stemmed from the program’s reporting: the  new national standards for cosmetic surgery  operators and the world-first national ban on  engineered stone. Australian Story’s compelling  narrative storytelling has found an audience  well beyond traditional appointment to  view programming. The audio current affairs  programs AM, PM and The World Today, along  with RN Breakfast and Drive, continue their  rich tradition of in-depth storytelling reporting.  Local connections  Engagement with communities around the  country is a key plank of the Audience-First  News strategy, ensuring the ABC is telling the  relevant stories people need and want to know.  Crowd sourced investigations added weight to  agenda-setting journalism. 7.30’s investigation  into strata management company Netstrata  resulted in NSW Fair Trading launching an  inquiry into the business.  Local regional radio is a key way for ABC News to  directly connect with local communities across  the country. The conversations and stories  ensure that local communities’ experiences are  reflected and amplified to a national audience. The Embedded Reporting Project once again  connected with remote communities and  resulted in compelling content. Reporters  travelled to Dargo and Mallacoota in regional  Victoria, Lord Howe Island in New South Wales,  Alpurrurulam in the Northern Territory and  Lucinda in North Queensland.  The ABC News Community Impact Team is  focused on elevating young storytellers in  regional Australia. Its regular projects include  ABC Takeover and ABC Heywire, inspiring  events that find and engage communities and  young talent. In May 2024, Takeover Lismore  involved students from all nine high schools  in the Lismore area, demonstrating the strong  engagement of the local community.  ABC News has a number of partnerships to  support community-based media organisations,  including the Local and Independent News  Association (LINA) and First Nations Media  Australia. It aims to support career pathways  for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people  working in media and diversify the range of  First Nations stories, voices and communities  represented in media.  22  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 25 ===== On 6 May 2024, the ABC officially opened its new broadcast facility located  at Parramatta, boosting its effectiveness in Greater Western Sydney.  An event to mark the opening was led by  ABC Chair Kim Williams AM, ABC Managing  Director David Anderson and Member  for Parramatta Dr Andrew Charlton MP.  Other dignitaries included City of Parramatta  Lord Mayor, Councillor Pierre Esber, State  Member for Parramatta Donna Davis MP, and  Executive Director of Business Western Sydney  David Borger.  The increased presence in Parramatta is a key  part of the ABC’s Five-Year Plan, providing new  and improved workspaces while supporting  the target of 75% of content makers working  outside the Ultimo head office by 2025. The new  bureau will serve as a model for the ABC in the  future: a sophisticated technology facility that  promotes new production practices with agile  content sharing and distribution.  ABC Parramatta will increase the corporation’s  presence in the nation’s fastest growing  residential region, where 2.6 million people  – one in every 10 Australians – live. One of the  ABC’s strengths over its 90-year history has  been its ability to adapt and innovate to meet  the changing needs of the Australian public and  being part of the community wherever they live.  Mornings on ABC Radio Sydney was the first  show to broadcast from the new facility  followed by other programs including Sydney  Drive and Weekends. Since then, many more  journalists, producers and digital content  teams have commenced working in Parramatta,  connecting and engaging with one of  Australia’s most diverse communities.  Later this year, two ground floor studios for use  by ABC News and ABC Radio Sydney teams will  open on the promenade, providing a further  point of connection with local audiences.

In January 2024, landmark three-part  documentary series Nemesis continued the  rich ABC News tradition of political history and  high-quality narrative storytelling. Combining  great broadcast skills with digital expertise, it  exemplifies the collaboration across ABC teams.  Our Parliamentary reporting team ensures we  give the same rigour to our political reporting,  providing important analysis and context for  the audience. Top quality audio services on both linear  and digital platforms include the ABC News  Daily podcast, which increased its average  per-episode audience by 26% in 2023. If You’re  Listening also had success in the podcast arena  and is doing double duty as a video offering,  which has seen it reach strong audiences on  ABC iview, YouTube and News Channel. The  most recent ABC News podcast, Not Stupid with  Julia Baird and Jeremy Fernandez, is aimed at  hard‑to‑reach audiences.  Across the year ABC News teams and journalists  won numerous major reporting awards,  including seven Walkley Awards, Young  Australian Journalist of the Year, NSW Young  Journalist of the Year, Queensland Journalist  and New Journalist of the Year, Best Rural and  Regional Journalist and Rural Photographer  of the Year in South Australia, and Rural Press  Club of Victoria Media Outlet of the Year.  ABC National Sport Reporter David Mark  received the prestigious AIPS (International  Sports Press Association) Sports Media Award  – the highest international accolade in the  sport media industry.  ABC teams also won prizes for journalistic, visual  and technical excellence in online, video and  audio news for investigative journalism, current  affairs, international reporting, regional and  community affairs, Indigenous and multicultural  affairs, sport, analysis, consumer affairs, human  rights, crime and court reporting, health and  science, business journalism and innovation.  Evolving the digital  audience experience Teams across the ABC collaborated on the  ‘Future News’ project to comprehensively  update the ABC News website and mobile apps,  a significant step forward in the ABC’s most  visited digital touchpoint that ensures our  online audience gets the best user experience  of Australia’s most trusted journalism.  Read more on p. 50. New digital roles in the Canberra Parliament  House bureaux and in the Investigative  Journalism & Current Affairs team are enhancing  our live and breaking digital news coverage,  including through live blogging unfolding  events across politics, finance and sport.  The addition of Lifestyle and Entertainment  verticals and content to the news site has  expanded the ABC’s appeal for lighter/ occasional users, younger people and women.  The vertical video team has increased audience  engagement via Instagram, TikTok and YouTube  Shorts. The ABC News Instagram account has  one million followers, making it the biggest  local news account on the platform, while its  Tik Tok equivalent has almost 500,000 followers.  The team is also increasingly producing vertical  video content for ABC platforms.  The Triton Australian Podcast Ranker shows  the ABC’s news and current affairs podcasts  are competitive with the most successful  on‑demand content being made anywhere.  ABC News Top Stories has been the No 1 news  podcast in Australia since it joined the ranker  in April and appears in the Top 3 podcasts in  the overall rankings. 24  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 27 ===== Reflecting contemporary  Australia  The 50:50 Equality project continues to  support News in maintaining balanced gender  representation in stories and telling more  stories prioritising women’s experiences.  Through talent diversity tracking, teams strive  for balanced gender representation in stories  while delivering more content aimed at female  audiences through innovative storytelling  projects and experimenting with distribution.  All News teams are tracking the representation  of Indigenous, culturally and linguistically  diverse Australians and people with disabilities  with the aim of increasing representation  of more diverse and varied Australian  experiences in our stories.  Next Gen Advisory Panel  In 2023 ABC News formed the Next Gen Advisory  Panel, which consists of 12 talented young staff  members. They bring different perspectives to  the challenges presented by a rapidly changing  media landscape and provide a sounding  board for proposed projects and content for  younger audiences.

ABC journalists working in bureaux across Australia reported  a myriad of political perspectives, legal considerations and social issues  that were driving the debate. Stories were crafted to reach ABC audiences  on platforms of their choice.  All contributions were monitored for political  perspectives and the data was recorded in  ABC’s Tracker to ensure perspectives were  easily referenced as the campaign progressed  to the 14 October vote.  Impartiality training sessions were held for  all News staff in accordance with the ABC’s  Editorial Policies. The knowledge base of ABC  staff to report this range of specialist content  was bolstered by the Referendum Reference  Group, a cross-divisional group formed in July  2023 that gathered relevant facts and resources  on the Referendum debate on an internal  SharePoint site. This staff-led initiative ensured  fact-based perspectives of First Nations people  were available to expand the audience’s  understanding of the debate.  The Voice to Parliament  Referendum Dancers at the 2023 Garma Festival in Gulkula.Photo shows Indigenous dancers daubed in yellow body paint performing. 26  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 29 ===== The ABC appointed a Voice correspondent,  Dan Bourchier, whose work was featured in  the Four Corners program ‘Muddy Waters:  Renegotiating Australia’s democracy’. Dan  hosted numerous episodes of The Drum along  with a special Q&A recorded at Garma. The ABC  commissioned a special eight-part series, One  Plus One – The Elders, as in-depth conversations  that delved into history, culture and the  potential Voice to Parliament.  As a precursor to the vote, ABC commissioned  the four-part television series Voices of  Australia. Hosted by Dan Bourchier, Bridget  Brennan and Isabella Higgins, it also produced  segments for social media circulation, with  one clip viewed by 2.2 million people on TikTok.  The Voice Referendum Explained podcast,  hosted by Carly Williams and Fran Kelly, was  a multiplatform offering that answered key  questions for the audience. It streamed as an  audio and video product and was also played  on News Channel. The coverage represented vastly different  political opinions, ranging from hard yes  on the question of the Referendum to  emphatic no and undecided, as well as from  Australians with diverse heritage and cultures.  Honestly held opinions and concerns were  respectfully ventilated.  On the day of the Referendum, ABC’s live TV  coverage Australia Votes: The Voice Referendum  reached three million viewers across ABC TV  and ABC News Channel. The program was  hosted by leading ABC political commentators,  with Bridget Brennan, David Speers, Dan  Bourchier, Laura Tingle and Anthony Green  breaking down the results as they emerged.  Local Radio covered the referendum across the  network. Radio National featured conversations  and debates in the lead-up to the polls, the  Awaye! podcast delved into the history and  faces of the campaign, and ABC Factual’s  Kitchen Cabinet with Annabel Crabb provided  an informal platform for Australia’s politicians  to share their views.  The ABC published 243 digital articles on the  Voice Referendum, achieving an accumulated  30.4 million page views. On 14 October, ABC News  Radio had 85,000 live streams on the ABC Listen  app and the ABC News Channel had 451,000 live  streams on ABC iview.   27  ===== PAGE 30 ===== ABC Content Director’s overview –  Chris Oliver-Taylor On 1 July 2023, the ABC Content Division began,  the first time that all non-news content was  overseen with one cohesive vision. Teams from  the former Entertainment & Specialist and  Regional & Local divisions joined together to  form the largest producer of screen, audio  and digital content in Australia. The new Content Division focuses our creative  output across all genres and platforms. On demand is increasingly how Australians  consume their media content and engage  with the ABC. It is vital that the ABC offers  its content to all Australians when they  want to watch or listen. To ensure the ABC  remains technologically competitive, the  ABC has delivered the next generation of ABC  iview featuring more personalisation, better  navigation, more channels and increased  accessibility. The ABC was one of the first  broadcasters in the world to introduce a  streaming service when ABC iview was  launched in 2008 and we remain committed  to innovation and ongoing improvements  to enhance the audience experience and  product functionality.  The formation of the Content division has also  resulted in improved commissioning structures  and processes, with our audiences front of mind  in everything we do. The ABC is the biggest  commissioner of Australian content across  many genres, and the leading supporter of  Australia’s independent production sector  generating outstanding local content for  Australian audiences. The ABC is renowned as the home of Australian  drama. Key titles include The Newsreader,  Ladies in Black, Total Control and Bay of Fires.  The brilliant cast, direction and ‘80s nostalgia  of The Newsreader has struck a chord with  audiences and season two of the series  reaffirmed its position as Australian television’s  premier drama in the past year with five  AACTA awards, as well as being named drama  series production of the year at the Screen  Producers Awards. The factual slate is a fundamental way that  the ABC can reflect Australia back to itself.  A diverse slate of content included Tony  Armstrong’s Extra-Ordinary Things and Better  Date Than Never, which followed a diverse  group of single love seekers. This year we  also introduced a new premium documentary  stream, Australian Features, to showcase  the country’s best contemporary factual  storytelling on ABC iview.  The ABC is synonymous with Comedy. Fisk,  Utopia and Austin are three of most successful  comedies of recent years, with Michael Theo  moving from Love on the Spectrum to a starring  role in Austin. All three shows are breaking  records for ABC iview audiences, but also  consistently delivering audiences above  1.5 million per episode. The ABC also supports  and nurtures local comedic talent on screen and  behind the scenes in development initiatives  such as Fresh Blood and our recurring coverage  of the Melbourne International Comedy Festival. Chris Oliver‑Taylor 28  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 31 ===== The ABC launched new multichannels to ensure  we connect with our audiences via clear brand  propositions, focused content that is easy to  find, and a direct link to ABC iview. The ABC  will continue to offer linear broadcast and on  demand content to ensure content is available  when the audience wants to watch. As well  as adding ABC Family and ABC Entertains, we  also launched multiple digital streams that  allow audiences to engage in content, primarily  focussed on Children, again giving audiences  other options to engage, learn, play and  be entertained.  The ABC brings Australia together, whether  on New Year’s Eve, with the Sydney Harbour  fireworks watched this year by 3.4 million  Australians, or through major sporting events  across our radio output, like the FIFA Women’s  World Cup and the Australian Open, or the  recently resurrected triple j One Night Stand.  All are available live, on demand and free on  ABC Radio and the ABC listen App.  The ABC’s quality podcasts continue to grow  audiences and meet consumption trends and  preferences.

In its  first year of operation, the ABC Content  division has embraced this tradition to deliver  innovative and creative programming across  all information and entertainment platforms  that reflects the Australian community in all  its diversity. The ABC is a constant and reliable  source of entertainment, and a constant and  reliable source of engagement and conversation  in communities around the country. ABC Content teams have provided crucial  information and services across all platforms,  information that serves the community and  saves lives. Local Radio’s key emergency  broadcasting role kept communities informed  over the past year during the fires in Perth,  Cyclone Megan in Darwin, and floods in  Adelaide, Brisbane, Darwin, Melbourne,  and Sydney. triple j’s Hack has been at the forefront  of reporting stories that engage young  Australians, while the trusted specialist  coverage of Radio National’s digital and  social storytelling exceeds hundreds of  thousands of views each week of subjects  including the psychology of misinformation and  disinformation, intersections of age, gender and  loneliness in Australia, housing affordability  and economic inequalities, elder abuse and  Australian history.

ABC stations opened their doors to  audiences, broadcast live from community  venues such as the State Library of Western  Australia, and featured voices and music from  1924 through the decades. Another historic  moment was achieved when ABC Sydney  presenters commenced broadcasting from  ABC Parramatta in May.  Last November, ABC Radio teams across the  country partnered with several charities in  a fund-raising effort to support vulnerable  communities across Australia.

Australia’s favourite  classical music event was then brought to life  in a special performance by the Melbourne  Symphony Orchestra and broadcast on ABC TV  and ABC iview. In June, the ABC and Melbourne  Symphony Orchestra also extended their screen  partnership until 2026.  The ABC celebrated the rich diversity of the arts  from around the country with the return of Arts  Week. Featuring special arts-themed content  across all platforms, it encouraged and inspired  Australians to get creative. The ABC’s Arts Week  content was headlined by The Whiteley Art  Scandal, which took a behind the scenes look  at the high-stakes world of art dealing and told  the story of one of Australia’s biggest art fraud  cases involving the work of Brett Whiteley. ABC iview showcased a number of arts  collections through the year including The Arts  on Stage, which featured live classical music,  opera, theatre and ballet performances and  championed the work of Australia’s most  acclaimed arts creatives and institutions. Working with ABC teams including ABC  Indigenous, Radio National and Arts, Music &  Events, the Digital Content & Innovation team  coordinated cross-platform coverage of the  2024 Venice Biennale, ensuring on-the-ground  coverage by Daniel Browning and Rudy Bremer  for First Nations artist Archie Moore’s Golden  Lion award for kith and kin.   33  ===== PAGE 36 ===== Content for all Australians  The ABC’s commitment to offer distinctively  Australian high-quality content to audiences  across all platforms saw the ABC Network  increase its broadcast reach and share in 2024,  the only Australian network to experience  growth in 2024.

ABC Education (abc.net.au/education) links  teachers, students and families to a range of educational media connected to  the Australian Curriculum and guided by the Early Years Learning Framework. With additional budgetary funding provided  in October 2022, the Corporation was able  to invest $1.75 million into the creation of two  new educational content initiatives including  BTN High, a shortform news segment directed  towards high school students. As a companion to BTN Newsbreak and BTN  Classroom, BTN High has a key role to play  in engaging kids and young people with  news. Providing accessible, age-appropriate  news throughout their schooling, will enable  young Australians to grow up with a strong  understanding of the world around them and  their place in it. All programs help reflect the  views and ideas of young Australians by giving  them a voice and platform on the issues that  matter most to them.  The 116 episodes since its January 2023 launch  have explored a wide range of issues relevant to  their audience, including vaping, doxxing, toxic  masculinity and body image. Its stories have  been viewed more than 10.5 million times across  all platforms, including Instagram and YouTube.  The episodes are designed to appeal to  teenage audiences while providing a valuable  educational tool for secondary schools.  Each story is mapped to relevant areas  of the Australian Curriculum to enhance  subject specific learning. In 2024, BTN High  has published weekly teaching resources  alongside its key stories.

The additional budgetary funding was also  behind the creation of ABC Education Studios,  which produces a range of media including  video, interactives and articles. Its 10 new projects covered topics including the  Official NAIDOC Education Resources, Yarrabil:  First Nations Songs, Body Systems, Money Maths  and Australia’s Extinct Megafauna. A six-part animation series with accompanying  palaeontologist interviews and educational  resources, Australia’s Extinct Megafauna  offers a great way for teachers and students to  learn about the unique megafauna that once  inhabited this land. The engaging collection  of resources teaches students not only about  fascinating prehistoric animals, but also the  exciting process of scientific discovery. The project exemplifies the importance of  strategic partners when making educational  content. The partnerships spanned the  museum sector (Museums Victoria, Queensland  Museum, Australian Museum, South Australian  Museum), the higher education sector  (University of Adelaide, Murdoch University,  Flinders University and Australia’s best  palaeontologists) and the schools’ education  sector (the Victorian Academy of Teaching  and Leadership and the Department of  Education, Victoria). The series also reflects collaboration between  ABC Science and ABC Education, with ABC  Education commissioning documentary  footage from Catalyst’s production Megafauna:  What killed Australia’s giants? to help students  learn about the work of palaeontologists.  The final resource provides two hours of  bespoke content for use in the classroom.

In 2023–24, P&T has worked to embed  leading edge practices around digital  product development, archival accessibility,  digitisation of broadcast, cybersecurity and  modernised production facilities using the  latest technologies to support our content  partners and engage our audience. Our Content and Distribution team has made  strides in emergency broadcasting, deploying  new monitoring technology and working  with our broadcast infrastructure partners  to improve resilience of ABC transmission.  This assists in providing local content to areas  impacted by emergencies.  This proactive fault monitoring improves  content delivery and ensures we meet our  Charter obligation to provide content for all  Australians. We have also identified several  transmission areas impacted by extreme  weather events and prioritised them for  infrastructure upgrades to improve site  resilience and personalised content delivery. In the area of production facilities, our radio  visualisation trial is now operational at the  Brisbane studios and will soon be deployed at  the new Parramatta broadcast facilities.  This innovative solution uses visual technology  to automatically create videos from radio  studio content, providing a wealth of  additional content for our news streams across  all platforms.  We are also actively evaluating the capabilities  of virtual and augmented reality production for  its potential to provide more efficient use of our  studio facilities and enhance visual storytelling  and audience engagement. Personalisation has been a key focus for us  this year. We have scaled recommendations  on key websites and apps to drive  personalised experiences, with a doubling of  recommendations modules across ABC digital  products. Notable enhancements include  an onboarding experience to the ABC Listen  app that provides content recommendations  to new users and introducing personalised  recommendations on the ‘Featured’ rail at the  top of the ABC iview homepage to better match  the ABC’s breadth of content to the interests  of our audience. Our ‘Future News’ initiative has been a 10-month  endeavour to uplift the ABC News web and  mobile apps into the modern era. This evolution  aims to appeal to a broader set of the Australian  public, allowing them to consume news in more  convenient, versatile and simple ways. The hero  colour of the ABC News logo has evolved  from black to blue and there is a much wider  range of other colours employed within the  digital experience. The ABC Archives team continues to provide  specialist services to our content makers in an  ever-changing media environment. In 2024, the  Archive hit a major milestone of over two million  digital audiovisual records available. 46  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 49 ===== Cybersecurity remains a top priority for us.  The ABC continues to invest in cybersecurity to  ensure the protection of its information assets  and that all ABC services are up to the latest  security standards. We remain vigilant and  closely monitor our technology environments  for cyber threats. Our Portfolio and Delivery Services (PDS) team  has been committed to improving the consistent  delivery of P&T projects while managing ongoing  demands. Key changes included improved  resource management practices, implementing  a transparent scheduling system to allocate  the right people to the right projects at the  right time, enabling P&T teams to work as one  synchronised delivery team. The past year has seen our staff go above  and beyond in their roles. For instance, when  delivering ABC’s Radio Australia FM services  to the Pacific, ABC staff constructed a new FM  transmit antenna from discarded materials  left on the island. This has strengthened  our partnership arrangement with Eco  Paradise Radio. Finally, we continue to prioritise accessibility  and the protection of vulnerable audiences.  We have implemented a range of industry- leading privacy measures to ensure that our  audience understands and can act on their  data and privacy rights. We also house parental  controls for children on our platforms, which  enables access to age-appropriate content. The past year has been one of significant  progress and innovation for the P&T team.  We look forward to continuing our work in  the coming year as we strive to support the  national public broadcaster’s mission to serve  all Australians.

More  than ever, audiences can connect with the ABC  when and how they prefer.  Backing up emergency  broadcasting  The Content and Distribution team has  deployed new monitoring technology to ensure  the delivery of vital emergency broadcasting  services whenever and wherever they are  needed. This important function for proactive  fault monitoring also improves content delivery. The teams in Technology Services and Master  Control Room (MCR) continue to replace  outmoded legacy hardware. This has greatly  reduced risks across all audio listening  platforms and improved business continuity  and resilience.  The MCR and Technology Services teams have  identified several transmission areas impacted  by extreme weather events, which have affected  audience coverage during the emergency  broadcasting season. These areas have been  prioritised for infrastructure upgrades that  will improve site resilience and personalised  content to the affected areas.  Facilities of the future The radio visualisation trial, which uses visual  AI technology to automatically create videos  from radio studio content, is now in operation  at the Brisbane studios and will be deployed  at the new Parramatta broadcast facilities.  The videos generated from radio studio content  will be repurposed for sharing on social media,  providing a wealth of additional content for  news streams across all platforms. The capabilities of Virtual and Augmented  Reality production are being explored for their  potential to provide more efficient use of studio  facilities, while delivering opportunities for  enhanced visual storytelling and audience  engagement. Several productions have been  completed utilising virtual elements and the  technology will be deployed permanently  into the new Parramatta studios as a pilot for  potential rollout to further sites. The Parramatta studio facilities will be  completed in 2024, with several already in  use for live programming. The facility utilises  the latest in IP technologies and will be the  ABC’s first fully augmented and virtual reality  television production facility. Technology  deployed at the site will be evaluated for  application in further facility upgrades  around the country. Personalising the audience’s  experience The past 12 months saw the ABC continue to  scale recommendations on key websites and  apps to drive personalised experiences. The use  of ABC recommendations modules increased  by 96% across websites and apps, with around  50 million recommendations delivered across  ABC digital properties increasing audience  content consumption.  Personalisation innovations include an  onboarding experience to the ABC Listen  app that provides content recommendations  to new users. Introducing personalised  recommendations on ABC iview’s ‘featured’  rail drove a 43% increase in content plays  and drove the audience to 388 unique series,  compared to 86 series accessed with manual  curation. ABC News launched a ‘News for You’  personalisation rail and a ‘Popular Now’ video  section which increased video performance  by 29%, and a ‘See More / See Less’ option  as the ABC’s first audience feedback loop  for personalisation.   49  ===== PAGE 52 ===== Future News Expanding the appeal of the ABC’s most visited  digital touchpoint, the ‘Future News’ initiative  has comprehensively updated the ABC News  web and mobile apps to allow Australians to  consume news in more convenient, versatile  and simple ways.  The most significant update to ABC News in  seven years encompasses a full rebrand across  all ABC News touchpoints. Audiences will  notice a single refreshed look and feel wherever  they engage with ABC News, whether that’s  broadcast, off-platform or on the ABC’s own  digital platforms.  Content is carefully curated to provide  something for everyone based on a broader  offering, providing opportunities for deeper  engagement with personal interests.  Personalisation elements have been enhanced  through the ‘For You’ content feature, which  packages stories into an interactive swipe  feed. This enables audiences to breeze across  headlines and dive deeper into stories, while  also consuming media such as vertical video  that’s delivered to suit personal tastes.  Archive digitisation  The ABC Archives team provides specialist  services to content makers in an ever-changing  media environment, enabling access to  valuable content and information resources.  A strong focus on innovation has encouraged  the team to adapt, embedding new tasks and  workflows. Quality Assurance teams now  manage content and metadata delivered to  archives via automation. Workflows for the  capture and description of ABC content assets  have been streamlined to enable the collection  of more raw media content, ensuring the ABC’s  content assets are protected and preserved for  future audiences.  CoDA (the ABC’s Digital Archive) continues to  be developed and integrated with production  and Media Asset Management systems,  facilitating more efficient movement of content  and metadata. In 2024, the Archive hit a major  milestone of over 2 million digital audiovisual  records available. This high value material is  now discoverable and accessible for content  makers through greater self-service and open  access. Access has been supported via a  program of CoDA Learning that coaches teams  on how to access the archive via their desktop.  This year saw the significant expansion of  CoDA Photos, which has seen News reporters  contributing still images and metadata at the  point of creation. Enriched metadata is key  to discoverability of content and pivotal to  enabling data driven workflows. Content makers  are now empowered to manage, discover and  share their still images across the organisation.  Cyber security The ABC closely monitors its technology  environments for cyber threats. Investment  has occurred in a range of tools, technology  and services to manage cyber risk. Actions  underway include the security monitoring of  systems; regular communications with the  Australian Cyber Security Center (ACSC);  maturing and expanding major incident  management response processes; enhancing  vulnerability management across devices,  operating systems and applications; and  ongoing staff awareness and training. 50  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 53 ===== Portfolio and Delivery Services Throughout 2023–24, the Portfolio and Delivery  Services (PDS) team has been committed  to improving the consistent delivery of P&T  projects while managing ongoing demands.  The team introduced transformative measures  to streamline project lifecycle management.

This content encourages international awareness of  Australia and Australian attitudes on world affairs and allows Australian  expatriates and travellers to keep in touch with affairs at home. ABC International is the pre-eminent Australian  source of independent news, information and  media support to the Indo-Pacific region and  to Australians across the globe. It conducts  its work through two distinct teams with  complementary objectives and activities:  ABC International Services (ABC IS) and  ABC International Development (ABC ID). The Federal Government provided an additional  $32 million over four years in the October 2022  budget for ABC International to expand content  production, transmission and media assistance.  In the May 2023 budget, the Federal Government  announced a further $8.5 million over four years  for regional transmission and distribution. ABC International Services The ABC International Services offers high- quality content on television, radio, and digital  and social media with a particular focus on the  Indo-Pacific region.  Over the year, ABC IS increased its broadcast  and digital presence along with its production  of bespoke programming for Indo-Pacific  audiences. This included extensive multi- platform coverage of major elections in India,  Indonesia and the Solomon Islands, and  coverage of regional events such as the 2023  Pacific Games in Honiara and the 2024 Festival  of Pacific Arts & Culture in Hawa’i. ABC Radio Australia ABC Radio Australia is an international radio  service now available via FM in 19 locations  in the Pacific and Timor-Leste and globally as  audio-on-demand and as an online stream.  Selected Pacific-focused content is also  available through syndication arrangements  with local and regional radio services across  the region. This year, ABC IS launched new ABC Radio  Australia 24-hour FM services in six strategic  locations: Palau, Nauru, Tuvalu, Pohnpei  (Federated States of Micronesia), Kokopo  (Papua New Guinea) and Gizo (Solomon Islands).  The ABC will deliver new services in a further  six locations in the second half of 2024.

ABC International 52  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 55 ===== ABC Australia ABC Australia is the ABC’s international  television service, available in high definition  via more than 100 rebroadcast partners  in 38 countries and territories across the  Indo‑Pacific region.  In 2023, ABC IS divided the previously single ABC  Australia broadcast service into two separate  schedules: one for the Pacific region and one for  Asia. This split allows ABC Australia to better  serve audiences with content and time slots  tailored to the respective regions. ABC Australia  then launched Kids Club, a brand-new lineup of  kids’ programming specially curated for Pacific  audiences, on its Pacific service. Over the year, ABC Australia delivered  programming of strategic importance to  Australia targeting Indo-Pacific audiences.  This included special editions of ABC favourites  Gardening Australia, Foreign Correspondent,  Compass, Backroads and Landline focusing  on the region, as well as the documentaries  The Cloud Under the Sea about undersea  telecommunications cables, Price of Progress:  Indonesia’s Nickel Rush, Running Dry on water  scarcity in Asia, and the two-part series  Project Wild.  ABC Australia’s flagship pan-Pacific current  affairs program The Pacific highlighted  significant stories of the year, including the  Solomon Islands elections and unrest in New  Caledonia. The Pacific utilises a network of  experienced local journalists across the Pacific  region who are funded by ABC IS but managed  by the ABC’s Asia Pacific Newsroom.  With major elections in Indonesia and India  in 2024, ABC Australia launched the limited  series Indonesia Decides and India Votes.  Created by ABC News’ Asia Pacific Newsroom  for international audiences, these series delved  into voter concerns and key political figures,  providing insights beyond the headlines. ABC Australia partnered with the National  Foundation for Australia-China Relations to  deliver the third edition of the annual Wang  Gungwu Lecture. This year’s lecture was held in  Parliament House in Canberra and delivered by  business leader Ming Long, the first Australian  woman of Chinese heritage to lead an  ASX200 company. Under a funding agreement with the Australian  Government’s PacificAus Sports program, ABC IS  produced and aired That Pacific Sports Show for  ABC Australia and radio show Fresh Off the Field  for ABC Radio Australia audiences.Photo shows three presenters from That Pacific Sports Show at an empty stadium.

We work to consistently  build the ABC’s brand, reputation and relevance  to all Australians through the use of data and  insights that in turn drive audience awareness  of the ABC’s priority brands, products  and programs.  A key way we listen to our audiences is through  the Audience Planning and Support team,  which receives over 128,000 direct contacts  a year. They ensure that the voices of ABC  audiences are used to drive enhancements and  improvements to our products and programs.  The collated data from these contacts and all  other ABC interactions is provided to producers  and content makers across the ABC through  interactive dashboards, to ensure they have  timely data to make good decisions.  Other initiatives to help ensure we are  engaging with our audiences in the way they  want across 2023–24 included ABC Shorts,  designed to increase ABC reach and value with  18–29s through fast scaling of resourcing and  experimentation on TikTok and other third-party  vertical video platforms. The successful project  ran from January to June and launched two new  TikTok accounts (ABC News and ABC Gamer)  and multiple genre verticals (science, weather,  lifestyle), as well as scaling existing presences,  amassing 130+ million views, 8.42+ million  engagements and 308K new followers.  To ensure we reach audiences on ABC’s digital  platforms we have been investing in building  awareness and understanding of ABC’s digital  products. This included a comprehensive brand  campaign for ABC iview across owned, earned  and paid media to place ABC iview as a top- of-mind entertainment destination. With many  Australians doing it tougher, and one quarter  of Australian households planning to cancel  their paid video subscriptions in the next three  months (Kantar: 2024), the campaign highlighted  ABC iview’s unique selling proposition as a free  and ad-free streaming service. With a new brand  platform ‘Always’, the campaign returned strong  performance outcomes for ABC iview, delivering  substantial growth and engagement. A key growth driver on ABC iview has been  Bluey. To reinforce the ABC as the home of  Bluey in Australia, marketing ran a 12-month  strategy to launch 11 new episodes, including  the premiere of ‘Cricket’, in partnership with the  SCG. The strategy involved creating Bluey Fest,  to celebrate five years of Bluey on the ABC, and  culminated in the Biggest Ever Bluey episode, a  28-minute special called ‘The Sign’. Bluey Fest  alone engaged millions of Australians, reaching  23.3M on social, as well as a whole of network  lift on broadcast, with 24-hour reach across all  four channels increasing by 16%. In addition to program initiatives, it’s important  that the ABC contributes to local communities.  A major initiative that brings this to life is the  ABC’s annual charity appeal, ABC Gives, which  this year united around a central theme of cost  of living. A day of giving across the country  raised over $1.6 million for those in need in  the lead up to the 2023 festive season. The  appeal supported a variety of Australian and  international organisations and aid agencies to  provide shelter, food, education, healthcare and  other forms of relief to those who need it most.  Charity partners included Vinnies, Anglicare,  Food Bank, the Salvation Army and Second Bite.Leisa Bacon 60  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 63 ===== To ensure we connect with all Australians  diversity has been a focus for the team. As talent  pipelines were limited in specific recruitment  areas, the team launched ABC Upstart, an  inclusive mentoring and training program  with a focus on diversity. The highly successful  six-week paid mentorship opportunity gave  selected interns a taste of working on dynamic  creative and marketing campaigns alongside  our internal teams, which has resulted in  engaging several of our Upstarts for longer  term projects.

People 18 – 75 years Combined reach The ABC’s combined national audience  reach across television, radio and online was  estimated to be 61.9% over a period of a week  in 20242, a decline of 3.5 percentage points  compared to the ABC’s net reach in 2023 (65.4%)3.  This overall decline was driven by softening of  broadcast TV reach and to a lesser extent, radio  reach. This decline in broadcast consumption  was partially offset by growth in ABC owned  digital and third-party platforms. ABC digital products  Total ABC Digital experienced declines in  2023–24, with weekly active users declining  by 5% on 2022–23 to an average of 12.4 million4.  Declines in weekly users year-on-year was  primarily driven by a loss in lighter audiences,  further fuelled by algorithmic changes to  search and social which has led to a decline in  referrals to news publishers at a market level5.  ABC News web has been the primary driver  of overall network decline with weekly users  averaging 7.0 million, down 9% year-on-year6.  In contrast, ABC News app weekly active users  increased by 1% year-on-year to 1.07 million7.  The ABC listen app saw year-on-year increases  in weekly active users in 2023–24, up 10% to  497,0008.

The ABC Principles set clear expectations about  working at the ABC as individuals, as leaders,  and together. The ABC Principles are:  •	 We are ABC  •	 Straight talking  •	 People focused  •	 Accountable  •	 Open and transparent. Over the last 12 months the ABC has undertaken  reviews of the workplace to ensure that the ABC  is a safe environment where employees feel  supported and respected. The ABC’s commitment to building a safer  workplace is evidenced in initiatives such as  the workplace culture survey undertaken in  the News division, which has identified areas  of improvement. As part of this commitment the ABC launched  the Report & Support Portal, a confidential  reporting platform that provides anyone who  has worked for or with the ABC an opportunity  to report an instance of bullying, harassment,  sexual harassment, discrimination or racism. Employee engagement  The ABC Employee Engagement Survey was  conducted in May 2024 and provided employees  with an opportunity to provide honest and  anonymous feedback about their experiences  working at the ABC. The ABC’s employee  engagement score for this year’s survey was  69%, which was lower than the score of the last  survey conducted in 2022 (73%). The Australian  benchmark is 76%. The results showed that ABC employees  are proud to work for the ABC and they  feel supported and respected at work.  It also identified opportunities for  improvement, including the better sharing  of information across the ABC and greater  support to be provided for adapting to  organisational changes.  The ABC’s Leadership Team and their  divisional executives have been briefed on  the engagement survey results and have  commenced work on developing action plans  to identify and implement initiatives in the  year ahead. Workplace flexibility Workplace flexibility remained a strong focus  for the ABC in 2023–24, with the hybrid working  model introduced in 2022 continuing to provide  ABC staff with the opportunity to mix time  worked onsite with working from home. A survey  was conducted with ABC staff in late 2023  to gauge the success of this model and the  outcomes informed a review of the guidelines  in early 2024. No significant changes were made  to the guidelines as a result of this review. The focus on online and virtual training adopted  during the COVID-19 pandemic continued  into 2023–24, representing 98.6% of the total  completions for the year, and 90.4% of total  hours. The key driver for keeping this focus is  to ensure ease of access to learning for all  ABC staff, regardless of their location or mode  of work. In 2023–24 the ABC continued to support  its leaders to effectively manage staff in a  hybrid working environment. A particular  focus was ensuring ABC managers were able  to constructively manage the mental health  of their teams, with 72 leaders participating  in specialist training provided by the ABC’s  EAP provider.  ABC people   85  ===== PAGE 88 ===== 2023–24 saw strong growth in learning and development activity across  the organisation. There were 71,611 learning completions recorded during  the year across over 300 different courses, representing a 30% increase  in overall completions from the previous year. The vast majority (89.5%) of  this learning was delivered via eLearning, with the remaining 10.5% made  up of learning facilitated virtually via Zoom/Teams (9.1%) and face-to-face  facilitated sessions (1.4%) In total, ABC staff participated in 37,427 hours  of learning. Completion of online eLearning  represented 45.3% of these hours, with the  remainder spread across virtually facilitated  sessions (45.1%) and face to face training (9.6%). The ABC continued its commitment to expand  the range of training on offer to staff during  2023–24, with 71 new courses added, covering  areas such as change management, solutions  journalism, sub-editing and neurodiversity  at work. Technological change 2023–24 saw a significant amount of  technological change which required the  support of training. The biggest of these  changes was the introduction of a new rostering  platform, People Hub Workforce. Training  was provided to all ABC staff to support the  effective implementation of this new platform,  with training spread across 12 separate courses  offered through a combination of eLearning and  virtual facilitation. More than 5,700 hours of  training were recorded as part of implementing  this change. The opening of the new Parramatta site was  also supported through the delivery of training,  with new courses designed to allow teams to  smoothly transition to the new workplace and  the new technologies within it. Training continued to be provided to support  staff through changes related to Core Media  and the corporate digital archive (CoDA). Editorial standards Learning in relation to editorial standards  continued to be an important focus of 2023–24.  Across the year there were 573 completions  of the online introduction to editorial policies  course, which is a requirement for all new  content makers within the ABC. On top of this  foundational learning, the Editorial Policy team  facilitated workshops with ABC staff across  important areas such as harm and offence,  social media and working with children.  These workshops provided critical ongoing  learning for existing ABC staff, ensuring that  they were clear in the application of the ABC’s  editorial standards and their understanding  of the editorial decision-making process.  There were 601 completions recorded for this  additional training, representing 632 hours of  training in total.  2023–24 also saw a renewed focus on expanding  the suite of learning available to staff in relation  to editorial standards, with work currently  underway between the Editorial Policy and  Learning Teams to review and enhance learning  options for staff in 2024–25 and beyond. Capability, development  and training  86  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 89 ===== Bullying, harassment  and discrimination  Bullying, harassment and discrimination  remained a focus area for learning in 2023–24,  with all new employees required to complete  learning in these areas. This mandatory training  is further supplemented with additional courses  to target specific needs within the organisation.  Topics covered by the different courses on  offer includes:  •	 Bullying and harassment  •	 Indigenous cultural awareness  •	 Disability awareness  •	 LGBTQIA+ awareness  •	 Building a culture of inclusion  •	 The ABC grievance process •	 Social media self-defence In 2023–24 a total of 5,223 hours of learning  related to these topics was delivered, with  a total of 8,045 completions recorded for  the period. Targeted leadership The ABC continued to invest in its leaders,  providing structured leadership development  training across its three core leadership  programs: Accelerate Your Leadership, Activate  Your Leadership and the Emerging Leaders  program. In total, 125 people completed these  programs in 2023–24. Leadership development  was further supplemented with the provision of  targeted courses focussed on key topics such  as leading an inclusive culture and disability  affirming leadership. During 2023–24 this  supplementary training represented 1,390 hours  of training and saw 683 completions recorded. Staff support The ABC’s Employee Assistance Program  provides employees with access to a range of  services through Converge International to  assist with issues that arise in their personal  and professional life.  ABC employees have access to confidential  short-term counselling for a broad range of  personal and work-related issues, including  career development, strategies to deal with  difficult workplace situations and coaching for  managers. The Employee Assistance Program  also provides helplines that employees and  their family can access for specialist advice on  issues such as domestic and family violence  and eldercare. Where an employee is made redundant, they  have access to career transition support from  an external provider.    87  ===== PAGE 90 ===== The ABC has a responsibility to reflect and represent the rich diversity  of Australia and its many communities. To achieve this, the ABC needs a  workforce with broad perspectives, backgrounds and approaches to create  a strong and diverse public broadcaster.  Commitment to diversity The Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Plan (DIB  Plan) came into effect on 1 July 2023 and will run  until 30 June 2026. It puts diversity, inclusion and  belonging at the heart of ABC operations. A key priority in the DIB Plan was to appoint  Cultural Advisor roles in the News and Content  divisions. The Cultural Advisors will ensure the  ABC better reflects social and cultural diversity  in the workplace and make its content more  accessible to more Australians. The remit of the  roles is to provide advice and support across  the divisions around Indigenous and diverse  cultural issues, protocols and opportunities. The ABC reaffirmed its commitment to equality,  taking home a Gold Employer Award at the  Australian Workplace Equality Index (AWEI) for  the third year in a row. The AWEI is a national  benchmark for LGBTQ+ workplace inclusion  across Australia. Maintaining gold status is  testament to ABC Pride’s ongoing support of  better, safer and more inclusive spaces where  every individual feels empowered to bring their  whole selves to work. The ABC was again recognised within the  top 10 of the Australian Disability Network  (ADN) Access and Inclusion Index, finishing  in sixth place. The ADN is an employer-led  national not-for-profit that helps organisations  improve workplace accessibility and inclusion.  The ABC participates in the Access and  Inclusion Index annually, which benchmarks  its journey to become more accessible and  inclusive of people with disability against other  participating organisations. Diversity & Inclusion  Standing Committee The Diversity & Inclusion Standing Committee  (DISC) is a body of diversity leads who represent  the ABC’s divisions, employee network groups  and Bonner Committee.  The DISC leads the implementation and review  of the ABC’s Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging  Plan and ensures that divisional strategies  align to the Plan. It also supports divisions to  implement the ABC’s Reconciliation Action  Plan (RAP).  Members of the DISC champion employee  network groups, role-model inclusion, and  escalate diversity and inclusion concerns to  the ABC Leadership Team where appropriate.  Diversity and inclusion 88  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 91 ===== Indigenous employment The ABC has several Indigenous-led bodies  that help inform ABC activities around First  Nations content:  •	 The Bonner Committee is the ABC’s peak  Indigenous reference group and ensures  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  perspectives are included in ABC strategic  and broadcast initiatives.  •	 ABC Mob is the ABC Indigenous employee  network group, established and led by  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander  employees to provide a gathering place for  Indigenous employees to share knowledge,  stories and connections.  •	 The ABC Indigenous Senior Leadership Group  (ISLG) brings together Indigenous senior  managers and editorial leads across the ABC  to coordinate and ensure best practice in all  Indigenous-led initiatives.  Creating opportunities for Aboriginal and  Torres Strait Islander voices, perspectives and  stories to be heard is a vital part of the ABC’s  role in fostering the national conversation  and in reflecting the cultural diversity and  national identity of Australia. The ABC aims  to demonstrate best practice in its content  development and delivery that provides an  example to the wider Australian media industry.  The ABC’s 2024–2027 Reconciliation Action Plan  aims to ensure the proportion of Indigenous  employees at the ABC is at least 3.4%, with a  focus on a 3% representation in content-making,  editorial decision-making, management roles  and Senior Executive level.  The Plan also has actions to maximise the  retention of Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander employees so it is in line with the  overall ABC workforce and to increase the rate  of conversion of trainee, cadet and intern roles  into ongoing positions to at least 50%.  Gender profile The ABC established a Gender Equity Network in  2023 as a priority in the ABC Diversity, Inclusion  & Belonging Plan 2023–2026. The ABC Gender  Equity Network champions inclusive practices  for feminine identifying, presenting and  perceived (FIPP) employees.  The ABC has had a strong focus on gender  equity and inclusion issues. Current workforce  data shows 55.1% of ABC executives are women.  The ABC continues to be a member of the  Champions of Change Coalition. Gender pay equity  The ABC is committed to paying employees  equitably and fairly. A gender pay equity  analysis was conducted to identify and address  any significant pay gaps across the workforce.  When looking at the gender pay gap based on  average total earnings, the organisation wide  pay gap is 7.0%. In relation to average total fixed  pay the gap is 4.9%. Average total earnings  were calculated in line with the Workplace  Gender Equality Agency methodology for total  earnings and included all earnings (other than  termination payments) and superannuation  payments. For example, shift related  allowances, shift penalties and overtime were  included. Average total fixed pay was calculated  based on the total of fixed base salary, fixed  allowances, fixed loadings and superannuation. The pay gaps calculated are not a direct  comparison of like roles. Instead, they show the  difference between the average pay between  men and women across the organisation.  The ABC has a gender pay gap due to the higher  representation of women than men in its lower- paid bands, higher average penalty payments  to men than women, and higher payments of  overtime to men than women.   89  ===== PAGE 92 ===== Accessibility The ABC publishes accessible news, current  affairs, lifestyle and entertainment media so  all Australians can read, listen to and watch  its products, services and content, including  the 21.4% of Australians who report having  a disability. The ABC’s accessibility specialists collaborate  closely with digital web and mobile app teams  to design and build flexible, broadly usable  products. The work done in previous years on  ABC Digital Products has put the organisation  in a position of high maturity for meeting  industry‑leading accessibility standards.  Accessibility projects in the past year have  included the rebuild of the ABC iview app  for Android TV, the pilot release of a podcast  transcript production engine to textualise audio  content for audiences who are deaf or hard  of hearing, and a complete refresh of the ABC  News website. Accessibility is now an essential part of  how the ABC designs and develops product  experiences, including:  •	 structure and layout of screen designs •	 inclusion of transcription and captions •	 continually reviewing using tools for visual  and hearing impaired audience The results are award-winning and accessible  digital products like ABC NEWS, ABC listen, ABC  iview and other apps and websites. A highlight  from the past year was the extension of audio  descriptions to ABC iview so audiences who are  blind or have low vision can enjoy their favourite  ABC shows on-demand. ABC Community  Network Groups  ABC Mob provides a gathering place for ABC  Indigenous employees to yarn and support  each other, with an ongoing commitment to the  Elevate RAP, DIB plan and ABC values.  ABC Gender Equity Network is an employee  network group focused on gender equity and  inclusion. Its mission is to raise awareness of  gendered barriers, stereotypes and stigmas in  the workplace and create meaningful solutions  inclusive of diverse needs. Membership to  the ABC Gender Equity Network is open to all  ABC employees.  ABC Belong is an employee network group that  supports culturally and linguistically diverse  (CALD) staff and their allies. It aims to increase  awareness and representation of cultural and  linguistic diversity in ABC people and content  and providing a space for the CALD community  and their allies to meet and support one  another.  ABC Inclusive is an employee-led group  committed to creating an ABC for all, through an  inclusive and accessible work environment by  providing education, awareness and support for  all staff but especially those with disability.  ABC Pride is committed to LGBTQIA+ diversity  and inclusion. It provides a community for all  employees of diverse sexualities and gender  identities, and those with intersex variations.  90  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 93 ===== Management of WHS Over the last financial year, digital workplace  inspection forms have been rolled out across  the ABC. The new forms enable efficient  inspection recording and reporting, as well  as the capability to create, track and review  corrective actions. The enhanced process will  promote more effective compliance monitoring  and a safer workplace. The ABC has also introduced a manual  handling eLearning package to reduce the  risks associated with manual tasks, which are  a leading cause of injuries. Training provided  A comprehensive range of training programs  were provided in 2023–24 to effectively manage  and reduce WHS risks.

Comcare  issued an Inspection Report on 1 August  2023, with findings of no non-compliance  with the WHS Act and Work Health and  Safety Regulations 2011 (WHS Regulations)  identified with respect to the scope of the  inspection. •	 On 17 October 2023, Comcare commenced a  proactive work health and safety inspection  at Ultimo as part of Comcare’s Regional  Engagement Program, focusing on the ABC’s  WHS Incident management processes.  Comcare issued its findings on 10 November  2023 with findings of no non-compliance with  the WHS Act and WHS Regulations identified  with respect to the scope of the inspection,  and noting “that the ABC has a robust and  proactive approach to safety that goes  beyond mere compliance with the WHS Act  and associated regulations.”  •	 Comcare was requested by the CPSU to  assist in resolving issues arising from the  restructure of the ABC’s archives and library  teams. On 19 August 2024, Comcare issued an  Inspection Report recommending the ABC  review its systems for managing change.  Comcare will conduct a follow-up review in  November 2024. 92  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 95 ===== Outstanding commitments as of  30 June 2024 The ABC had no outstanding commitments as  of 30 June 2024.  Claim statistics Of the 303 work-related incidents reported  in 2023–24, eight resulted in workers’  compensation claims being accepted  by Comcare to date. There were 11 claims  accepted for the 2022–23 year.  Analysis of the accepted claims in 2023–24  shows injuries/conditions were primarily due  to physical injuries including cumulative body  stress, vehicle accidents and mental stress in  the workplace or while working in the field. Workers’ compensation  premiums The ABC’s workers’ compensation premium for  the 2023–24 year was $3.97 million (ex GST).  Comcare has provided the ABC with a premium  calculation for the 2024–25 year of $1.80 million  (ex GST), a substantial reduction.  While the overall premium rate for all  Commonwealth Agencies has increased from  0.84% in 2023–24 to 0.95% in 2024–25, the ABC’s  prescribed premium rate for 2024–25 has  reduced from 0.79% to 0.58%. The decrease  is a result of the ABC’s achievements in  claims performance over the last four years  and reflects the effectiveness of the ABC’s  preventative and early intervention programs  in reducing the incidence and severity of  injuries and associated claims costs.

Robust practices were  implemented to support staff covering the  public debate and moderating the online  discussion.  Coverage of the Israel/Gaza conflict has also  presented a significant challenge for ABC staff  working online, arising from social media abuse  in relation to coverage, as well as the increased  risk of exposure to distressing material via  social media.  The risk to staff engaged in social media  content moderation continues to be a key  concern, particularly for Community Managers.  Regular group wellbeing checks have been  established for these staff. Safer Internet Day  2024 health promotion activities focused on the  challenges faced by moderators and recognised  the significant contribution they make to  ABC platforms.  The ABC has continued to refine its processes  and resources for managing risks in the  social media environment, including updated  guidance materials for responding to threats  of self-harm online, enhanced onboarding  materials and new self-care templates for  moderation staff and staff experiencing  online harm.  Training The ABC’s Social Media Wellbeing Advisor  provided 18 safety sessions to teams across  the organisation. These included team-specific  training, safety while moderating, safety  for vertical video presenters, and covering  the Referendum.  The advisor has also been working with the  Learning and Development team to update  Social Media Self Defence training and create  an e-learning module for managers. Trauma management Coverage of domestic and international events  such as the Voice Referendum, Greta bus  crash, Israel/Gaza conflict and Bondi Junction  massacre has posed significant challenges  over the past 12 months. In reporting these  stories, ABC staff across a variety of areas have  been exposed to distressing and potentially  traumatic content. Increased public scrutiny of  their work and, for some, a personal connection  to the events being covered escalated this risk.  Consistent with international best practice,  the ABC implements preventative and early  intervention strategies to minimise and manage  the impact of exposure to potentially traumatic  events and associated content. The success  of this intervention has been demonstrated  through significant reductions in mental  health stigma and an increase in staff seeking  early help.  Delivery of training and facilitated discussions  on the potential impact of this exposure,  including coping methods and support services,  have been an effective component of this  strategy. Over the past 12 months, the ABC’s  Manager Trauma Programs has delivered more  than 40 targeted psychoeducational sessions  to teams across the organisation. These have  addressed several areas of psychosocial  risks for the ABC, including trauma exposure  (whether direct, vicarious or secondary), moral  injury, international deployments, mental  health, suicide awareness and intervention,  burnout, bolstering stress tolerance and  psychological resilience, organisational change  and dealing with aggressive behaviours.  The ABC’s Trauma Intervention Program is  another effective way minimise and manage  the impact of exposure to potentially traumatic  content or events. The program involves the  provision of confidential, short-term treatment  by externally engaged psychologists who  specialise in trauma. Any employee impacted by  work-related exposure to traumatic events and/ or content can access this program.  94  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 97 ===== Enforceable undertaking In October 2023 the ABC finalised the  Enforceable Undertaking it entered with  the Fair Work Ombudsman in 2020 with the  implementation of People Hub Workforce.

Owned by Australians, it serves their  interest through the stories it tells that are  relevant and reflective of their lives.  Remaining Australia’s most trusted media  organisation is a goal we never take for granted. That trust is built on the organisation’s  commitment to meeting the highest standards  in its content; standards that are set out in  the ABC’s Editorial Policies and associated  guidance.  As the Editorial Policies state, “the trust and  respect of the community depend on the ABC’s  editorial independence and integrity”.  The ABC’s Editorial Policies team is the  custodian of these principles.  The team supports our content makers  and seeks to be a trusted, independent  and fearless voice within the ABC. It is  dedicated to maintaining editorial standards  and encouraging brave journalism and  integrity in content making that serves the  Australian community.  In addition, the team regularly reviews the  Editorial Policies, recognising that ABC content,  and the standards that underpin it, must  take into consideration changing community  standards and journalistic practice.  Editorial quality With that in mind, over the past 12 months the  ABC Editorial Policies team, with consultation  across the organisation and input from external  stakeholders, updated key standards including  impartiality and diversity of perspectives, fair  and honest dealing and the guidance on harm  and offence.  The changes to the impartiality standard, in  particular, ensure audiences continue to be  presented with a diversity of perspectives on  matters of contention within a reasonable  timeframe. This is an important strengthening of  the policy to ensure audiences have the relevant  information and perspectives they need to  make up their own minds about issues of the  day, particularly at a time where they are often  engaging with content across a multitude of  different sources and platforms.  Audience expectation also guided the  significant update to the ABC’s Code of Practice,  which was implemented in January.  The code is a public statement which distils the  ABC’s key editorial standards and is notified to  the Australian Communications and Media  Authority.  The updated code is more accessible, shorter and  more straightforward in its language and is, as it  states, a “promise to audiences of what they can  expect in the national public broadcaster”.  It also points out how to make a complaint about  ABC content. While we always want to avoid  mistakes, we recognise that they will happen, and  that the audience will want to have a say about it.  We welcome complaints as they are another way  to understand how Australians are engaging with  the ABC’s content and how we can do better. Gavin Fang 96  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 99 ===== Helping content makers equip themselves with  the skills to keep improving is another key goal  of the Editorial Policies team.  All ABC content makers must now complete  mandatory editorial skills training every year.  Those training sessions are a way to share  knowledge, hone editorial practices and give  content makers the confidence to be brave  in the pursuit of content that serves the  Australian community.  The media landscape continues to evolve  at a rapid rate and so does the ABC. But our  commitment to our core values is unwavering.  As an Editorial Policies team our focus will  continue to be on safeguarding trust in the ABC  and maintaining its reputation as a fearless and  independent public broadcaster.  ABC editorial policies The ABC Editorial Policies and associated  guidance outline the principles and set the  standards that govern ABC content. They are  a day-to-day reference point for content  makers and are critical to the ABC’s ability to  meet its statutory obligations and audience  expectations. They provide the basis for the  ABC Code of Practice, which the ABC provides  to the industry regulator, the Australian  Communications and Media Authority (ACMA).  In addition, the Editorial Policies give practical  shape to statutory obligations in the ABC Act,  in particular the obligations to provide service  of a high standard, maintain independence  and integrity, and ensure that the gathering  and presentation of news and information  is accurate and impartial according to the  recognised standards of objective journalism.  Editorial management and guidance  In 2023 the Editorial Policies team  conducted a review of selected provisions  of the ABC Editorial Policies, implementing a  recommendation of the Independent Review  of ABC Complaints Handling Procedures by  Professor John McMillan and Jim Carroll.  Six issues were in scope for the review:  impartiality; inclusion of enforceable complaint  handling provisions in the Code of Practice;  inclusion of reference to the PGPA Act in  the Editorial Policies and Code of Practice;  mandatory referral to ABC Legal in certain  fair and honest dealing cases; external  funding record keeping requirements; and the  reasonable efforts threshold for accuracy. The review commenced in March 2023 and  was conducted by the Editorial Policies team  in conjunction with the wider cross-divisional  Editorial Policies Group, reporting to the  Managing Director. The review outcomes were  presented to and accepted by the Board in  October. As a result, the following changes  were made to the ABC Editorial Policies on  13 December 2023: Impartiality standard 4.2 (diversity of  perspectives) was strengthened, imposing a  ‘reasonable timeframe’ test and an obligation to  aim to reach a similar audience when presenting  different perspectives across multiple items of  content. The revised standard states as follows: 	 4.2 Present a diversity of perspectives within  a reasonable timeframe, aiming to reach a  similar audience, so that no significant strand  of thought or belief within the community is  knowingly excluded or disproportionately  represented. Impartiality standard 4.3 (analysis and  commentary) was reworded to improve  clarity, acknowledging the role of analysis  and commentary in ABC content and ensuring  they are not presented as the ABC’s editorial  opinion. Part of the standard, setting out the  ABC’s commitment to fundamental democratic  principles, was moved into the ‘Principles’  section. The revised standard states as follows: 	 4.3 Take care in the presentation of analysis  and commentary. Do not present them as the  editorial opinion of the ABC.   97  ===== PAGE 100 ===== Fair and honest dealing standard 5.9 (mandatory  referrals for exceptional cases) was amended to  clarify when it is obligatory to seek advice from  ABC Legal prior to referring matters to senior  managers for approval. The revised standard  states as follows: 	 5.9 An appropriately senior ABC person  designated for the purpose must approve in  advance, having considered the applicable  editorial standards (such as 5.5, 5.7 or 5.8),  any proposal: 	 a to use secret recording during the  production of content commissioned,  produced or co-produced by the ABC; or 	 b to broadcast or publish material obtained  by deception; or 	 c to broadcast or publish without attribution  information that forms the basis of a report  and the ABC is to be committed to protect the  identity of the source of the information; or 	 d not to honour an assurance given in relation  to conditions of participation, use of content,  confidentiality or anonymity. 	 Advice must be sought from ABC Legal on  any proposal involving secret recording (5.9a)  or deception (5.9b). The following new or revised pieces of editorial  guidance were distributed to ABC content  makers in 2023–24: A new internal editorial guidance, ‘Using AI tools  in ABC content’ was written to provide content  makers with guidance on common questions  around new and emerging AI platforms and  services, including what usage was appropriate  in ABC content and when disclosure was  necessary.  A new internal editorial guidance, ‘Standards for  the use of third-party AI and protection of ABC  data’ was written by the ABC Digital Product  team. This note defines for all ABC workers the  terms under which third-party AI systems can  be utilised, and outlines the potential risks  associated with such use.  A revision to the guidance note Consulting  ABC Legal and Handling External Requests for  Access to Contentious Program Material sets  out several mandatory referral requirements for  content makers dealing with situations involving  legal risk. A new requirement was added for  situations where it is reasonably foreseeable  that a criminal offence may be witnessed by  ABC staff or contractors while researching or  creating content, or where footage or recordings  of criminal conduct are proposed to be included  in content. These matters must be referred to  appropriately senior managers, and advice must  be sought from ABC Legal. A revision to the guidance note Harm and  Offence included an expanded introduction  outlining the differences between harm  and offence concerns. It strengthened  considerations given to especially vulnerable  groups and gave more in-depth guidance on the  use of warnings and helplines. Editorial reviews The ABC consistently reviews its own  performance against the editorial standards.  Content makers and program teams regularly  review their own work, and the ABC also  commissions reviews that are independent of  content makers and carried out by a range of  internal and external reviewers.  The 2023–24 reviews and ABC responses to  those reviews are published on the ‘Editorial  reviews’ page of the ABC’s corporate website:  http://about.abc.net.au/howthe-abc-is-run/what- guides-us/abc-editorialstandards/editorial- reviews/. 98  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 101 ===== Corrections and clarifications  The ABC publishes a ‘Corrections and  clarifications’ page on its website (https:// www.abc.net.au/news/corrections) that lists  corrections and clarifications made to ABC  content across radio, television and digital  platforms, whether as a result of complaints  or for any other reason.  In 2023–24, 62 corrections or clarifications were  published on the ‘Corrections and clarifications’  page (there were 62 in 2022–23).  Where online transcripts existed, editor’s notes  and corrections to copy were also published.  ABC Code of Practice  A significant update to the ABC Code of Practice  came into effect on 1 January 2024.  The Code of Practice was rewritten to make  it more accessible and audience-friendly,  significantly reducing its length and complexity.  An audience-facing distillation of the ABC’s key  editorial standards, it serves as a prominent  public statement that reflects and enhances the  high level of trust audiences place in the ABC. Guidelines for the classification of television  programs remain in the Code of Practice,  setting out what is acceptable within each  classification. Procedural classification rules  and time zone charts have been removed. The standards in the Code of Practice are notified  to the Australian Communications and Media  Authority, while the full suite of more detailed  editorial and classification standards remain  available in the Editorial Policies, enforceable by  the ABC Ombudsman. Election Coverage Review  Committee The Election Coverage Review Committee was  convened for the Tasmanian State Election  in March 2024. Additionally, a Referendum  Coverage Review Committee (RCRC) was  convened in July 2023 to monitor coverage of  the Voice to Parliament Referendum. The RCRC  released a report containing analysis and  reflections on the coverage as well as the  Isentia share of Voice analysis covering the full  campaign period (30 August to 14 October).  The report was published on the ABC website on  13 November 2023.   99  ===== PAGE 102 ===== Infrastructure The Sydney Accommodation Project is a key part of the ABC’s Five‑Year Plan. The Project involves the move of approximately  300 staff to a new facility in Parramatta, and the  refurbishment of approximately 16,000 square  metres in the Ultimo building to contemporary  office standards supporting a flexible  work environment. ABC Parramatta, located across two floors at  6–8 Parramatta Square, includes purpose-built  broadcasting facilities for TV and radio and  supporting office space in the heart of Western  Sydney. Since receiving the approval from the  Public Works Committee in December 2022,  works have progressed with the Parramatta  facility opened and broadcasting commenced  in April 2024. By July 2024, three stages of the  Ultimo refurbishment were complete and the  fourth and final fifth stage works commenced.  Over 1,150 staff have been relocated around the  Ultimo facility and out to Parramatta to support  the works. Works are due to be completed in  Ultimo in late 2024.  The refurbishment of Ultimo and the relocation  of staff to Parramatta will allow for the  consolidation of ABC staff into a reduced  footprint within Ultimo, allowing for the gradual  leasing of up to seven floors. The revenue from  this leasing is expected to cover the ongoing  occupancy costs at Parramatta at no additional  cost to taxpayers. The commercialisation of the  Ultimo floors is progressing well, with tenants  commencing their occupation from January 2024  and further anticipated tenants joining later this  calendar year. 100  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 103 ===== Corporate services Audience  The Audiences team is responsible for ensuring  that Australian audiences are at the heart of the  ABC’s decision making. It works to consistently  build the ABC brand, reputation and relevance  to all Australians through the use of audience  feedback, data and insights. The Audience Planning and Support team  receives over 128,000 direct contacts a year, which  helps ensure that the voices of ABC audience  members are used to drive enhancements  and improvements to products and programs.  The collated data from these contacts and all  other ABC interactions is provided to producers  and content makers across the ABC through  interactive dashboards, to ensure they have  timely data to aid decision making.  ABC Shorts The ABC Shorts initiative was designed to  increase ABC reach and value with audiences  aged 18–29 by focusing on the fast scaling  of resourcing and experimentation on TikTok  and other third-party vertical video platforms.  The successful project ran from January to  June and launched two new TikTok accounts  (ABC News and ABC Gamer) and multiple  genre verticals (science, weather, lifestyle), as  well as scaling existing presences, amassing  130+ million views, 8.42+ million engagements  and 308,000 new followers.  To reach audiences on the ABC’s digital  platforms, the Audiences team has been  investing in building awareness and  understanding of the ABC’s digital products.  This included a comprehensive brand campaign  for ABC iview across owned, earned and paid  media to place ABC iview as a prominent  entertainment destination. The campaign  highlighted ABC iview’s unique selling  proposition as a free and ad-free streaming  service. With a new brand platform ‘Always’,  the campaign returned strong performance  outcomes for ABC iview, delivering substantial  growth and engagement. Bluey Fest To reinforce the ABC as the home of Bluey in  Australia, marketing ran a 12-month strategy to  launch 11 new episodes. The strategy involved  creating Bluey Fest, which celebrated five years  of Bluey on the ABC and culminated in the  Biggest Ever Bluey episode, a 28-minute special  ‘The Sign’. Bluey Fest alone engaged millions of  Australians, reaching 23.3M on social, as well  as a cross-network lift on broadcast, with 24- hour reach across all four channels increasing  by 16%.Photo shows people in life-sized Bluey and Bingo costumes waving at the camera from the grass at an empty SCG. Bingo and Bluey at the SCG.   101  ===== PAGE 104 ===== ABC Radio Gives 2023 The ABC’s annual charity appeal united around  the theme of cost of living. A day of giving across  the country raised more than $1.6 million for  those in need in the lead up to the 2023 festive  season. The appeal supported a variety of  Australian and international organisations and  aid agencies to provide shelter, food, education,  healthcare and other forms of relief to those  who need it most. Charity partners included  Vinnies, Anglicare, Food Bank, The Salvation  Army and Second Bite. ABC Upstart To overcome limited talent pipelines in specific  recruitment areas, the Audiences team  launched ABC Upstart, an inclusive mentoring  and training program with a focus on diversity.  The successful six-week paid mentorship  opportunity gave selected interns a taste of  working on dynamic creative and marketing  campaigns alongside ABC teams, which has  resulted in engaging several Upstarts for  longer term projects.  Strategy  The ABC Strategy division provides a range of  Corporation-wide functions. During 2023–24, the Corporate Strategy team  provided advice and contributed to strategic  thinking within the ABC, including developing  research papers and conducting policy  reviews. It prepared the ABC’s response to the  Government’s review of the independence,  funding and governance arrangements for  the national broadcasters. It also drafted  or contributed to a range of other ABC  submissions to government and parliamentary  inquiries, including on the creative and cultural  Industries, prominence and anti-siphoning  legislation, screen incentives reform, civics  education, options for combatting mis- and  disinformation, and the impact of social media.  The team developed the ABC Corporate Plan  2024–25. The ABC Education team oversees the ABC  Education portal, which provides teachers,  students and families with a range of  curriculum-linked educational media. For more  information, see page 38. The International Services team, comprising  ABC International Services and ABC  International Development, continued its work  to amplify the ABC’s position as the pre-eminent  Australian media organisation in the Indo- Pacific region and around the globe. For more  information, see page 52. ABC Corporate Affairs liaises with the  Government, members of Parliament,  Parliamentary Committees, the Department  of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional  Development, Communications and the  Arts, and relevant peak bodies in relation to  the corporation’s activities and priorities.  It responds to constituent inquires relayed  by members of Parliament and coordinates  stakeholder events, including the annual ABC  Showcase at Parliament House in Canberra. ABC Communications is responsible for  developing and implementing a proactive  communications strategy to encourage  audience engagement; providing  communications advice and support to the ABC  Board, Managing Director and Leadership Team;  advocating for the ABC and its content, strategy  and key messages with external media across  all platforms including social media. It protects  and promotes the ABC’s reputation, correcting  inaccuracies and ensuring Australians are  fully aware of its public position on key issues;  and ensures ABC staff are kept informed about  issues, changes, news and events via internal  communications channels. 102  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 105 ===== Legal services  In 2023–24, ABC Legal enabled the delivery of  the ABC’s services to its audiences through  the provision of a range of advice and  activities including:  •	 providing prepublication advice on breaking  news 24/7, investigations, podcasts and  general programming, together with  specialist legal briefings to content teams  •	 handling legal complaints, defending legal  claims, and managing other litigation,  including challenging suppression  order applications  •	 making and assisting with submissions  on law reform matters (see Appendix 10  on page 235 for a list of submissions)  and appearing at Parliamentary law  reform inquiries •	 providing advice on the regulatory framework  governing the ABC and its activities •	 managing FOI requests •	 providing legal advice around negotiation  and preparation of contracts relating to: 	– content acquisition, production  and distribution  	– technology 	– property sales, leasing, management  and maintenance 	– commercial matters which support all  aspects of the ABC’s operations •	 providing advice on intellectual property  including Indigenous Cultural and  Intellectual Property •	 supporting the management of the ABC  IP portfolio  •	 providing commercial law advice  •	 delivering privacy advice (see below) •	 providing rights management services  including a rights hotline service for  content makers •	 supporting the ABC’s international  operations •	 supporting major projects across the ABC •	 delivering training on a range of topics  including privacy, media law, and rights  management  •	 contributing to the strategic direction of the  ABC on issues such as AI and sustainability •	 deploying technology to automate  legal documents and processes  where appropriate.   103  ===== PAGE 106 ===== 104  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Responsibility In this section: Corporate responsibility 106 Environmental responsibility  109 Social responsibility  118 Jeremy Fernandez and Megan Burslem  at the Classic 100 Feel Good in Concert.   ===== PAGE 107 ===== Photo shows Jeremy Fernandez and Megan Burslem dressed in formal wear holding microphones and smiling.   105  ===== PAGE 108 ===== The ABC is committed to corporate responsibility and aims to deliver  content with integrity, diligence and transparency, and to act in the  interests of citizens. Delivering products and services that satisfy the needs  and expectations of audiences, and that meet the ABC’s editorial standards,  is the essence of the ABC’s existence.  The ABC is committed to fulfilling its corporate  objectives across all business and media  activities in a manner that is ethically and  financially responsible, and in particular  pursues environmentally and socially  responsible business practices. The values of  integrity, respect, collegiality and innovation  are the foundation of the ABC’s activities.  Reporting performance The ABC reports its corporate responsibility  and sustainability performance each financial  year in the Annual Report, with additional  information available in the Diversity and  Inclusion Report, and then throughout the  year on the Corporate Responsibility webpage  http://about.abc.net.au/how-the-abc-is-run/ whatguides-us/corporate-responsibility/.  Other than references to the ABC’s international  activities, the Annual Report is limited to  domestic operations within the direct control  of the ABC. Sustainability information about the  ABC’s investments in MediaHub Australia Pty  Limited, Freeview Australia Limited and National  DAB Licence Company Limited is not included  in the report. Any additional limitations to the  scope or completeness of particular data are  identified within the reported data. Stakeholder inclusiveness The ABC provides opportunities for its  audiences and other stakeholders to provide  input into its content and activities through the  ABC YourSpace audience community. The YourSpace community provides audiences  with opportunities to provide feedback on ABC  content through its Quality and Distinctiveness  studies, where members are asked regularly  to rate the content that have been watching,  reading or listening to. More ad-hoc and informal feedback is sought  through YourSpace and via survey links on the  ABC website and through ABC Social Channels  (Facebook, Twitter and Instagram).  In 2023–24, other mechanisms for engaging with  external stakeholders included: •	 formal audience contacts and complaints  processes – see p 134 and Appendix 4, p 218. •	 ABC Advisory Council processes – see p 126. •	 online feedback mechanisms specific to  ABC content areas, including survey links  through newsletters as well as website and  social channels. Corporate responsibility 106  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 109 ===== Protecting freedom  of expression Article 19 of the United Nations Universal  Declaration of Human Rights recognises  freedom of expression as a fundamental human  right. Freedom of expression is enshrined in  the ABC Editorial Policies.  The ABC’s commitment to impartiality  and diversity of perspectives reflects the  importance of diverse sources of reliable  information and a plurality of views within a  healthy democracy. In pursuing impartiality,  the ABC is guided by the following:  •	 a balance that follows the weight of evidence  •	 fair treatment  •	 open-mindedness  •	 opportunities over time for principal relevant  perspectives on matters of contention to  be expressed.  The ABC seeks to balance the public interest  in disclosure of information and freedom of  expression with respect for privacy.  Press freedom  The ABC’s commitment to public broadcasting,  public-interest journalism, and a strong media  culture to support Australian democracy  is unswerving and is a key part of the ABC  Five‑Year Plan.  The ABC is a founding member of the Global  Task Force for Public Media (GTF) and an active  participant in this key body, established in  2020 to defend the values and the interests of  public media.  The GTF offers an industry-led approach to key  issues affecting public broadcasters around  the world, a perspective that spans countries,  languages and cultures. It provides a way for  public broadcasters to support each other’s  work at a time when public broadcasting  and press freedom is under attack in so  many jurisdictions.  The GTF comprises the leaders of seven  major public media institutions: the ABC, ZDF  (Germany), France Télévisions (France), BBC  (United Kingdom), RNZ (New Zealand), SVT  (Sweden) and CBC/Radio-Canada (Canada).  The GTF is currently chaired by Catherine Tait,  President & CEO of CBC/Radio‑Canada. During the reporting period, the GTF issued  a statement condemning the destruction  of a television tower in Kharkiv, Ukraine in a  suspected Russian missile attack as an attempt  to silence news media and constrain public  access to vital news and information. The Corporation is also a member of the  Australia’s Right to Know, a coalition of  nearly 20 news and media organisations that  advocates for media freedom in Australia.  During the year, the ABC contributed to  a number of the group’s submissions on  law reform proposals with the potential to  restrict the ability of journalists and news  organisations to report (see page 235). Accessibility of content and services  A number of News teams participated in  podcast transcription this year through the  launch of ABC Transcribe. This started as a pilot  program that included News Daily and This  Week and was expanded to include AM, PM and  The World Today. To ensure all ABC transcripts  are consistent, an Enterprise Editorial Style  Guide of Transcripts was published. News has  seen an increase in weekly content transcription  from 100 minutes per week to 445 minutes  per week. The ABC continues to offer significant volumes  of content with closed captioning and audio  description across broadcast and ABC iview.  Audio description launched on ABC iview in  July 2023 and is available via iOS and Android  devices. Its ability to cast to big screens is a  significant step forward in making ABC iview  more accessible and inclusive. The volume  of content with AD on ABC iview at any given  time has more than doubled since launch, from  595 hours (9 July 2023) to over 1,200 hours (as of  16 June 2024).    107  ===== PAGE 110 ===== Protecting young or  vulnerable audiences ABC iview content, product and marketing  teams have worked to improve and promote  children’s subprofiles within ABC iview, ensuring  a dedicated and safe space for young audiences  within main ABC iview products and apps.  Content is filtered to the appropriate age group  based on preferences established in the initial  set-up by a parent or caregiver. These profiles  ensure that when a child logs into ABC iview  they are taken directly to a safe space that has  been editorially curated for their life stage. On June 3, ABC Kids and ABC TV Plus became  ABC Kids/Family, which has created a 24-hour  channel of content for pre-school aged children.  ABC Family on the ABC broadcast channel  and ABC iview offers viewers aged 7–12 and  their parents a range of programming that has  carefully selected for the age group to create  a positive shared experience. Significant care  has been taken in the gradual transition of  broadcast programming from the ABC Kids  preschool space into ABC Family. The ABC protects vulnerable Australians by  housing parental controls for children on  our platforms, which enables access to age- appropriate content. Digital literacy In a breakout year for artificial intelligence,  the ABC provided valuable context, analysis,  human stories and useful information to help  Australian audiences understand and navigate  the role of technology in their lives.  The ABC TV and ABC iview program WTFAQ was  responsible for one of the ABC’s top-viewed  social posts in the past year with their explainer  of the CAPTCHA test.  More in-depth coverage of AI was seen in ABC  RN’s six-part Science Friction series, ‘Hello AI  Overloads’, the Science unit’s critical coverage  of Dr Karl’s likeness being faked and used by  online scammers, The Law Report’s look at  potentially costly legal consequences of emoji  use based on recent cases involving harassment  and defamation, and Life Matters exploring how  to foster more intentional use of social media  and digital devices.  The Remote Media Literacy Program is a  partnership with the Australian Electoral  Commission that provides rural and remote high  school students with the skills to be critical  and confident consumers and producers of  media. During workshops with ABC journalists,  students learn how to critically engage with  the media as the fourth pillar of democracy,  tell fact from fiction in the news, reflect on their  own media use and understand the ways media  influences and impacts people and society. Privacy The ABC continues to implement a range of  industry leading privacy measures to ensure  that audiences understand and can act on their  data and privacy rights, such as simplified FAQs,  ease of access to the ABC’s privacy policy, and  efficient access to the ABC Audience Support  team. A range of privacy controls use simple  language within ABC Account settings. Editorial and broadcasting  responsibilities A culture of review is embedded across ABC  News teams. This involves bringing together a  group of people, including external voices, to  review the coverage of a particular news story  by a team or teams. The aim is to identify what  went well, what could have gone better and  what the team would do differently next time.  Recommendations then feed into planning  for future similar stories and are shared  across teams. 108  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 111 ===== As Australia’s national public broadcaster and most trusted media  organisation, the ABC has set the target of being net zero by 2030 for  greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated directly in its operations and  has submitted science‑based GHG emission reduction targets that support  the national transition to a low‑carbon economy. The ABC recognises this as part of its  responsibility to use resources as efficiently  as possible and for the benefit of the  Australian community. Informing and educating our audiences  about the natural world, our environment and  sustainable living has long been reflected in  ABC content. Official targets formalise action to  reduce energy use, travel and waste to landfill. ABC targets In 2023, the ABC Board formally set a target  to achieve net zero by 2030 for GHG emissions  generated directly in ABC operations – the fuels  burned and the energy purchased. These are  referred to as Scope 1 & 2 emissions. The ABC has also committed to setting a target  to reduce emissions generated indirectly  through its value chain — that is, emissions  from goods and services supplied to the ABC  to deliver its services. These are referred to as  Scope 3 emissions. The ABC has submitted near term science  based targets to the Science Based Targets  Initiative (SBTi) and is working through the  validation process. Sources of ABC emissions In 2023 the ABC worked with external  consultants to establish the emissions baseline  on which its SBTi targets will be based. ABC activity and spend data for FY22 was used  to calculate ABC emissions in accordance with  the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and  Reporting Standard and the Climate Active  Standard. The ABC’s estimated emissions  for FY22 are: SCOPE 1 Fuels the ABC burns 1,658 tCO2e, approximately 2% of total  emissions made up of the petrol and diesel  used in our vehicles, natural gas used for hot  water and heating in some locations and a  small amount of diesel oil used in emergency  back‑up generators. SCOPE 2 Power the ABC consumes 22,746 tCO2e, approximately 23% of total  emissions made up of electricity the ABC  purchases for use in 59 locations across every  State and Territory of Australia, including  offices, studios and data rooms. Environmental  responsibility    109  ===== PAGE 112 ===== SCOPE 3 Indirect activities 72,640 tCO2e, approximately 75% of total  emissions generated by upstream and  downstream activities from sources not  owned or controlled by the ABC. The ABC’s  emissions for FY24 have been calculated  in line with the Australian Public Service  Emissions Reporting Framework to ensure  consistent reporting of emissions by Australian  Public Service and Government entities.  The Framework does not include all the scope 3  emissions sources which form part of the FY22  emissions baseline outlined above. Hence the  reported FY24 emissions below is lower than  the FY22 emissions baseline. See below –  FY24 Emissions data.  Pathway and progress to reduction Scope 1 & 2 emissions The ABC’s five-step pathway to net zero by 2030 1 Improve energy efficiency in ABC offices and  studios around the country. 2 Generate renewable energy by installing solar  PV panels on suitable ABC properties. 3 Transition energy purchased to  renewable sources. 4 Replace the ABC fleet with lower emission  vehicles and fuels where operationally fit  for purpose. 5 Offset residual emissions that the ABC will do its  best to minimise. It intends to prioritise offsets  that benefit Australian communities. 110  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 113 ===== ABC progress Energy efficiency: over the last five years the  ABC has reduced its consumption of electricity  and natural gas by 19% measured in total  gigajoules (GJ). National Energy Consumption (GJ) Solar PV panels Starting in May 2023, solar panels have been  installed on 17 ABC properties, providing a  total installed capacity of 654 kW. Five of these  installations include battery storage. In FY24,  the ABC’s solar panels generated 646,050 kWh  (compared to 9,726 kWh in FY23), enough to  power 114 average sized Australian homes for  one year. Further solar installations are planned  for FY25.  The ABC’s scope 2 location-based emissions  have reduced by 9% year on year due to energy  efficiency measures, solar generation and  improving grid emissions factors. Further  details on the ABC’s FY24 emissions are  presented below. Renewable energy The ABC commenced purchasing GreenPower  electricity for the Ultimo buildings in November  2023. Purchases of GreenPower are the primary  reason for the 37% year on year reduction in  the ABC’s scope 2 market-based emissions.  Further details on the ABC’s FY24 emissions are  presented below. Fleet The ABC views every vehicle replacement  as an opportunity to improve the fleet’s  environmental profile by considering if there is  a need to replace the vehicle or whether there  is a lower emission alternative available that  meets operational requirements, while noting  that news gathering requires travel across  distances, particularly in regional areas. Hybrid and electric vehicles now make up 30%  of the ABC’s leased fleet, an increase from 24%  at the end of last financial year. More hybrid  and electric vehicles are on order, which will  increase hybrid and electric vehicles as a  proportion of total leased fleet to 36% once  delivered. Fuel consumption by ABC fleet  vehicles has reduced by 13% from FY23 to FY24  largely due to the improved fuel efficiency of  hybrid vehicles. The ABC took delivery of its first  leased battery Electric Vehicle (EV) in FY24 and  plans are in place to lease more EVs in FY25.  FY23 energy consumption has been adjusted  to include billing which was received after last  year’s annual report was prepared. The ABC has an ongoing program to enhance  energy efficiency across its buildings and  studios. This program includes upgrading  building management systems, installing  LED lighting, and replacing aging HVAC  systems, chillers, and boilers with more  energy-efficient units. In FY24, energy efficiency  initiatives included installing LED lighting  and motion sensors at sites in Darwin, Perth,  and regional sites in Victoria. HVAC systems  were upgraded in Darwin and regional sites  in NSW, Queensland, South Australia, and  Victoria. Additionally, the hot water and heating  systems in Ultimo were replaced with more  efficient units to reduce gas consumption.

Offsets for any residual  emissions will be considered as the 2030  target date approaches. Scope 3 Supplier emissions Over the year the ABC has continued to engage  with its suppliers to understand more about  their emissions, targets and decarbonisation  strategies. This information will help to  identify opportunities to work collaboratively  with suppliers to reduce emissions in  their operations. In June 2024 the ABC updated the Supplier Code  of Conduct to include additional expectations  of suppliers in relation to the environment.  The Code of Conduct is available for existing  and prospective suppliers on the ABC’s website. A significant source of scope 3 emissions  originates from the transmission of ABC  content from its city and regional locations.  The ABC transmission network provides  extensive coverage with 99.7% of the Australian  population having access to ABC analogue radio  services and 100% of the Australian population  having access to ABC digital television services. Other sources of emissions in the value chain  include content produced for the ABC and a  wide range of goods and services that support  its work including information technology,  property, travel, accommodation and  professional services, as well as waste from  operations, employee commuting and working  from home. The ABC has been working with industry  peers through Sustainable Screens  Australia (SSA) and Green Ears to champion  sustainable production practice and reduce  the environmental impact of the Australian  screen and audio industries. SSA has licensed  the internationally recognised ‘albert’ tool  that enables productions to measure their  environmental impact and develop a carbon  action plan and develop training for the  Australian screen industry. The ABC has  commissioned and broadcast several albert  certified programs including Tony Armstrong’s  Extraordinary Things, Grand Designs  Transformations and Restoration Australia. The  ABC is building internal capability to expand the  use of the albert tool. Waste The ABC continues to look for ways to minimise  and reduced waste to landfill. All capital cities  use a contracted waste provider who removes  waste, batteries and fluorescent tubes. ABC  offices contain collection points for mobile  phones and Planet Ark receptacles for printer  and toner cartridges. Major metropolitan sites  use multiple-bin waste systems to separate  waste streams. These include up to four bins  that collect organic, co-mingled, soft plastic  and landfill waste. In FY24 49% of waste  collected from major metropolitan sites was  diverted from landfill.  The ABC works with a specialist provider to  extend the life of Information Communication  Technology (ICT) equipment and reduce the  amount of waste to landfill. In FY24 23 tonnes of  end-of-life ABC ICT equipment was sent to the  provider who was able to harvest and recycle  13.7 tonnes of equipment.  The ABC has developed processes to donate  surplus and decommissioned equipment to  community organisations. Over the past year,  as part of the Sydney Accommodation Project,  we donated office furniture to community  radio stations and a local news organisation.  This initiative reduced waste sent to landfill,  extended the life of office furniture and  benefited community organisations. 112  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 115 ===== Photo shows ABC camera operator Jonny McNee with his equipment on a balcony against a bushland backdrop. Business travel The ABC will maintain its commitment to reduce  travel by non-content areas except where  business essential, acknowledging that the  nature of the Corporation’s business requires  its staff to travel around Australia and overseas  to gather news and create program content.  New emission categories for accommodation  and hire cars were added to the Australian  Public Service Emissions Reporting Framework  this year which will enable comparisons and  analysis of opportunities for improvement in  future years. FY24 emissions data APS Net Zero 2030 is the Government’s policy  for the Australian Public Service (APS) to  reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to  net zero by 2030, and transparently report  on its emissions. As part of the Net Zero in  Government Operations Strategy, non‑corporate  Commonwealth entities, corporate  Commonwealth entities and Commonwealth  companies are required to report on their  operational greenhouse gas emissions.  FY24 includes the addition of new emission  categories as required by the APS Net Zero  Emissions Reporting Framework: •	 refrigerants (reported as scope 1) •	 solid waste disposal and treatment  (reported as scope 3) •	 employee domestic business travel (hire car  and accommodation) (reported as scope 3). The Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory  presents greenhouse gas emissions over FY24.  Results are presented based on Carbon Dioxide  Equivalent (CO2-e) emissions and are based on  the best available data at the time of reporting.  Amendments to data may be required in future  reports.

Adjustments to the data may be required  in future reports. Not all waste data was available at the time  of the report and amendments to data may be  required in future reports. The quality of data  is expected to improve over time as emissions  reporting matures. Emissions from hire cars for 2023–24  have been sourced from third parties and  may be incomplete. The quality of data is  expected to improve over time as emissions  reporting matures. The ABC is reporting a small portion of  refrigerants that are outside of the scope  of the APS Net Zero Emissions Reporting  Framework for equipment below the thresholds  for inclusion. This approach has been taken to  report refrigerant emissions for all the ABC’s  large HVAC systems. Emissions from electricity consumed by electric  and plug-in hybrid vehicles has only been  reported for electricity directly purchased  by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.  Emissions associated with electricity  consumption from public charging stations has  not been reported for 2023–24. FY23 emissions were amended during the year  to include data which was unavailable at the  time that emissions were calculated in July and  August 2023.  Water consumption The ABC collects rainwater at 14 sites to a total  capacity of 270kL. Sustainability initiatives are  considered in any refurbishments undertaken.  This includes considering the viability of  rainwater collection among other initiatives. Heritage strategy The ABC has prepared a Heritage Strategy in  accordance with s. 341ZA of the Environmental  Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act  1999 (EPBC Act). The EPBC Act sets out the ABC’s  responsibilities to protect and conserve the  Commonwealth Heritage values of places that  it owns or controls. The strategy is intended  to inform the Environment Minister and the  Australian Heritage Council of the identification,  assessment and monitoring of those places. The ABC’s 2021–2024 Strategy https://about. abc.net.au/how-the-abc-is-run/what-guides-us/  heritagemanagement is available online.   115  ===== PAGE 118 ===== Managing emissions and climate-related risks Governance The People & Sustainability Committee assists  the ABC Board by reviewing and making  recommendations to the Board regarding  targets, policies and initiatives designed to  ensure the ABC’s impact on the environment  is minimised and monitoring progress and  reporting against targets. A corporation-wide approach is led by a  Sustainability Working Group comprising  senior representatives from ABC Divisions  responsible for identifying opportunities and  initiatives to reduce environmental impact and  managing implementation. Reports were provided to the People &  Sustainability Committee meetings in November  2023 and March 2024, to the ABC Audit & Risk  Committee in June 2024 and to the ABC Board  in August and November 2023. Reports covered  progress against initiatives to reduce emissions,  recommended science-based targets, and  developments in sustainability reporting. At its  November 2023 meeting, the Board approved  the ABC’s science-based targets. Strategy Reducing ABC’s impact on the environment  and achieving net zero emissions is a priority  of the ABC Board approved Five-Year Plan and  a Key Performance Indicator set out in the  ABC Corporate Plan 2024. Performance will be  reported through ongoing Annual Reports. Risk management In 2023 the ABC undertook an initial assessment  of climate risks and opportunities and  specifically considered: •	 the impact of increasingly severe weather  events on the ABC’s services, operations  and staff •	 the transition in the ABC’s operations to meet  publicly announced targets, Government  commitments and public expectations •	 the policy, regulatory and technological  changes associated with the transition to  a net zero emissions economy. This year the ABC has commenced work to  expand the initial climate risk assessment  in line with the guidance provided by the  Climate Risk and Opportunity Management  Program (CROMP) overseen by the Department  of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment  and Water (DCCEEW).  More information on the ABC’s climate risk  assessment will be provided in next year’s  annual report. 116  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 119 ===== Metrics and Targets ABC emissions for FY23 and FY24 have been  calculated in line with the APS Net Zero  Emissions Reporting Framework. The ABC has  achieved year on year reductions in scope 1  & 2 emissions measured using the location  and market-based approaches as illustrated  below. The market-based approach accounts  for the ABC’s GreenPower purchases and the  jurisdictional renewable power percentage  (ACT only). The reduction in the location-based emissions  is due to ABC energy efficiency and solar  generation initiatives offset by the inclusion of  refrigerant emissions in reporting for the first  time in FY24. The reduction in market-based  emissions is primarily due to the purchase  of GreenPower for the Ultimo buildings from  November 2023.

Social responsibility in  the community Community service announcements  The ABC’s Local Radio services broadcast  community service announcements (CSAs)  to assist and inform local communities. CSAs  are frequently run as part of emergency  broadcasting, focusing on preparation and  awareness before an event and providing  information after an event. CSAs are played in  Indigenous languages where appropriate.  Connecting with communities The past year saw the ABC revitalise the  Open House initiative with events in Brisbane,  Melbourne, Perth, Canberra and Hobart offering  guided tours of ABC studios and opportunities  for audiences to interact with key ABC  personalities. This initiative supports a key plank  of the Five-Year Plan in promoting transparency  and strengthening trust with audiences.  ABC Local Radio forged partnerships with  councils and community groups, embedding  its presence in local communities. ABC Radio  Melbourne collaborated with Deakin University  and the City of Greater Geelong to establish a  radio-in-residency on the Geelong Waterfront,  featuring live broadcasts, journalism  masterclasses and student internships.  Similarly, ABC Radio Brisbane partnered with  the City of Moreton Bay to create a pop-up  studio from the Visitor Information Centre  located at Redcliffe Jetty, sharing stories from  across the region.  ABC Radio Sydney engaged diverse  audiences through partnerships with  cultural organisations, broadcasting Thank  God It’s Friday! with Richard Glover live from  events such as the Sydney Writers’ Festival  in Parramatta, the Blue Mountains Writers’  Festival in Katoomba and the Sydney Comedy  Festival in Chatswood. Other examples of  outreach included Simon Marnie’s Weekend  Mornings program, which covered events  such as Bankstown Bites, Sculptures by the  Sea, Africultures, the National Indigenous Art  Fair and the Lunar New Year celebrations in  Cabramatta.  ABC Radio Canberra continued its Annual  Community Spirit Award in May, celebrating  local heroes at a special morning tea event.  Across regional Australia, ABC stations  strengthened relationships with communities  through outside broadcasts and local  initiatives. Projects like ‘Say G’Day’ in regional  Queensland encouraged community  engagement, while events such as the Great  Southern Breakfast outside broadcast in  Albany and the Wheatbelt road trip in Western  Australia celebrated local culture, traditions  and stories.  In October 2023, the ABC Central Victoria  team visited Rochester on the anniversary  of devastating floods, hosting a community- facing outside broadcast that highlighted  local concerns and featured the first regional  interview with Victoria’s new Premier. This  multi-platform coverage extended to events  such as the Port Fairy Folk Festival and Cresfest  in Creswick, showcasing regional voices and  stories across Australia.  Social responsibility  118  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 121 ===== International development  ABC International Development (ABC ID)  supports partner organisations in the  Indo‑Pacific to pursue quality journalism,  tell engaging stories and build strong  connections with their communities.

Either the ABC Chair or Managing  Director, or both, met with the Advisory Council  at each meeting. The Advisory Council also  participated in discussions with ABC executives  on a range of issues including the ABC Five‑Year  Plan, digital transformation, content and  commissioning, emergency broadcasting,  audience analytics and perceptions of the ABC,  ABC International Services, ABC Radio and a  Muster Dogs case study. Over the year, Council members were also asked  to engage with the following topics and to  canvass sentiment in their communities. •	 ABC Education: Members provided  feedback regarding the ABC Education and  educational content at the ABC, including:  definition of and expectation around  educational content; what educational  content is considered important and of use  to their communities; the role of the ABC in  a continuous learning space; importance of  media literacy and how the ABC can improve  its connection with educators, learners  and parents. •	 ABC social media platforms: Members  provided feedback on whether ABC  content on social media platforms such as  Facebook and Instagram, is representative  of community views of the ABC, the value  it brings and the kinds of content and  stories that are available. •	 ABC Monday evening schedule – flagship  programs: Members provided feedback  on ABC programs 7.30, Australian Story  and Four Corners, positives and negatives  around these programs, and if topics  Australians care about are being covered  in each program. •	 Trust in the ABC: Members provided feedback  regarding the ABC’s standing among  other media outlets as a trusted source of  information, which parts of the ABC are more  trusted than others, and how the level of  trust compares to previous years. Council recommendations The Council made the following  recommendations in 2023–24:  •	 Recommendation 1:  	 ABC Education 	 That the ABC produce more civics education  content: for example, how government works  and how policies are formulated.  	 That the ABC provide age guides for  programs and increase awareness of  ABC’s educational content among parents  and grandparents, especially those who  home school.  	 That the ABC continue to provide resources  for teachers as these are highly regarded  and utilised. 	 That the ABC, as a public broadcaster, should  produce more content on media literacy.  •	 Recommendation 2: 	 ABC social media platforms 	 In relation to the ABC Australia Facebook  page, the purpose of the page needs to be  clearer and with a more focussed approach  as to who the target audience is. •	 Recommendation 3: 	 ABC Monday evening schedule –  flagship programs 	 That the ABC continue to provide high- quality, in-depth journalism and storytelling  through the Monday evening flagship  programs, while continuing to look for  opportunities to showcase a diversity of  perspectives and experiences. This includes  ensuring a range of views are represented,  spotlighting stories from different parts of  Australia, and covering a breadth of topics. 	 That the ABC continues to explore ways  to enhance accessibility and the reach of  the programs, particularly among younger  audiences. This could include increased  use of digital and social platforms for  complementary content. 	 Overall, it would be great to acknowledge  that these programs showcase some of the  best of what the ABC offers. 130  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 133 ===== •	 Recommendation 4: 	 Trust in the ABC 	 That the ABC look for opportunities,  potentially as part of promotional  campaigns, to inform or remind Australians  of the role of the ABC and that the ABC is a  publicly funded broadcaster with a Charter  that requires it to maintain independence,  among other things. 	 That the ABC build on the relationship  between triple j presenters and the audience  by considering triple j talent for roles outside  triple j. This may attract a youth audience to  a broader range of programs. Youth Advisory Committee In 2024, the ABC Board established the  Youth Advisory Committee for the purpose  of providing a youth perspective on matters  being considered by the Advisory Council.

New technologies and digital  platforms continue to disrupt audience behaviours and media distribution  channels. As a vital national and cultural institution, the ABC will adapt and  innovate in response to the changing needs of the Australian public.  The Board recognises that risk management and  internal compliance and controls are vital to  effective governance. The ABC’s Board-approved  risk appetite statements align to the ABC’s  strategy, operational environment and purpose,  while the ABC’s Risk Management Policy and  Resilience Policy set the foundations for the  ABC’s risk management framework.  The ABC has embedded the risk management  framework across the organisation. Risk  management features in all the ABC’s critical  activities, while a practical and straightforward  risk management process is used to identify,  assess, manage and monitor significant risks.  As the ABC’s risks are becoming increasingly  interconnected and complex, the risk  management approach is regularly reviewed,  assessed and, where necessary, adjusted  with teams and through the appropriate  governance forums.  In 2023–24, the Leadership Team regularly  reviewed the ABC’s risk profile and received risk  management reports and resilience information.  Risk reports considered the ABC’s people,  audience, reputation, financial, technology,  legal and compliance exposures. There was  sustained pressure in risks associated with  the extraordinary pace and extent of change  in the media landscape throughout the year.  The ABC continued to monitor the evolving  threats and assessed opportunities, refining  its approach and developing organisational  responses. The climate risk profile was matured  during the year, influencing the ABC’s approach  to sustainability and prioritisation of activities  that underpin its action plan.  The Audit & Risk Committee maintained  oversight of the ABC’s risk management  framework and risk profile. The Committee  regularly reviews the ABC’s risk profile,  including the emerging issues and trends and  the current operating position against the  ABC’s appetite for risk. It annually reviews and  recommends the ABC risk profile and appetite  statements to the Board for approval.  Insurance The ABC has acquired appropriate insurances  from Comcover, including directors’ and officers’  liability insurance. The 2023–24 premium for  directors’ and officers’ liability insurance was  $277,493. The ABC has indemnified each Board  member for legal costs and liabilities incurred  in their capacity as a Board member of the ABC  under a Deed of Access and Indemnity. Board  members were permitted to vote on the Deed  pursuant to a declaration by the Minister for  Communications under s. 15 of the PGPA Act.  132  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 135 ===== Audit Privacy Group Audit plays a key role within the ABC’s  governance framework. It reports independently  to the Audit & Risk Committee and contributes  to the achievement of the ABC’s goals and  objectives by:  •	 providing objective assurance of the design  and operation of the ABC’s internal controls,  including recommending improvements  to management  •	 promoting a culture of accountability  and integrity  •	 conducting investigations in relation to fraud  or public interest disclosure allegations  •	 responding to the ABC’s changing  requirements and applying a continuous  improvement mindset, including using  technology and data to assess internal  control performance.  Group Audit prepares and delivers the ABC’s  Internal Audit Plan, which is approved by the  Audit & Risk Committee. A risk-based audit  approach is adopted to ensure focus on the  ABC’s key strategic objectives and operational  areas. Group Audit works closely with Risk to  ensure that all aspects of risk are considered  in the development of the Internal Audit Plan,  including operational, strategic, people and  financial risk.  Audits are conducted in accordance with  international auditing standards. In 2023–24,  Group Audit completed 20 audit assignments  (26 assignments were completed in 2022–23),  covering editorial, content delivery, operational,  finance, information technology, risk  management, people and culture, health and  safety, and project management processes.  Group Audit uses employees and external  partners to deliver the Internal Audit Plan.  External partners provide expertise in specialist  areas, supplementing internal resources and  experience. Group Audit liaises with the ABC’s  external auditors, the Australian National Audit  Office, and their nominated representative,  KPMG. This includes seeking advice on proposed  areas of focus and ensuring minimal duplication  of audit coverage.  A full report on the activities of the Audit & Risk  Committee is provided on pp. 212–213.  The ABC Privacy Team advises on initiatives that  use personal information and delivers the ABC’s  Privacy Management Plan. During 2023–2024  the ABC Privacy Team: •	 delivered privacy refresher training to  staff who handle personal information as  part of their roles, which will conclude in  early 2024–2025 •	 supported Privacy Awareness Week by  conducting a range of activities to raise  privacy awareness and promote best  practice across the Corporation, including: 	– hosting a cross-divisional privacy panel  event on Accountability, Transparency  and Security 	– surveying ABC staff on their attitudes  toward privacy 	– providing an update on children’s  privacy from the Child Safety and  Wellbeing Advocate •	 reviewed and refined the Data Breach  Response Plan •	 participated in a cyber security incident  simulation exercise that included a data  breach scenario to enhance executive  leadership preparedness •	 reviewed and updated its privacy collection  notices and reviewed the data collection  processes for user generated responses. Data breach notification  Data breach notification laws make it  mandatory for the ABC to report a data breach  that is likely to result in serious harm to any  affected individuals. Notification must be  made to the affected individuals and the  regulator. In 2023–2024, the ABC did not  experience any data breaches that required  notification to the Office of the Australian  Information Commissioner.   133  ===== PAGE 136 ===== ABC Ombudsman –  Content complaints Ombudsman’s overview –  Fiona Cameron  As a public broadcaster the ABC sets itself  particularly high standards. For an organisation  that holds others to account, it is critical that  the ABC has mechanisms to hold itself to  account. Audience complaints play a vital role  in this regard and the Ombudsman’s Office  provides a link between audiences and content  makers to keep the spotlight on key standards  including independence, integrity, impartiality  and accuracy.  The ABC received 24,700 written complaints  in the 2023–24 financial year. The vast majority  were general complaints about matters  of personal taste or preference including  complaints about program scheduling. 7,041  complaints (raising 8,394 issues) related to  specific ABC content and concerned the ABC  editorial standards and are the focus of the  Ombudsman’s Office. Content complaints for the  year are at a five-year high, largely attributable  (49%) to the Israel/Gaza war (the war).  While reporting from an international warzone  on developing situations is challenging, the  Ombudsman has found the ABC’s coverage to  be professional, wide-ranging and reflective  of newsworthy events.  While complaint numbers are a useful  reflection of audience engagement, often  content that is uncomfortable attracts more  criticism. The ABC needs to be mindful of this  tension to avoid being fearful of delivering on  charter obligations to provide innovative and  comprehensive programming while being thick  skinned enough to clarify and explain decisions,  acknowledge misjudgements and, where  appropriate, apologise. Programs/Platforms most complained  about 2023–24  B ar  graph  show s pro grams  and  pla tfor ms most  com plai ned ab out to  the A BC  Ombu dsman  in 2 023 -24 .

Uncharacteristically, Q+A beat News online as  the number one complained about program  due to a campaign about a single episode  aired in late 2023 which dealt exclusively with  the war. Normally, News online comfortably  takes the lead given its broad remit and reach  and that the stories remain as a permanent  record designed to be shared across social  media. Predominantly, complaints were about  bias and inappropriate content (the war),  and factual accuracy. The trend in relation to  interview programs such as 7.30 suggest that  complaints come from audience members who  identify with the interviewee’s perspective.  This ignores the duty of the anchor to conduct a  testing interview and in the context of political  interviews, to get beyond the scripted ‘talking  points’ in what is a strictly time limited format. 134  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 137 ===== Ombudman’s Office  The inaugural Ombudsman, Fiona Cameron, has  been in the position since September 2022 and  has set up a new complaint handling framework  and a review mechanism for complainants who  remain unsatisfied. The Ombudsman reports  directly to the ABC Board and leads a small  team which is independent from the content  making areas of the ABC. At the core of the  establishment of the Ombudsman’s Office  is greater transparency, accountability and  visibility and all significant investigations are  published at https://www.abc.net.au/about/ ombudsman.  Written complaints about specific ABC  content broadcast or published by the  ABC and concerning the ABC’s editorial  standards, are considered content complaints.  Content complaints are generally referred  to the Ombudsman’s Office to assesses and  determine appropriate handling in accordance  with the ABC Complaint Handling Process.  The Ombudsman’s Office may investigate the  complaint and determine whether ABC editorial  standards have been met. In cases where the  ABC’s editorial standards have not been met,  the complaint will be upheld (either fully or in  part). Complaints can also be resolved where  appropriate action is taken to remedy a matter.  In many circumstances the Ombudsman’s  Office will refer the complaint to the content  area responsible allowing those with the most  direct knowledge and involvement in creating  content to respond. Complainants who remain  dissatisfied with an ABC response can seek a  review from the Ombudsman’s Office.  Content complaint handling  Complaints 2023–24 % 3 yr av  2021–23 % Total1 24,700 22,882 	 General 17,659 71% 19,572 86% 	 Content 7,041 29% 3,310 14% Content complaint  issues2 8,394   3,618 Investigated 5,014 60% 1,561 43% 	 Not upheld 4,532 90% 1,238 79% 	 Resolved 405 8% 239 15% 	 Upheld 77 2% 84 5% 1	 The number of single complaints (may contain more than one issue) 2	 The number of issues identified in content complaints Outcome of investigated complaints  During 2023–24, 8,394 content issues  were finalised by the Ombudsman’s Office.  This significant increase over the three-year  average was due to complaints related to the  Israel/Gaza war, which represented 49% of all  content issues. The Office investigated 5,014  issues, 56% of which related to Israel/Gaza.  A single episode of Q+A which dealt exclusively  with the war generated 1,974 complaint issues  as part of a coordinated campaign.  During the year, 10% of all content complaint  issues were resolved or upheld. The focus of  the Ombudsman’s Office is resolution rather  than ongoing investigation and in the reporting  period, 405 issues (8% of all investigated issues)  were resolved after the relevant content area  took prompt and appropriate action to remedy  the cause of the complaint. 77 issues (2% of  all investigated issues) were upheld in cases  where it was determined that ABC editorial  standards had not been met. These percentages  are lower than the three-year average due to  the sheer number of war-related issues that  were investigated, the overwhelming majority  of which (94%) were not upheld.   135  ===== PAGE 138 ===== The new Complaint Handling Process  introduced a mechanism where complainants  who are dissatisfied with a response from  the ABC may seek an Ombudsman Review.  In 2023–24, the Ombudsman’s Office finalised  147 such reviews. Most of these requests  were declined (108) as the Ombudsman  concurred with the response already provided.  39 requests were further considered.  Summaries of upheld and resolved complaints  are published at abc.net.au/about/ombudsman  as individual complaints are finalised,  providing timely access to complaint decisions.  Full reports of significant investigations are  published by the Ombudsman’s Office. Subject  to privacy considerations, all complaints that  are reviewed by the Ombudsman are also  published in full. More detailed analysis of  content complaints data is published in the  form of regular public reports.

Timeliness of investigated  complaints The Ombudsman’s Office seeks to respond to all  complaints as quickly as possible in accordance  with the ABC’s Complaint Handling Process.  In 2023/24, the average response time for  investigated complaints was 11 days.  Australian Communications  and Media Authority Members of the public who complain to the  ABC about matters covered by the ABC Code of  Practice and who are dissatisfied with the ABC’s  response, or who do not receive a response to  their complaint within 60 days, may seek review  from the Australian Communications and Media  Authority (ACMA). During 2023–24, the ACMA notified the ABC  that it commenced an investigation into one  matter. The ACMA did not finalise any ABC Code  investigations (compared to four in 2022–23).  Commonwealth Ombudsman  The Commonwealth Ombudsman notified the  ABC that it finalised one matter in which it  decided an investigation of the complaint was  not warranted in the circumstances. 136  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 139 ===== Photo shows Anthony Burke and Yasmine Ghoniem standing in the garden in front of an architecturally adventurous looking home made of corrugated iron.

In our opinion,  these annual performance statements are based on properly maintained records, accurately reflect  the performance of the entity, and comply with subsection 39(2) of the PGPA Act.  Purpose The ABC’s purpose is to fulfil its functions as set out in the ABC Act, particularly the ABC Charter. Audience Outcome: The ABC is valued The ABC’s purpose is to deliver valued services that reflect and contribute to Australian society,  culture and identity. ABC survey responses are used to track its Value score.

Perceptions of value of the ABC to the Australian community have remained stable at 81% across  2022–23 and 2023–24. Positively, value perceptions have improved among younger audiences aged under 35 years,  driven by improved perceptions among this age cohort that the ABC is producing and sharing content of an  educational nature, encouraging, and promoting Australian performing arts, and being distinctively Australian  and contributing to Australia’s national identity. Audience Outcome: Driving trust in the ABC The ABC is Australia’s most trusted media organisation and should maintain this position. ABC survey  responses are used to track its trust score.

Being a trusted source of news and information is important across all aspects of the ABC, and it  remains the most trusted media source in Australia. In 2023–24, 78% of Australians trusted the information  provided by the ABC – this is significantly higher than commercial TV (55%), commercial radio (59%) and  newspapers (59%). The ABC will continue to prioritise building understanding and, where appropriate, enhancing  the transparency of its efforts to ensure accurate and impartial journalism that the Australian public can trust.

The proportion of Australian adults who use more than one ABC platform is an important indicator  of engagement with the ABC. In 2023–24, just over half of all Australians (51%) used more than one ABC platform  per week. This is an increase from the 2022–23 result of 50%. This increase is most pronounced in the 30 to  49 age group.

Combined weekly reach shows the proportion of Australian adults that have accessed any ABC  content each week. In 2023–24, just under two-thirds of Australians watched, listened to, or read ABC content  in an average week (62%). When compared to the same metric last year (not reported in the APS as it is a new  measure this year), combined weekly reach declined from 66% in 2022–23. This decline is mainly driven by a drop  in broadcast TV reach, and to a lesser extent, radio reach. A proportion of this decline was offset by growth in ABC  owned digital channels and third-party digital platforms. Further growth in the ABC’s digital services remains a  strategic priority.

A drop in ABC News web7 users in the first half of the financial year resulted in lower active weekly  users. ABC News web continues to drive the largest audience volume so changes in its audience numbers  have a significant impact on overall network figures. ABC iview, ABC News and ABC Listen apps saw growth in  audience numbers. The ABC audience continues to peak around events (such as elections and Hottest 100) and  big content drivers (Bluey, breaking news events, and drama launches). However, the performance of temporary  event-driven peaks was not enough to offset ABC News web declines. Third-party algorithm changes have also  negatively impacted referrals to ABC News web articles. The ABC revamped its ABC News web offering in July  2024 to improve the audience experience. Investments have also been made to raise public awareness of ABC  digital services.

ABC iview (the only product with mandatory log-in) saw an increase  in users logging in, driven by strong children’s content and compelling content in drama and entertainment.  Ongoing efforts by the ABC to improve personalisation and user experience through the launch of the new ABC  News web layout will aim to further improve this measure in the upcoming financial year. The “Log in to Watch” strategy is a key approach to enable the organisation to provide our audiences with  personalisation within our apps and our one-to-one content discovery efforts. Over the course of the year the  organisation has updated a range of ABC iview app versions which now require our audience to log on; as well  as audience members upgrading with devices which results in a new version of the app being installed which  requires log on.  5	 This measure will be renamed in FY25’s Corporate Plan and APS to “Weekly active users across owned ABC digital platforms” 6	 Data was not collected in 3 separate periods.

Audience Outcome: Employee engagement Employee engagement surveys provide detailed data and insights for leaders and managers to use  to improve the workplace. Organisational responsiveness to employee feedback leads to higher  retention rates, lower absenteeism, improved productivity, higher service levels and better employee  morale. The engagement survey, administered using the Qualtrics system and method, uses four  questions to determine the overall engagement of the workforce.

The results showed that ABC employees collaborate to get the job done, they are proud to work for the ABC and  that they feel supported and respected at work. It also identified that there are opportunities for improvement,  including for information to be shared better across the ABC and for greater support to be provided for adapting  to organisational changes.

It supports  the ABC’s Charter which requires the ABC to  “contribute to a sense of national identity”  and “reflect the cultural diversity of the  Australian community”. As of July 2023, the ABC transitioned from the  previous NESB definition10 (NESB Data) to CALD11  (CALD Data), resulting in an updated target  of 30% for CALD Executives and 30% CALD  Content Maker representation by July 2026.  This categorisation has been updated to ensure  we are fully capturing the nuance of cultural  diversity by including additional measures  of CALD and that the ABC is in line with the  Diversity Council of Australia’s recommendation  for measuring cultural diversity. The ABC  has continued the campaign to encourage  employees to complete the updated diversity  and inclusion data collection form which is  currently at 60% of the organisation.  A focus for this plan is inclusion which is the first  step in creating a culture of belonging. The ABC  is working to build a culture that values the  experiences and knowledge of all employees  in a respectful environment where everyone  can be their best self. To begin the process  of building inclusion, in 2023/24 the ABC has: •	 Launched the Building an Inclusive  Culture Training  •	 Commenced the development of Team  Inclusion Plans •	 Created Divisional Action plans, which  includes initiatives from the DIB and RAP •	 Hosted an annual Indigenous and  Diversity Symposium In 2023, ABC launched its first Indigenous &  Diversity Symposium, providing a platform for  diverse voices and outlining our commitments  in this vital area to the entire organisation.  This event was broadcast nationwide internally,  allowing employees to interact with a diverse  panel and celebrate every story. Looking ahead to 2024, ABC will again host the  Indigenous & Diversity Symposium in Melbourne.  This event will continue to amplify diverse  voices, acknowledge ongoing challenges, and  celebrate our achievements in this space so far. 10	 NESB (non-English speaking background) focused on country of birth and language. 11	 Identification of CALD employees includes additional questions around personal identification and ethnicity/ancestry. 144  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 147 ===== Measure Measure Source Data Source 2023–24  Target 2023–24  Result 2022–23  Result Indigenous  employees12,13 ABC Corporate Plan  2023–24 Employee data 3.4% 3.1%14 3.2%15 Analysis: Target not met.  The target of achieving 3.4% Indigenous representation has not yet been reached. There has been a slight  decrease in representation compared to this time last year. Over the past 12 months, the ABC has put in place  measures to help increase representation, including: •	 the establishment of the Indigenous Employee-led Network Group, ABC Mob; •	 hosting the Indigenous Staff Conference; •	 ongoing engagement and promotion of NAIDOC week both internally and externally; •	 the appointment of Cultural Advisors to support content creators. These efforts aim to alleviate the cultural  responsibilities placed on our Indigenous and Culturally diverse employees; and  •	 the ABC has continued to promote their commitment to the initiatives outlined in our RAP which are  highlighted in the divisional action plans.

The ABC acknowledges the need for workforce representation increase of CALD Executives and expects initiatives  that form part of the DIB, build upon previous efforts. These include: •	 reviewing retention rates and developing a framework to enhance retention of CALD Executives; •	 updated recruitment training and support materials; and •	 ongoing promotion of the CALD mentoring program.  These measures aim to strengthen our approach to CALD Executive representation and foster a more  representative and supportive executive leadership team and are set to continue in 2024. 12	 Targets based on annual measurement from 1 September to 31 August, as required by the Equal Employment Opportunity (Commonwealth Authorities)  Act 1987. 13	 Represents employees who voluntarily self-identify as indigenous and are verified by the ABC. 14	 Percentage based on 60% of employees voluntarily providing Equal Employment Opportunity information as of 30 June 2024 using the CALD Data. 15	 Percentage based on 86% of employees voluntarily providing Equal Employment Opportunity information as of 30 June 2023 using the NESB Data. 16	 Calculation based on a series of questions that employees voluntary answer. 17	 Percentage based on 70% of executives voluntarily providing Equal Employment Opportunity information as of 30 June 2024 using the CALD Data. 18	  based on 93% of executives voluntarily providing Equal Employment Opportunity information as of 30 June 2023 using the NESB Data.   145  ===== PAGE 148 ===== Measure Measure Source Data Source 2023–24  Target 2023–24  Result 2022–23  Result Culturally diverse  content makers ABC Corporate Plan  2023–24 Employee data 26% 24.2%19 13.3%20 Analysis: Target not met.

The ABC has achieved the interim target for employees with disability at 6.2%. The ABC remains committed to fostering an inclusive and accessible workplace. In 2023, the ABC was recognised  within the top 10 of the Australian Disability Network (ADN) Access and Inclusion Index. This is a key milestone  that supports our year-on-year improvement in workforce accessibility and inclusion of employees and audience  members with disability. Our employee-led network group, ABC Inclusive, continues to play a pivotal role within our workforce, advocating  for the disability community. In 2023, off the back of recommendations from ABC Inclusive, the ABC introduced  the Accessibility Council which was established to focus on whole-of-ABC content accessibility including  Audio Description and Podcast transcription, enhancing accessibility for audiences previously unable to enjoy  these programs.  Looking ahead, the ABC will prioritise inclusive design and digital accessibility. We will launch a Disability Action  Plan (DAP) and maintain our engagement with the Access and Inclusion Index to monitor our advancements in  this area. 19	 Percentage based on 53% of content makers voluntarily providing Equal Employment Opportunity information as of 30 June 2024 using the CALD Data. 20	 Percentage based on 83% of content makers voluntarily providing Equal Employment Opportunity information as of 30 June 2023 using the NESB Data. 21	 Represents employees who voluntarily self-identify as living with a disability. 22	 Percentage based on 60% of employees voluntarily providing Equal Employment Opportunity information as of 30 June 2024. 146  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 149 ===== Measure: Editorial quality Proper attention to editorial governance and complaints handling, supported by training, is an  essential component of the ABC’s commitment to quality editorial content and adherence to the  ABC’s Charter and editorial standards.

Transmitter numbers for radio services do not include transmitters operated by self-help  retransmission operators, or the Launceston Local Radio infill service operated by the ABC.  	 2.	 BAI Communications Transmission Network (ABC Transmission Contractor): The transmission network performance data is reported by BAI  Communications in the period 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024. This is a contracted deliverable and is measured against the Service Level Agreement  (SLA) for each service, network, or sub national network. The data is regularly reviewed and authenticated by ABC Transmission Network Services.  Emergency Broadcast requirements occasionally result in services carrying content not advertised for transmission to audiences in order to advise  of events of significance. This is captured in Availability figures where relevant. There are 13 Class E digital radio services that are provided by BAI  Communications for the ABC where contract performance is not measured as a target of overall uptime. These services are provided to equalise  audience experience across both national and commercial and community broadcasters. 	 3.	 Total Network Availability shows the impact of all outages on the overall network: This reflects all faults across the transmission networks regardless  of severity or cause or whether subject to a Service Level Agreement (SLA) or not. The vast majority of these faults are services not meeting  full specification such as lower transmission power as agreed by the ABC on a case-by-case basis. 	 4.	 Total ‘On-Air’ Availability: The figures show ‘off-air’ occurrences where no service was provided due to faults and/or maintenance activity.  It is important to note that most maintenance activity is undertaken after midnight to reduce audience impact. 	 5.	 RBA Holdings Transmission Network (Self Help Services): The transmission network performance data is reported by RBA Holdings in the period 1  July 2023 to 30 June 2024. This is a contracted deliverable and is provided for ABC information purposes to record outage times and respond to  audience requests for information. These services are provided to equalise audience experience across regional Australia. 	 6.	 RBA Holdings Reporting Quality: The RBAH provided transmission services do not have the same reporting obligations as BAI Communications’  National Transmission Network. Maintenance operator data provided by RBAH is incomplete. The ABC has relied upon the MediaHub off-air fault  reports for RBAH facilities in FY2024. Performance data for Seven Queensland and Southern Cross operated services was not available at the time  of publication. RBAH has undertaken to implement performance reporting improvements. 27	 Digital Radio figures reflect the period up until and including period 11 of FY24. Final data not available at the time of reporting. Figures are anticipated  to be available in the week beginning 12 August 2024.Photo shows Marc Fennell standing before the Tower Bridge in London with the Thames River in the background.

Financial Outcome 2023–24 The ABC operated within its total sources  of funds and revenue from Government for  the 2023–24 financial year, recording a minor  technical operating deficit of $2.2 million due  to the timing impact of AASB 16 right-of-use  leasing implementation. Excluding the leasing  impact, the ABC recorded a minor surplus.

Included in this amount is $20.9m for the “Better  Funded National Broadcasters” terminating  measure and $8m for the “Pacific Security and  Engagement Initiatives” terminating measure.  Both of these terminating measures are for  four years and 2023–24 is year two of the four  year measures. The ABC was also allocated  additional funding of $8.5 million over four  years from 2023–24 for Pacific integration  transmission services as part of the Enhancing  Pacific Engagement measure. 2023–24 is the  first year of the four-year measure with funding  of $4.7 million.  The ABC also received $98.7 million from other  sources, including ABC Commercial, digital  news content agreements, international grants  and interest income during the year.  The chart “ABC Source of Funds” depicts the  ABC’s budgeted funds for the various categories  against actual sources for 2023–24 and its  budgeted sources for 2024–25. Application of Funds The chart “Split of actual expenses 2023–24”  broadly represents how the ABC allocates its  funds by cost category. The Year Ahead Revenue from Government The 2024–25 year represents the second year  of the new five-year funding period. There were  no changes to ABC funding announced in the  May 2024 Federal Budget. Pie chart shows ABC r evenue from government by p rogramme in 2023-24.

These amounts will  be incorporated into the ABC’s ongoing funding  base as part of five-year funding arrangements,  providing certainty for services previously  delivered under terminating funding. Funding in 2024–25 also includes $1.3m of  Enhancing Pacific Engagement funding as  well as Better Funded National Broadcasters  funding of $20.9 million and Pacific Security and  Engagement funding of $8.0 million announced  in the October 2022 Budget, with both these  funding measures terminating after 2025–26.

Budget challenges for the ABC continue to arise,  from cost pressures as well as from changing  audience expectations and technology  requirements, with the need for continued  delivery of content via traditional broadcasting,  while also evolving the ABC to position it as  a relevant service provider to audiences in  an increasingly digital world. The 2024–25  budget prioritises available resources to  focus on initiatives that will achieve Five-Year  Plan objectives.  In order to meet budget challenges, projects will  be implemented in the budget year to continue  transforming the ABC, including consolidating  benefits of the Content Restructure and the  People Hub Workforce projects, completion of  the Sydney Accommodation Project, reviewing  support costs, increasing focus on investment  in digital technology and products, and building  staff capabilities.  The ABC will continue to focus on finding  efficiencies and evolving workflows to  enable the focus of available resources  on the modernisation of services and  the implementation of a digital-first  approach to commissioning, producing  and distributing content.   These initiatives will contribute towards  achieving the new Five-Year Plan priorities  of prioritising the trust of our audiences,  delivering compelling content to build  a lifelong relationship with Australians,  reflecting contemporary Australia and making  sustainable choices in allocating resources. The ABC remains committed to prioritising  available resources to enable it to most  effectively deliver on its Charter obligations  and remain relevant to audiences in Australia’s  cultural and media landscape into the future. 158  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 161 ===== Line g raph  depicting  ABC  Ope rat ion al  Rev enu e f rom  gove rnmen t in  the y ears  1985- 86 (w hen i t was  $148 6 mil lion)  to 2 024-2 5 (no w $99 0 mil lion) .

(b)	 An explanation of the variance between the actual result and the budget for this item is detailed in Note 1 Explanation of Major Variances between Actual  Results and Original Budget under the heading E. Cash Flow Statement   169  ===== PAGE 172 ===== 1.  Explanation of Major Variances between Actual Results and  Original Budget Explanations are provided for significant  variances between actual results and  the budget, as reflected in the Portfolio  Budget Statements 2023–24 (PBS) of  the Infrastructure, Transport, Regional  Development, Communications and the Arts  Portfolio, published in May 2023. Significant  variances include variances of $25,000,000  or more, and variances which are otherwise  materially relevant to the performance of the  ABC. The budget is not audited. Values in this  Note are rounded to the nearest thousand,  consistent with the PBS. The ABC’s total comprehensive loss for the  financial year to 30 June 2024 was $2,205,000  which was $169,000 favourable compared to  the budgeted loss of $2,374,000.  A.  Term deposits The balance in Term deposits at 30 June 2024  was $271,550,000 which was $25,252,000 higher  than the budget of $246,298,000. Term deposits  comprise investments of surplus cash in term  deposits with an original maturity of more  than three months. The higher balance was due to a short-term  increase in surplus cash which was invested  in term deposits. The short-term increase in  surplus cash was mainly due to the timing of  inventory acquisitions and the rephasing of  capital project activity into the next financial  year in line with approved business cases.  This largely relates to the timing of payment  for the Sydney Accommodation Project.  B.  Owned non-financial assets – land  and buildings The balance of land assets at 30 June 2024 was  $255,881,000 which was $33,002,000 higher  than the budget of $222,879,000. The balance  of buildings assets at 30 June 2024 was  $440,794,000 which was $43,639,000 higher  than the budget of $397,155,000. The variances  were mainly due to the revaluation of the ABC’s  property portfolio completed for the year ended  30 June 2023 and carrying into the year ended  30 June 2024. The revaluation adjustments  were not included in the budget as property  revaluations are completed by independent  experts and had not been finalised at the time  the budget was set. Variances to buildings  assets value were also due to timing of office  fit‑out works at the Ultimo and Parramatta sites.  C.  Right-of-use non-financial assets – plant and  equipment, and lease liability The balance of right-of-use non-financial assets  –plant and equipment at 30 June 2024 was  $421,770,000 which was $24,270,000 higher than  the budget of $397,500,000. The balance of the  lease liability at 30 June 2024 was $473,143,000  which was $24,075,000 higher than the budget  of $449,068,000. These variances to budget  were mainly due to a reassessment to the  lease liability from higher lease payments  (as measured over the term of the leases), with  a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use  asset. The reassessment to the lease accounts  were not included in the budget as had not been  finalised at the time the budget was set.  D.  Asset revaluation reserve The asset revaluation reserve balance of  $898,247,000 was $61,130,000 higher than the  budget of $837,117,000. The variance was due to  the revaluation of the ABC’s property portfolio  undertaken by independent experts which was  completed and booked in the accounts for the  year ended 30 June 2023. The revaluation was  not included in the budget for the year ended  30 June 2024 as the revaluation had not been  completed at the time of budget preparation. E.  Cash Flow Statement The Cash Flow Statement shows the gross  amounts related to Proceeds from term deposits  and Purchase of term deposits separately under  Investing Activities for the year ended 30 June  2024 actual results, while the budget shows the  net figure against Proceeds from term deposits.  Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2024 170  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 173 ===== 2.  Overview The ABC is a Corporate Commonwealth, not-for- profit entity incorporated in Australia.  The ABC’s head office is located at ABC Ultimo  Centre 700 Harris Street Ultimo New South  Wales Australia (GPO Box 9994 Sydney  NSW 2001). Its functions are set out in section 6 of the  Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983.  Those functions are reflected in the statement  of purpose in the ABC Corporate Plan 2023–24,  which was prepared in accordance with section  35 of the PGPA Act. The continued existence of the ABC in its  present form and with its present programs  is dependent on Government policy and on  continuing funding by Parliament for the ABC’s  administration and programs. The Basis of Preparation The financial statements are required by  section 42 of the PGPA Act. The financial statements have been prepared  in accordance with: (a)	the FRR; and (b)	Australian Accounting Standards and  Interpretations– including simplified  disclosures for Tier 2 Entities under  AASB 1060 issued by the Australian  Accounting Standards Board (AASB) that  apply for the reporting period. The financial statements have been prepared  on an accrual basis and in accordance with the  historical cost convention, except for certain  assets and liabilities which are at fair value.  Except where stated, no allowance is made for  the effect of changing prices on the results or  the financial position. The financial statements are presented in  Australian dollars and values are rounded  to the nearest thousand dollars unless  otherwise specified.  New Accounting Standards There were no new or revised standards  effective for the current reporting period  that had a material effect on the ABC’s  financial statements. Income Tax The ABC is exempt from all forms of taxation  except Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) and the Goods  and Services Tax (GST). Any income tax benefit or expense, asset or  liability, presented in the financial statements  and accompanying notes, is attributable to joint  operations. Any income tax expense or benefit  is recorded as Income tax (expense)/benefit  attributable to joint operations in the Statement  of Comprehensive Income. A tax asset is  recorded in the Statement of Financial Position  in Tax assets. Changes to comparatives Where appropriate, comparatives have been  reclassified from the prior period to align with  the current period presentation. There has  been no such reclassification within the  financial statements.  Significant Accounting Estimates  and Assumptions The ABC has taken the fair value of freehold  land to be the market value of similar locations  and the fair value of freehold buildings to be the  depreciated replacement cost, as determined  by an independent valuer. In addition, the ABC has taken the fair value of  plant and equipment to be the depreciated cost.   171  ===== PAGE 174 ===== Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements  for the year ended 30 June 2024 2.  Overview (continued) The ABC has applied estimates and  assumptions to the following significant items: •	 Depreciation and amortisation, as detailed  in Note 3C Depreciation and amortisation  on owned assets, and Note 7A Owned  land, buildings, plant and equipment  and intangibles; •	 Program amortisation, as detailed in  Note 3E Program amortisation, and  Note 7C Inventories; •	 Valuation of land, buildings, plant and  equipment, as detailed in Note 7A Owned  land, buildings, plant and equipment  and intangibles; •	 Leased assets and lease liabilities,  specifically identification of leased assets  and lease liabilities where the ABC has  the right to obtain substantially all of the  economic benefits, as detailed in Note  7B Right-of-use assets and Note 9B Lease  Liability; and •	 Employee provisions, as detailed in Note 11  Employee Provisions. No other accounting assumptions or estimates  have been identified that have a significant risk  of causing a material adjustment to carrying  amounts of assets and liabilities. Events After the Reporting Period There were no subsequent events after  the reporting period which required any  adjustments or additional disclosures to be  incorporated in these financial statements. 172  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 175 ===== Financial Performance – Expenses 3.  Expenses Note 3A to 3C Notes 2024 $’000 2023 $’000 3A  Employee benefits Salaries and wages 431,973  423,136  Superannuation – defined contribution plans 51,661  54,916  – defined benefit plans 27,155  22,120  Leave and other entitlements 64,641  57,868  Separation and redundancies 2,629  21,333  Other employee benefits 5,880  6,019  Total employee benefits  583,939  585,392  3B  Suppliers  Transmission and distribution contracts 110,179  105,120  Repairs, maintenance, utilities and hire 28,289  23,950  Contractors and consultants 37,483  48,803  Production costs 19,075  16,254  Communications and technology 52,750  44,996  Rights and royalties 20,032  21,335  Travel 17,056  15,846  Materials 4,350  3,158  Promotion costs 13,922  8,981  Other goods and services 16,676  13,695  Workers’ compensation premiums 4,500  4,000  Remuneration to the Auditor General for audit of financial statements  for the period(a) 205  215  Total suppliers  324,517  306,353  3C  Depreciation and amortisation on assets Depreciation Buildings (including improvements) 7A 23,947  21,922  Plant and equipment 7A 37,427  39,271  Total depreciation 61,374  61,193  Amortisation Intangibles 7A 24,071  21,059  Total amortisation 24,071  21,059  Total depreciation and amortisation on assets 85,445  82,252  (a)	 The Australian National Audit Office has contracted KPMG to provide audit services to the Corporation on its behalf.

Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets The ABC has elected not to recognise right- of-use assets and lease liabilities for short  term leases of assets that have a lease term  of 12 months or less and leases of low-value  assets (less than $10,000). The ABC recognises  the lease payments associated with these  leases as an expense on a straight-line basis  over the lease term. For the year ended 30 June  2024, expenditure on short-term leases was  $340,000 (2023 $384,000), expenditure on low  value leases was $5,000 (2023 $6,000) and  expenditure on variable lease payments which  were not included in the measurement of a  lease liability was $98,000 (2023 $87,000). Depreciation on owned assets Depreciable property, plant and equipment  assets are depreciated to their estimated  residual values over their estimated useful lives  using the straight-line method.  Depreciation rates are initially based on asset  useful lives, reviewed each year and adjusted as  appropriate. Useful lives applying to each class  of depreciable asset are referenced in Note 7A  Owned land, buildings, plant and equipment  and intangibles.  Amortisation of owned intangibles Intangibles comprise software for internal use.  Software assets are amortised on a straight- line basis over anticipated useful lives between  3–8 years (2023 3–8 years).  174  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 177 ===== Note 3D to 3I Notes 2024 $’000 2023  $’000 3D  Depreciation on right-of-use assets Land 7B 243  243  Buildings 7B 3,537  2,689  Plant and equipment 7B 67,494  62,776  Total depreciation on right-of-use assets 71,274  65,708  3E  Program amortisation Purchased 34,216  34,444  Produced 131,505  122,782  Total program amortisation 165,721  157,226  3F  Finance costs Other finance costs 91  94  Total finance costs 14B 91  94  3G  Interest cost on lease liability Buildings 1,580  557  Plant and equipment 5,391  5,630  Total interest cost on lease liability 6,971  6,187  3H  Impairment loss on financial instruments Trade and other receivables 43  122  Total impairment loss on financial instruments 43  122  3I  Write-down and impairment of other assets Commercial advances 1,651  862  Assets under construction 193  73  Inventory held for sale  59  53  Total write-down and impairment of other assets 1,903  988  Accounting Policy Depreciation on Right-of-use assets The depreciation rates for right-of-use assets  are calculated on a straight-line basis.  The depreciable period extends from the  commencement date of the lease to the end  of the lease term or the end of the useful life  of the right-of-use asset if earlier.  Amortisation of purchased programs  Purchased program inventory is amortised in  accordance with the policy for amortisation  of produced programs. Subsequent sales of  residual rights are recognised in the period  in which they occur.    175  ===== PAGE 178 ===== Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements  for the year ended 30 June 2024 3.  Expenses (continued) Amortisation of produced programs The cost of produced television program  inventory is amortised as follows: •	 Live Programs, Factual and Entertainment  programs based on current topics — 100%  on first screening; •	 Children’s, Education and Movies —  straight‑line over three years from  completion of production; •	 ABC iview-only programs — 100% on first  release; and •	 Programs not covered above — 100% on  first screening.  In addition to the above, programs that are  assessed as no longer having any service  potential are 100% expensed at the time of  the assessment. The costs of News, Radio and ABC International  programs are expensed as incurred. Such  programs are normally broadcast soon after  production and stock on hand is minimal at  any point in time. The valuation of inventory is  addressed in Note 7C Inventories. Finance costs All borrowing costs are expensed as incurred. Interest costs on the liability attributable  to right-of-use assets Interest is calculated on the monthly  outstanding balance of the lease liability  (refer Note 9B Lease liability). Assumptions surrounding uncertainty —  interest costs on the liability attributable to  right‑of‑use assets The valuation of the lease liability is influenced  by the discount rate, as advised, on a quarterly  basis, by the Commonwealth Department of  Finance. The corresponding interest charged  on the outstanding balance is a function of the  incremental borrowing cost derived from the  discount rate applicable at the commencement  of the lease. The carrying balance of the  lease liability is reviewed regularly and an  assessment is made of the potential impact of a  change in discount rates on this balance upon  any lease modifications or reassessments. Impairment loss on financial instruments Under AASB 9 Financial Instruments,  impairment of financial assets is provided for on  the basis of future expected credit losses (ECLs)  rather than as and when existing debts are  deemed to be impaired. This allows for the expectation of credit  losses to be adjusted in response to certain  factors, for example prevailing or anticipated  market conditions.  Accounting Policy Write-down and impairment of other assets Where indications of impairment exist, the  asset’s recoverable amount is estimated  and an impairment adjustment is made if the  asset’s recoverable amount is less than its  carrying amount. The recoverable amount of an asset is the  greater of its fair value less costs to sell and its  value in use. Value in use is the present value of  the future cash flows that the asset is expected  to generate. Where the future economic benefit  of an asset is not primarily dependent on the  asset’s ability to generate future cash flows,  and the asset would be replaced if the ABC were  deprived of the asset, its value in use is taken to  be its depreciated replacement cost. At 30 June 2024, the ABC had performed  assessments to determine the extent of any  indications that assets may be impaired  and the resultant financial impact has been  incorporated in the table above. Losses on disposal of assets Losses from disposal of assets are recognised  when control of the asset has passed to  the buyer. 176  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 179 ===== Financial Performance – Revenue and Income 4.  Own-Source Income Note 4A to 4B  Notes 2024 $’000 2023  $’000 4A  Revenue from contracts with customers Sale of goods 45,473  52,385  Rendering of services 24,506  25,362  Total revenue from contracts with customers 69,979  77,747  Disaggregation of revenue from contracts with customers Major product/service line Royalties 17,283  17,051  Content sales 27,707  34,333  Joint operations 9,264  9,559  Grants and service contracts 11,777  10,747  Co-productions 3,002  4,627  Other contract revenue 946  1,430  Total by major product/service line 69,979  77,747  Type of customer: Australian government entities 4,063  3,823  Non-government entities 65,916  73,924  Total by type of customer 69,979  77,747  Timing of transfer of good and services Over time 21,268  20,523  Point in time 48,711  57,224  Total by timing of transfer of good and services 69,979  77,747  4B  Interest Financial instruments 23,324  11,549  Total interest 14B 23,324  11,549    177  ===== PAGE 180 ===== Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements  for the year ended 30 June 2024 4.  Own-Source Income (continued) Accounting Policy Disaggregation of revenue from contracts  with customers  Royalties  Royalty income arising from sales and usage- based royalties are recognised at the later of  when the subsequent sales or usage occurs,  or when the performance obligation has  been satisfied. Therefore, royalty income is  recognised at a ‘point in time’. Content sales  Licence fees from program content are  recognised on the later of the start of the  licence period (taking into account any  holdback dates) or when the ABC’s performance  obligations have been satisfied. For content  sales the performance obligation is generally to  deliver the associated program to the customer,  therefore income is recognised on delivery of  each episode or package of content.  Joint Operations  Revenue attributable to joint operations  represents the ABC’s 50% share of revenue from  the ABC’s joint operation, MediaHub Australia  Pty Limited (MediaHub). This revenue comprises  services fees recognised ‘over time’ in line with  when the services (predominantly for broadcast  presentation) are provided. Grants and Services Contracts  Revenue for grants and services contracts with  specific performance obligations (primarily for  international aid and development projects)  is recognised ‘over time’ in line with when  the services are provided, on an expense  reimbursement or on a stage of completion  basis. Pursuant to AASB 1058 Income of  Not‑for-Profit Entities, Grants from Government  departments without specific performance  obligations are recognised as income in the  financial year that they relate to.  Co-productions  Income generated from co-production is  recognised on delivery of the related materials  or on a stage of completion basis, depending on  the nature of the contract with the customer.  Other Contract Revenue  Other contract revenue includes items such as  commissions and distribution fees which are  recognised at the later of when the subsequent  sales or usage occurs.  Interest Revenue Interest income is recognised as it accrues using  the effective interest method and if not received  at balance date, is reflected in the Statement of  Financial Position as a receivable. 178  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 181 ===== Note 4C to 4G Notes 2024  $’000 2023  $’000 4C  Other revenue Lease and other revenue 5,389  4,541  Total other revenue 5,389  4,541  4D  Net gain from disposal of assets Land and buildings Total proceeds from disposal – 92,409  Carrying value of assets disposed  – (92,050) Net gain from disposal of land and buildings – 359  Infrastructure, plant and equipment Total proceeds from disposal 89  514  Carrying value of assets disposed (2) (4) Cost of disposal (23) (75) Net gain from disposal of infrastructure, plant and equipment 64  435  Total net gain from disposal of assets Total proceeds from disposal 89  92,923  Total carrying value of assets disposed (2) (92,054) Total costs of disposal (23) (75) Total net gain from disposal of assets 64  794  4E  Net foreign exchange gain Non-speculative 789  820  Total net foreign exchange gain 14B 789  820  4F  Insurance recoveries Insurance recoveries 816  1,854  Total insurance recoveries 816  1,854  4G  Other gains Reversal of prior years write-downs and impairments for: – Land and buildings – 22  Derecognition of existing leases 2  – Total other gains 2  22    179  ===== PAGE 182 ===== Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements  for the year ended 30 June 2024 4.  Own-Source Income (continued) Accounting Policy Lease and other revenue Other revenue largely comprises revenue  from lease or hire of ABC owned or controlled  facilities. Rental income from the lease of ABC  owned or controlled premises is recognised  as lease income under AASB 16 Leases and  disclosed separately to other revenue from  contracts with customers. For the year ended  30 June 2024, revenue earned from sub-leased  right of use assets was nil (2023 nil). Gains from disposal of assets Gains from disposal of assets are recognised  when control of the asset has passed to the  buyer. For the year ended 30 June 2024, gains  or losses arising from sale and leaseback  transactions were nil (2023 nil). Foreign currency transactions  The Corporation enters into foreign currency  hedging arrangements to protect its purchasing  power in relation to foreign currency exposures.  Revenues and expenditures denominated in  foreign currencies are converted to Australian  dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at the  date of the transaction or at the hedged rate.  Gains and losses are taken to surplus/(deficit),  except for transactions classified as cash flow  hedges which are recognised in the hedging  reserve within equity if material in value. Operating lease revenue commitments  These commitments, largely relating to  rental income for letting out office space,  are presented exclusive of GST.  Lease terms are typically between one to  five years in duration and income is subject  to increases in accordance with CPI or other  agreed increments. Operating lease revenue is earned via leasing of  spare capacity within the ABC’s properties and  resources. The ABC leases out spare capacity  only on assets it controls. There are no rights- related risks associated with the underlying  assets that are being leased.

The cost of acquisition includes the fair  value of assets transferred in exchange and  liabilities undertaken.  Assets acquired at no cost, or for nominal  consideration, are initially recognised as assets  at their fair value at the date of acquisition. Fair value measurement of assets and liabilities The Corporation has adopted the following  general policies relating to the determination  of fair value of assets and liabilities. AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement requires  disclosure of fair value measurements by level  in accordance with the following fair value  measurement hierarchy: •	 Level 1 — quoted prices (unadjusted) in active  markets for identical assets or liabilities; •	 Level 2 — inputs other than quoted prices  included within Level 1 that are observable  for the asset or liability, either directly or  indirectly; and •	 Level 3 — unobservable inputs for an asset  or liability. The fair value of land is determined by reference  to the market value of the land component of  ABC property because it is possible to base the  fair value on recent sales of comparable sites.  The Corporation’s independent valuers detail  these reference sites in valuation reports for  respective properties. No observable market data is available for the  ABC’s buildings, given their highest and best use  as specialised broadcasting facilities. The fair  value of these assets is based on depreciated  replacement cost (Level 3 inputs).  Plant and equipment assets are measured  based on depreciated cost (Level 3 inputs).  Intangibles (software for internal use)  are measured at cost less subsequent  accumulated amortisation and accumulated  impairment losses.  Generally, the fair value of the Corporation’s  other financial assets and liabilities is deemed  to be their carrying value as it approximates  fair value. The fair value of long-term loans is  the net present value of future discounted cash  flows arising. The Corporation does not hold any assets  or liabilities measured at fair value that are  valued using Level 1 inputs (i.e. with reference  to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets  for identical assets or liabilities). The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents,  financial assets and non-interest-bearing  financial liabilities (except for derivatives used  for hedging) of the Corporation, are measured  at amortised cost, which approximates their  fair value. There have been no recurring fair  value measurements transferred between the  respective levels for assets and liabilities for  the year ended 30 June 2024. The aforementioned accounting policy is  summarised for each class of asset and liability  in Note 5A Fair value measurement.   181  ===== PAGE 184 ===== Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements  for the year ended 30 June 2024 5. Financial Position (continued) Measurement of right-of-use assets and  accompanying liability under AASB 16 Leases Leased right-of-use assets are capitalised at the  commencement date of the lease and comprise  the initial lease liability amount and initial  direct costs incurred when entering into the  lease, less any lease incentives received.  An impairment review is undertaken for any  right-of-use asset that shows indicators  of impairment and an impairment loss is  recognised against any right-of-use asset  that is impaired. Leased right-of-use assets  continue to be measured at cost after initial  recognition in Commonwealth agency, general  government sector and whole of government  financial statements.

Accounting Policy Receivables Trade receivables and other receivables that  are held for the purpose of collecting the  contractual cash flows where the cash flows are  solely payments of principal and interest, that  are not provided at below-market interest rates,  are subsequently measured at amortised cost  using the effective interest method adjusted  for any loss allowance. Impairment of receivables The ABC calculates an impairment loss  allowance, based on historical rates of  credit impairment, adjusted for any external  factors likely to impact the rate of impairment.  The carrying value of the impairment allowance  loss is monitored against the value of debts  likely to be considered at risk of being  non‑recoverable. At 30 June 2024, the balance  of the impairment loss allowance is $227,000  (2023 $194,000).  For the year ended 30 June 2024, this  amount was sufficient to cover outstanding  debt attributable to customers at risk of  non‑recoverability. Term deposits Surplus cash is invested into short term  deposits with maturities at acquisition date of  greater than three months. These term deposits  are due to be recovered within twelve months. 186  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 189 ===== 7.  Non-Financial Assets 7A  Owned land, buildings, plant and equipment and intangibles Reconciliation of opening and closing balances of owned land, buildings, plant and equipment  and intangibles at 30 June 2024 is as follows: Land  $’000 Buildings  (including  improvements) $’000 Plant and  equipment  $’000 Intangibles $’000 Total  $’000 Carrying amount as at 30 June 2023  represented by Gross book value 255,881  425,838  565,051  195,415  1,442,185  Assets under construction – 3,135  33,898  8,787  45,820  Accumulated depreciation and amortisation – (7,592) (408,909) (110,679) (527,180) Closing net book value as at 30 June 2023 255,881  421,381  190,040  93,523  960,825  Assets controlled by ABC Additions – 32,650  42,207  50,083  124,940  Depreciation and amortisation – (23,625) (36,283) (24,071) (83,979) Disposals – – (2) – (2) Net additions to assets under construction – 11,544  22,706  37,252  71,502  Net transfers from assets under construction – (858) (12,917) (40,072) (53,847) Write-down and impairment of assets  under construction – –  (152) (41) (193) Assets attributable to joint operations Additions – 24  961  – 985  Depreciation – (322) (1,144) – (1,466) Net additions to assets under construction – – – – – Net transfers from assets under construction – – (193) – (193) Net book value as at 30 June 2024 255,881  440,794  205,223  116,674  1,018,572  Carrying amount as at 30 June 2024  represented by Gross book value 255,881  454,810  578,324  239,715  1,528,730  Assets under construction – 13,821  43,342  5,926  63,089  Accumulated depreciation and amortisation – (27,837) (416,443) (128,967) (573,247) Closing net book value as at 30 June 2024 255,881  440,794  205,223  116,674  1,018,572  Useful lives of and measurement basis of asset classes  Asset Class  Measurement Basis Useful Life Land Fair value – market price Not applicable Buildings* Fair value – depreciated replacement cost 50 years Building improvements Fair value – depreciated replacement cost 15 to 50 years Plant and equipment Fair value (or an amount not materially different from fair value) –  depreciated replacement cost 3 to 15 years Intangibles (software) Cost 3 to 8 years *	 The useful lives of individual buildings are occasionally adjusted in accordance with advice from independent valuers.   187  ===== PAGE 190 ===== Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements  for the year ended 30 June 2024 7.  Non-Financial Assets (continued) Accounting Policy Land, buildings, plant and equipment  and intangibles  The measurement basis for land, buildings,  plant and equipment and intangibles is set out  in Note 5A Fair value measurement. Asset recognition threshold Purchases of land, buildings, plant, equipment  and intangibles are recognised initially at cost  in the Statement of Financial Position.  Purchases costing less than $2,000 are  expensed in the year of acquisition except  where they form part of a project or group of  similar items, which are significant in total. Revaluation Following initial recognition at cost, owned  land, buildings and plant and equipment  are measured at fair value (or an amount  not materially different from fair value) less  subsequent accumulated depreciation and  accumulated impairment losses. Valuations are conducted with sufficient  frequency to ensure that the carrying amounts  of assets do not materially vary from the assets’  fair values as at the reporting date. The ABC  commissions an independent expert valuer  to complete a comprehensive valuation of  land and building assets every three years.  This process was completed in the year ended  30 June 2023 and will next be completed in the  year ended 30 June 2026. In the intervening  period management undertake a review of  property values with input from an independent  expert to ascertain the appropriateness of  asset carrying values. Revaluation adjustments are made on a class  basis. Any revaluation increment is credited  to equity under the heading of revaluation  reserve except to the extent that it reverses a  previous revaluation decrement of the same  asset class, previously recognised through  surplus/(deficit). Revaluation decrements for a  class of assets are recognised directly through  surplus/(deficit) except to the extent that they  reverse a previous revaluation increment for  that class. Any accumulated depreciation at the  revaluation date is eliminated against the gross  carrying amount of the asset and the asset  restated to the revalued amount. Impairment of non-current assets The aforementioned classes of assets have been  and continue to be subjected to an assessment  as to indicators of impairment under AASB 136  Impairment of Assets as at 30 June 2024. Impairment is assessed with consideration of  the asset’s remaining service value.

Accounting Policy General principles Right-of-use assets are capitalised at the  commencement date of the lease and comprise  the initial lease liability amount and initial  direct costs incurred when entering into the  lease, less any lease incentives received.  Following initial recognition, an impairment  review is undertaken for any right-of-use asset  that shows indicators of impairment and an  impairment loss is recognised against any right- of-use asset that is impaired. Right-of-use assets  continue to be measured at cost after initial  recognition in Commonwealth agency, general  government sector and Whole of Government  financial statements. Land  The ABC’s right-of-use land is measured at cost,  in accordance with the requirements of the  PGPA (Financial Reporting) Rule 2015. Buildings Right-of-use buildings largely consist of  regional broadcasting offices and the ABC’s  overseas reporting bureaus.  Plant and equipment Right-of-use plant and equipment comprises: •	 a satellite transponder for digital television  distribution; •	 decoder boxes and dishes for satellite  downlink services to support television  transmission;  •	 transmission facility assets for digital  terrestrial television transmission; •	 transmission facility assets for terrestrial  radio transmission; and •	 vehicles.   189  ===== PAGE 192 ===== Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements  for the year ended 30 June 2024 7.  Non-Financial Assets (continued) Depreciation The depreciation rates for right-of-use  assets are based on the period of the lease  commencement date to the earlier of the end  of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the  end of the lease term.

Inventories not held for resale are valued at the  lower of cost, adjusted for any loss in service  potential, identified and measured based on the  existence of a current replacement cost that  is lower than the original acquisition cost or  other subsequent carrying amount. Television programs are produced for domestic  transmission and digital distribution. The cost  of these programs includes co-production  fees, direct salaries and expenses and  production overheads allocated on a usage  basis to the program. Production overheads  not allocated to programs are expensed  in the period in which they are incurred.  External contributions received in respect of  co‑production of television programs are offset  against production costs which are recorded  as Inventories in the Statement of Financial  Position. The amortisation of inventories is  addressed in Note 3E Program amortisation. Write-down of inventory held for distribution When inventories held for distribution are  distributed, the carrying amount of those  inventories is recognised as an expense.  The amount of any write-down of inventories  for loss of service potential, and all losses  of inventories are recognised as an expense  in the period the write-down or loss occurs.  The amount of any reversal of any write-down  of inventories arising from a reversal of the  circumstances that gave rise to the loss of  service potential will be recognised as a  reduction in the value of inventories recognised  as an expense in the period in which the  reversal occurs. Write-down of retail inventory The amount of any write-down of inventories to  net realisable value and all losses of inventory  are recognised as an expense in the period  the write-down or loss occurs. The amount of  any reversal of any write-down of inventories  arising from an increase in the net realisable  value will be recognised as an inventory  expense reduction in the period in which the  reversal occurs.

At 30 June 2024, MediaHub had drawn loans  under eight (2023 nine) facilities with the ANZ,  with an aggregate balance of $2,302,000 (2023  $3,000,000). The ABC’s share, as reflected in its  Statement of Financial Position, is $1,151,000  (2023 $1,500,000). These facilities are generally  repayable over five years. The facility is provided on an average variable  interest rate ended 30 June 2024 of 6.06%  (2023 4.60%). Lease liability Note 9B Lease liability is the present value of  future contractual payments, for the remaining  life of the contracts. The present value of the  lease liability is $473,143,000 (2023 $507,189,000).  The life of the contracts includes extension  options which the ABC is reasonably certain  to exercise. The total cash outflow for leases for the  year ended 30 June 2024 was $75,568,000  (2023 $69,690,000). The undiscounted value  of future lease payments is $518,414,000  (2023 $557,552,000). The average discount  rate, determined with reference to the  Commonwealth Department of Finance  incremental borrowing rates, issued quarterly,  was approximately 1.37% (2023 1.26%).  192  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 195 ===== Assumptions surrounding uncertainty –  Lease liability The valuation of the lease liability is influenced  by the discount rate, as advised, on a quarterly  basis, by the Commonwealth Department of  Finance. The carrying balance of this item  is reviewed regularly and an assessment is  made of the potential impact of a change in  discount rates on this balance upon any lease  modifications or reassessments. For all new contracts entered into, the ABC  considers whether the contract is, or contains  a lease. A lease is defined as ‘a contract, or part  of a contract, that conveys the right to use an  asset (the underlying asset) for a period of time  in exchange for consideration’. Once it has been determined that a contract is,  or contains a lease, the lease liability is initially  measured at the present value of the lease  payments unpaid at the commencement date,  discounted using the interest rate implicit in the  lease, if that rate is readily determinable, or the  department’s incremental borrowing rate. The corresponding asset value, as disclosed in  Note 7B Right-of-use assets, is initially measured  based on the value of the liability. Subsequent to initial measurement, the  liability is reduced for payments made and  increased for interest. It is remeasured to  reflect any reassessment or modification to the  lease. When the lease liability is remeasured,  the corresponding adjustment is reflected  in the right-of-use asset or profit and loss  depending on the nature of the re-assessment  or modifications.   193  ===== PAGE 196 ===== Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements  for the year ended 30 June 2024 10.  Other Provisions Note 10 2024 $’000 2023  $’000 10  Other provisions Make good 4,830  3,888  Total other provisions 4,830  3,888  Reconciliation of the make good provision Opening balance 3,888  6,887  Amounts used – (3,751) New/additional amounts provided 942  846  Unwinding of discount or change in discount rate – (94) Closing balance 4,830  3,888  Accounting Policy Other provisions Provisions are recognised when the Corporation  has a present legal or constructive obligation as  a result of a past event, where it is probable that  an outflow of resources embodying economic  benefits will be required to settle the obligation  and a reliable estimate can be made of the  amount of the obligation.

Where an employee has a current entitlement  to leave (i.e. is presently entitled to take the leave) or will have a present entitlement within 12 months, the value of that entitlement is included in the  employee provisions expected to settle in no more than 12 months. Where the Corporation expects that an employee will be entitled to leave in the  future but will not yet be entitled to that leave in 12 months, the value of the leave is included in the employee provision expected to settle in more than  12 months. (b)	 A provision is made for estimated historical salary and wages, and superannuation entitlements owed to certain employees. This estimate is based on  an extrapolation of entitlements calculated for a portion of potentially affected employees and factors in risks and uncertainties associated with the  settlement of the liability. The provision for superannuation also includes an amount in respect of an outstanding employer contribution to a defined  benefit superannuation scheme.  Accounting Policy Liabilities for short-term employee benefits and  termination benefits expected within twelve  months of the end of reporting period are  measured at their nominal amounts. Other long- term employee benefits are measured as the net  total of the present value of the defined benefit  obligation at the end of the reporting period  minus the fair value at the end of the reporting  period of plan assets (if any) out of which the  obligations are to be settled directly.  Leave Leave liabilities are calculated based on  employees’ remuneration at the estimated  salary rates that will apply at the time the leave  is taken, including the employer superannuation  contribution rates to the extent that the leave is  likely to be taken during service rather than paid  out on termination. The calculation is based  on the anticipated length of time taken for an  employee to fully settle their leave entitlement.  The long service leave liability is calculated by  an actuary. This amount is determined by reference to  attrition rates and pay increases through  promotion and inflation. This discount rate  is based on the Commonwealth Government  bond yield for a bond with a similar term to  the liability. Redundancy A provision is made for separation and  redundancy benefit payments. The ABC  recognises a provision for termination when it  has developed a detailed formal plan that will  result in the terminations and has informed  those employees affected that it will carry out  the plan.   195  ===== PAGE 198 ===== Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements  for the year ended 30 June 2024 11.  Employee Provisions (continued) Superannuation ABC employees are members of the  Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme  (CSS), Public Sector Superannuation Scheme  (PSS), the Public Sector Superannuation  Accumulation Plan Scheme (PSSap) or another  non-Commonwealth superannuation fund.  The CSS and PSS are defined benefit schemes  for the Australian Government. The PSSap and  other non-Commonwealth funds are defined  contribution schemes. The liability for defined benefits is recognised  in the financial statements of the Australian  Government and is settled by the Australian  Government in due course. This liability is  reported in the Department of Finance’s  administered schedules and notes. The Corporation makes employer contributions  to the employee defined benefit superannuation  schemes at rates determined by an actuary  to be sufficient to meet the current cost  to the Government of the superannuation  entitlements of the Corporation’s employees.  The Corporation accounts for the contributions  in the same manner as contributions to defined  contribution plans. The liability for superannuation recognised at  30 June 2024 represents outstanding historical  contributions at the end of the period. Expenses Expenses attributable to the aforementioned  employee benefits and provisions are reported  in Note 3A Employee benefits. Assumptions surrounding uncertainty –  Measurement of leave liabilities The discount rates used in valuing leave  liabilities are based on Australian government  bond rates with maturities that closely align  with the length of the liability. The ABC regularly  reviews leave liabilities and the impact of any  adjustment to bond rates on these balances. Leave liabilities are also impacted by  assumptions surrounding future salary inflation.  The ABC regularly monitors factors that are  likely to impact future salary inflation. 196  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 199 ===== 12.  Key Management Personnel Remuneration Table A Details of the remuneration of key management personnel for the year Note 12 2024  $ 2023  $ Short-term  employee benefits Post employment  benefits:  Superannuation Other long-term  employee benefits:  Long Service  Leave Termination  Benefits Total Short-term  employee benefits Post employment  benefits:  Superannuation Other long-term  employee benefits:  Long Service  Leave Termination  Benefits Total Executive management David  Anderson  (Managing  Director) 974,069  150,491  34,933  – 1,159,493  974,453  146,711  35,805  – 1,156,969  Michael  Carrington – – – – – 15,480  1,026  (722) 171,308  187,092  Melanie Kleyn 584,362  27,399  21,810  – 633,571  578,921  25,292  14,242  – 618,455  Chris  Oliver‑Taylor 637,138  27,399  8,207  – 672,744  192,982  7,268  1,663  – 201,913  Justin Stevens 460,354  74,397  21,875  – 556,626  451,741  70,061  12,015  – 533,817  Judith Whelan – – – – – 252,781  15,117  10,998  – 278,896  Board Kim Williams  (Chair) 60,405  6,645  – – 67,050  – – – – – Ita Buttrose  (Chair) 130,025  20,024  – – 150,049  183,100  28,197  – – 211,297  Peter Tonagh  (Deputy Chair) 94,010  10,341  – – 104,351  90,390  9,491  – – 99,881  Fiona Balfour – – – – – 35,169  3,693  – – 38,862  Jane Connors – – – – – 50,242  9,445  – – 59,687  Mario D’Orazio 62,710  6,898  – – 69,608  60,290  6,330  – – 66,620  Joseph Gersh -  -  – – -  50,242  5,275  – – 55,517  Peter Lewis 62,710  9,657  – – 72,367  60,290  9,285  – – 69,575  Nicolette  Maury 44,420  6,841  – – 51,261  – – – – – Louise  McElvogue 44,420  6,841  – – 51,261  – – – – – Georgina  Somerset 62,710  6,898  – – 69,608  60,290  6,330  – – 66,620  Laura Tingle 62,710  9,657  – – 72,367  10,048  1,547  – – 11,595  Total 3,280,043 363,488  86,825  – 3,730,356  3,066,419 345,068  74,001 171,308 3,656,796  Total number  included  above 13  15   197  ===== PAGE 200 ===== Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements  for the year ended 30 June 2024 12.  Key Management Personnel Remuneration (continued) Notes on remuneration a.	 All Executive Managers who were  remunerated in 2023 served for the full  reporting period except as follows:  	– Michael Carrington served in the role of  Director Entertainment and Specialist  from 1 July 2022 to 8 July 2022 (resigned). 	– Judith Whelan served in the role of  Director Regional and Local from  1 July 2022 to 5 February 2023. 	– Chris Oliver-Taylor served in the role of  Chief Content Officer from 20 March 2023  to 30 June 2023. b.	 All Executive Managers who were  remunerated in 2024 served for the full  reporting period. c.	 All Board members who were remunerated  in 2023 served for the full reporting period  except as follows:  	– Fiona Balfour served from 1 July 2022 to  31 January 2023 (resigned). 	– Jane Connors served from 1 July 2022 to  30 April 2023 (term ended). 	– Joseph Gersh served from 1 July 2022 to  10 May 2023 (term ended). 	– Laura Tingle served from 1 May 2023  onwards. d.	 All Board members who were remunerated  in 2024 served for the full reporting period  except as follows:  	– Kim Williams (Chair) served from  7 March 2024 onwards. 	– Ita Buttrose (Chair) resigned 6 March 2024  (term ended). 	– Louise McElvogue served from  16 October 2023 onwards. 	– Nicolette Maury served from  16 October 2023 onwards. e.	 The above table is prepared on an accrual  basis.

The classification depends on the nature  and purpose of the financial assets and is  determined at the time of initial recognition.  Financial assets are recognised and  derecognised upon trade date. The carrying value of financial instruments  specifically excludes the following line  items, illustrated in the reconciliation below.  These items do not fall under the definition of  financial instruments: Notes 2024 $’000 2023 $’000 Total financial assets stated in the Statement of Financial Position  adjusted for: 301,550  363,673  – Net GST receivable from the Australian Taxation Office 6B (6,032) (6,769) Total financial assets classified as financial instruments 295,518  356,904  Total payables and interest bearing liabilities stated in the Statement  of Financial Position adjusted for: 616,992  642,701  – Lease liability 9B (473,143) (507,189) – Salaries and wages (including separation and redundancies) 8B (26,567) (25,631) – Superannuation 8B (4,322) (906) – Unearned revenue 8B (22,054) (22,433) Total financial liabilities classified as financial instruments 90,906  86,542  Effective Interest Method Income is recognised on an effective interest  rate basis except for financial assets  that are recognised at fair value through  surplus/(deficit). The effective interest method is a method of  calculating the amortised cost of a financial  asset and of allocating interest income over  the relevant period. The effective interest rate  is the rate that exactly discounts estimated  future cash receipts through the expected life  of the financial asset, or, where appropriate, a  shorter period. Financial Assets at Fair Value Through Profit  or Loss or surplus/(deficit)  Financial assets are classified as financial  assets at fair value through surplus/(deficit)  where the financial assets: •	 have been acquired principally for the  purpose of selling in the near future; •	 are derivatives (except for derivative  instruments that are designated as, and are  highly effective hedging instruments); or •	 are parts of an identified portfolio of financial  instruments that the Corporation manages  together and have a recent actual pattern  of short-term profit-taking. Forward exchange contracts in this category  are classified as current assets. 202  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 205 ===== Financial assets at fair value through surplus/ (deficit) are stated at fair value, with any  resultant gain or loss recognised in surplus/ (deficit). The net gain or loss recognised in  surplus/(deficit) incorporates any interest  earned on the financial asset. The Corporation’s  financial assets in this category are forward  exchange contracts which are derivative  financial instruments. Gains and losses on these  items are recognised through surplus/(deficit)  except if they are classified as a cash flow  hedge where they are recognised in the hedging  reserve within equity if material in value. Financial Liabilities Financial liabilities, including borrowings,  are initially measured at fair value, net  of transaction costs. These liabilities are  subsequently measured at amortised cost  using the effective interest method, with  interest expense recognised on an effective  interest basis.

Forward exchange contracts are carried as  assets when their net fair value is positive  and as liabilities when their net fair value is  negative. For the purpose of hedge accounting,  the Corporation’s hedges are classified as  cash flow hedges when they hedge exposure  to variability in cash flows that is attributable  either to a particular risk associated with  a recognised asset, liability or to a highly  probable forecast transaction. At the inception of a hedge relationship,  the Corporation formally designates and  documents the hedge relationship to which  the Corporation wishes to apply hedge  accounting and the risk management objective  and strategy for undertaking the hedge.  The documentation includes identification  of the hedging instrument, the hedged item  or transaction, the nature of the risk being  hedged and how the Corporation will assess the  hedging instrument’s effectiveness in offsetting  the exposure to changes in the hedged item’s  fair value or cash flow attributable to the  hedged risk.    203  ===== PAGE 206 ===== Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements  for the year ended 30 June 2024 14.  Financial Instruments (continued) Such hedges are expected to be highly effective  in achieving offsetting changes in fair value  or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing  basis to determine that they have been highly  effective throughout the financial reporting  periods for which they were designated. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the  cash flow hedge, where material, is recognised  directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is  recognised in surplus/(deficit). Immaterial gains  and losses on cash flow hedges are recognised  in surplus/(deficit). Amounts taken to equity are transferred to  surplus/(deficit) when the hedged transaction  affects the surplus/(deficit), such as when  hedged income or expenses are recognised  or when a forecast sale or purchase occurs.  When the hedged item is the cost of a  non‑financial asset or liability, the amounts  taken to equity are transferred to the initial  carrying amount of the non-financial asset  or liability. If the forecast transaction is no  longer expected to occur, amounts previously  recognised in equity are transferred to surplus/ (deficit). If the hedging instrument expires  or is sold, terminated, or exercised without  replacement or rollover, or if its designation  as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously  recognised in equity remain until the forecast  transaction occurs. If the related transaction  is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to  surplus/(deficit). 14C  Financial Risk Management The Corporation’s financial risk management  policies and procedures are established to  identify and analyse the risks faced by the  Corporation, to set appropriate risk limits and  controls to monitor risks and adherence to  limits. The Corporation’s policies are reviewed  regularly to reflect changes in the Corporation’s  activities. There has been no change in the  policies from the previous year. Compliance  with policies and exposure limits are reviewed  by the Corporation’s internal auditors on a  regular basis. To meet the Corporation’s regular financial  risk management objectives, surplus cash  is invested in short-term, highly liquid term  deposits with maturities at acquisition date of  greater than three months. These term deposits  are included as other receivables. The Corporation’s Treasury function provides  advice and services to the business,  coordinates access to foreign currency  contracts and monitors and assesses the  financial risks relating to the operations of  the Corporation through internal risk reports.  Where appropriate, the Corporation seeks to  minimise the effects of its financial risks by  using derivative financial instruments to hedge  risk exposures. The use of financial derivatives  is governed by the Corporation’s policies, which  provide written principles on foreign exchange  risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives  and investment of funds. The Corporation does  not enter into or trade financial instruments for  speculative purposes. Under Section 25B of the Australian  Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983, the  Corporation’s Foreign Exchange Policy is  conducted to reduce or eliminate risk on  the Corporation’s known exposures and  activities and is recorded under accepted  accounting standards. The Corporation’s aims, by entering into foreign  currency hedging arrangements, are outlined  in Note 4 Own Source Income under the heading  Foreign currency transactions. 14D  Fair Values of Financial Instruments Forward exchange contracts  The fair value of forward exchange contracts  is taken to be the unrealised gain or loss at  balance date calculated by reference to current  forward exchange rates for contracts with  similar maturity profiles. At 30 June 2024 this  was a net payable of $32,000 (2023 receivable  of $134,000). 204  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 207 ===== The fair values of financial instruments that are  not traded in an active market (such as over- the-counter derivatives) are determined using  Level 2 inputs based on the forward exchange  rates at the end of the reporting period using  assumptions that are reflective of market  conditions at the end of each reporting period. Loans  The fair values of any long-term borrowings are  estimated using discounted cash flow analysis,  based on current interest rates for liabilities  with similar risk profiles.  14E  Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will  default on its contractual obligations resulting  in financial loss to the Corporation. Credit  risk arises from the financial assets of the  Corporation, which comprise cash and cash  equivalents, trade and other receivables, short  term deposits and derivative instruments. The Corporation has a policy of only dealing  with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining  collateral where appropriate, as a means  of mitigating the risk of financial loss from  defaults. The Corporation assesses credit  ratings through independent ratings agencies  and if not available, uses publicly available  financial information and its own trading record  to rate customers.  The Corporation manages its credit risk by  undertaking credit checks on customers who  wish to take on credit terms. The Corporation  has policies that set limits for each individual  customer. Ongoing credit evaluations are  performed on the financial condition of  accounts receivable. The Corporation has no  material concentration of credit risk with any  single customer as the Corporation has a large  number of customers spread across a range of  industries and geographical areas. The credit risk arising from dealings in financial  instruments is controlled by a strict policy  of credit approvals, limits and monitoring  procedures. Credit exposure is controlled  by counterparty limits that are reviewed  and approved by the Board of Directors.  The Corporation does not have any significant  credit risk exposure to any single counterparty.  The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative  financial instruments is limited because the  counterparties are banks with credit ratings of  at least A- as assigned by Standard & Poor’s. The Corporation’s maximum exposure to credit  risk at reporting date in relation to each class  of recognised financial assets is the carrying  amount, net of the expected credit loss  provision, of those assets as indicated in the  Statement of Financial Position. Credit exposure of foreign currency and interest  rate bearing term deposits is represented by the  net fair value of the contracts. 14F  Hedging Instruments  Foreign Exchange Hedges The Corporation enters into non-speculative  forward exchange contracts to cover foreign  currency payments. The following table sets out  the gross value to be received under forward  exchange contracts outstanding at the end of  the reporting period.

It is trusted by the Australian people  to inform, entertain and educate them, tell  their stories, and hold power to account on  their behalf. For more than nine decades the ABC has built  the trust of its audiences by maintaining the  highest editorial standards of any media  organisation in Australia. To fulfil its Charter, the ABC must create  innovative and challenging content and pursue  strong public interest journalism. In doing so,  the ABC will at times cause offence, discomfort,  even outrage. Brave public broadcasting can  ruffle feathers. It can also bring people together,  reflect the nation back to itself, disinfect  with sunlight, and give a platform to diverse  communities and perspectives. This Code of Practice sets out the fundamental  standards the ABC must adhere to in order  to prioritise and strengthen the trust of its  audiences. They are drawn from the ABC  Editorial Policies, a detailed handbook for  journalists and content makers available in full  at abc.net.au/edpols. The Code of Practice represents the ABC’s  public commitment to high standards. It serves  as a promise to audiences of what they can  expect of their national public broadcaster. It also serves as a promise of rigorous  accountability to the Australian public. The  ABC will engage with feedback and complaints  in good faith, reflect on its performance, and  respect the decisions of the ABC Ombudsman’s  Office and the Australian Communications and  Media Authority (ACMA). Scope This Code of Practice has been developed by  the ABC and notified to the ACMA as required  by section 8(e) of the Australian Broadcasting  Corporation Act 1983. By law, the ACMA has the  power to investigate complaints alleging that  content on an ABC broadcasting service has  failed to comply with the Code of Practice, if the  complainant has first complained directly to  the ABC and has not received a response within  60 days or is dissatisfied with the response  they received. Accordingly, the Code of Practice applies to all  content broadcast by the ABC on its free-to-air  domestic television and radio broadcasting  services. It does not apply to the ABC’s digital  media services. Like all ABC content, those  services are subject to the comprehensive  principles and standards set out in the wider  ABC Editorial Policies. Interpretation The Code of Practice is to be interpreted  and applied: •	 with due consideration of the relevant  principles outlined in the Editorial Policies,  and any associated guidance notes; •	 with due regard for the nature of the content  under consideration in particular cases; and •	 in ways that maintain independence and  integrity, preserve trust and do not unduly  constrain journalistic enquiry or artistic  expression.   215  ===== PAGE 218 ===== Code of Practice Accuracy The ABC will make reasonable efforts to ensure  that material facts are accurate and presented  in context. Impartiality The ABC will gather and present news and  information with due impartiality. Fair and honest dealing Participants in ABC content will normally  be informed of the general nature of their  participation. Where allegations are made  about a person or organisation, the ABC will  make reasonable efforts in the circumstances  to provide a fair opportunity to respond. Privacy Intrusion by the ABC into a person’s private  life without consent must be justified in the  public interest and the extent of the intrusion  must be limited to what is proportionate in  the circumstances. Harm and offence ABC content that is likely to cause harm or  offence must be justified by the editorial  context. Where content is likely to cause harm  or offence, having regard to the context, the  ABC will make reasonable efforts to provide  information about the nature of the content  through the use of classification labels or  other warnings or advice. Children and young people The ABC will take due care over the dignity and  physical and emotional welfare of children  and young people (under the age of 18) who  are involved in making, participating in and  presenting content we produce or commission.  Before significant participation of a child  or young person in content we produce or  commission, or in interactive services we offer,  the ABC will consider whether it is appropriate  to obtain the consent of both the child/young  person and the parent/guardian. Classification The ABC will ensure all domestic broadcast  television programs – with the exception of  news, current affairs and sporting events – are  classified G, PG, M or MA15+ in accordance  with the guidelines below. More details,  including time zone charts setting out when  programs of each classification are permitted  on each channel, are available at abc.net.au/ classification. G – GENERAL Themes: The treatment of themes should be  discreet, justified by context, and very mild in  impact. The presentation of dangerous, imitable  behaviour is not permitted except in those  circumstances where it is justified by context.  Any depiction of such behaviour must not  encourage dangerous imitation. Violence: Violence may be very discreetly  implied, but should: •	 have a light tone, or •	 have a very low sense of threat or menace,  and •	 be infrequent, and •	 not be gratuitous. Sex: Sexual activity should: •	 only be suggested in very discreet visual  or verbal references, and •	 be infrequent, and •	 not be gratuitous. Artistic or cultural depictions of nudity in  a sexual context may be permitted if the  treatment is discreet, justified by context, and  very mild in impact. Language: Coarse language should: •	 be very mild and infrequent, and •	 not be gratuitous. Drug Use: The depiction of the use of legal drugs  should be handled with care. Illegal drug use  should be implied only very discreetly and be  justified by context. 216  AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2024  ===== PAGE 219 ===== Nudity: Nudity outside of a sexual context  should be: •	 infrequent, and •	 not detailed, and •	 not gratuitous.

Nudity: Nudity outside of a sexual context  should not be detailed or gratuitous. M – MATURE (Recommended for people aged 15 years  and over) Themes: Most themes can be dealt with, but the  treatment should be discreet and the impact  should not be strong. Violence: Generally, depictions of  violence should: •	 not contain a lot of detail, and •	 not be prolonged. In realistic treatments, depictions of violence  that contain detail should: •	 be infrequent, and •	 not have a strong impact, and •	 not be gratuitous. In stylised treatments, depictions of violence  may contain more detail and be more frequent  if this does not increase the impact. Verbal and visual references to sexual violence  may only be included if they are: •	 discreet and infrequent, and •	 strongly justified by the narrative or  documentary context. Sex: Sexual activity may be discreetly implied. Nudity in a sexual context should not contain  a lot of detail or be prolonged. Verbal references to sexual activity may be  more detailed than depictions if this does not  increase the impact. Language: Coarse language may be used. Generally, coarse language that is stronger,  detailed or very aggressive should: •	 be infrequent, and •	 not be gratuitous. Drug Use: Drug use may be discreetly shown. Drug use should not be promoted or  encouraged. Nudity: Nudity outside of a sexual context may  be shown but depictions that contain any detail  should not be gratuitous.   217  ===== PAGE 220 ===== MA15+ – MATURE AUDIENCE (Not suitable for people under 15 years) Themes: The treatment of themes with a high  degree of intensity should not be gratuitous.  Violence: Generally, depictions of violence  should not have a high impact. In realistic treatments, detailed depictions of  violence with a strong impact should: •	 be infrequent, and •	 not be prolonged, and •	 not be gratuitous. Depictions of violence in stylised treatments  may be more detailed and more frequent if this  does not increase the impact. Depictions of sexual violence are permitted only  if they are not frequent, prolonged, gratuitous  or exploitative. Sex: Sexual activity may be implied. Depictions of nudity in a sexual context which  contain detail should not be exploitative.  Verbal references may be more detailed than  depictions if this does not increase the impact.  Language: Coarse language may be used. Coarse language that is very strong, aggressive  or detailed should not be gratuitous.  Drug Use: Drug use may be shown but should not  be promoted or encouraged. More detailed depictions should not have a high  degree of impact.  Nudity: Nudity should be justified by context.

Complaints must be submitted to the ABC in the  first instance.

Commonwealth entities are required to present  remuneration for key management personnel,  senior executives, and other highly paid staff, as  defined in the PGPA Rule. Key management personnel Key management personnel (KMP) are those  persons having authority and responsibility for  planning, directing and controlling the activities  of the entity, directly or indirectly, including any  director (whether executive or otherwise) of that  entity. The Corporation determined KMP as the  members of the Board, the Managing Director,  the Chief Content Officer, the Director News and  the Chief Financial Officer. Senior executives Senior executives are employees employed in a  position equivalent to classification Groups 9 to  11 of the table in Schedule 1 of the Public Service  Classification Rules 2000. The Corporation  determined senior executives as executive  directors who are not KMP (Senior Executives).  Other highly paid staff Other highly paid staff are employees who  are neither KMP nor senior executive and  whose total remuneration paid during the year  exceeded $250,000 (Other Highly Paid Staff). Total remuneration Total remuneration is defined in the PGPA rule  as the sum of the following (calculated on an  accrual basis): •	 Base salary; •	 Performance pay and bonuses; •	 Other benefits and allowances; •	 Superannuation contributions (made by the  employer); •	 Long service leave; •	 Other long-term benefits; •	 Termination benefits. Executive and employee  remuneration policy At the core of the ABC’s approach to  remuneration is a need to ensure the  Corporation can realise its strategic priorities  through an ability to attract and retain  employees who deliver on its priorities and  deliver value for audiences into the future.   221  ===== PAGE 224 ===== Remuneration principles  Remuneration framework Equitable We ensure our  remuneration  approach is consistent  and equitable Market competitive We attract and retain  the best talent to meet  our current and future  workforce needs Performance aligned We recognise and  reward contribution  to performance goals  and targets Transparent We have a transparent  and disciplined  approach to managing  remuneration  decisions and costs  Fixed remuneration  At risk remuneration  Element Fixed remuneration comprises  base salary, superannuation,  and benefits. The ABC removed at risk pay as an element of remuneration  for executive KMP, senior executives and other highly paid  staff with effect from 1 January 2021.  The Commonwealth Remuneration Tribunal has consented  to the removal of at risk pay from the position of Managing  Director (MD). Performance Reviewed annually to reflect  the experience, competence  and contribution of individuals  whilst remaining conservatively  competitive against the market. Some other highly paid staff are eligible to receive a one off  bonus payment in lieu of a salary increase, for exceptional  performance in accordance with the ABC Enterprise  Agreement 2022–25.  Alignment Attracts and retains the best talent to meet the ABC’s strategic priorities.

Remuneration and other terms of employment  are formalised as follows:  •	 executive KMP and senior executives  (executives): Individual employment  agreement. •	 other highly paid staff: Individual employment  agreement or engaged through either the  ABC Senior Employment Agreement 2016 or  the ABC Enterprise Agreement 2022–25. During the year ended 30 June 2024, the ABC’s  People & Sustainability Committee (PSC)  assisted the Board in fulfilling its governance  responsibilities in relation to remuneration.  Outlined below is the ABC’s approach for  setting, monitoring and approving remuneration  policy and amounts. Note that the Managing  Director’s (MD) remuneration arrangements  are set by the Commonwealth Remuneration  Tribunal (the Tribunal). Non-executive director (NED)  remuneration The Australian Broadcasting Corporation  Act 1983 (Cth) makes provision for NEDs to be  appointed via a Nomination Panel. The Commonwealth Remuneration Tribunal,  an independent statutory body overseeing the  remuneration of key Commonwealth offices,  determines fees for all ABC NEDs. The ABC  is required to comply with the Tribunal’s  determinations and plays no role in the  consideration or determination of NED fees.  The Tribunal sets annual Chair, Deputy Chair  and Board Member fees (exclusive of statutory  superannuation contributions) which are  inclusive of all activities undertaken by  NEDs on behalf of the ABC (that is, inclusive  of Committee participation). Statutory  superannuation is paid in addition to the fees  set by the Tribunal.  The Commonwealth Remuneration Tribunal  determination for the period ending 30 June  2024 set the following ABC Board fees:  •	 Chair: $190,430 •	 Deputy Chair: $94,010 •	 Member: $62,710 MD PSC ABC Board 	 Recommend Executive KPIs 	 Review and recommend Executive  remuneration structures and incentive  plans, policies and practices including any  changes to those plans, to the Board 	 Review  and approve  recommendations  referred by the  PSC 	 Evaluate and provide recommendations  regarding remuneration structures and  incentive plans for Executives, including  any changes to those structures or  plans 	 Review and recommend MD remuneration  in line with the remuneration  arrangements set by the Tribunal 	 Approve Executive remuneration with  respect to individual remuneration  arrangements, KPIs, performance  assessments and remuneration  outcomes 	 Approve performance assessments  and remuneration outcomes for Other  Highly Paid Staff, as recommended by  ABC managers   223  ===== PAGE 226 ===== Key management personnel remuneration  Name Position title Short-term benefits Post- employment  benefits Other long-term  benefits Termination  benefits Total  remuneration Base  salary Bonuses Other  benefits and  allowances Superannuation  contributions Long  service  leave Other  long- term  benefits Executives David  Anderson Managing  Director 974,069 150,491 34,933 1,159,493 Melanie  Kleyn Chief Financial  Officer 584,362 27,399 21,810 633,571 Chris Oliver  Taylor Chief Content  Officer 637,138 27,399 8,207 672,744 Justin  Stevens Director, News 460,354 74,397 21,875 556,626 Kim Williams Chair 60,405 6,645 67,050 Ita Buttrose Chair 130,025 20,024 150,049 Peter Tonagh Deputy Chair 94,010 10,341 104,351 Mario  D’Orazio Director 62,710 6,898 69,608 Peter Lewis Director 62,710 9,657 72,367 Nicolette  Maury Director 44,420 6,841 51,261 Louise  McElvogue Director 44,420 6,841 51,261 Georgina  Somerset Director 62,710 6,898 69,608 Laura Tingle Staff Elected  Director 62,710 9,657 72,367 Notes on remuneration 1.
