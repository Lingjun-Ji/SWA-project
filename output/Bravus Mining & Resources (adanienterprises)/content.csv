AS IN SPORTS... “All you have to do is to dream big   and try to fulﬁl it.” Kapil Dev BREAKING ALL RECORDS  ===== PAGE 3 ===== Mount Everest, the world's highest mountain Mountains symbolise trust  and truthfulness, strength  and stillness, constancy and  courage. In this publication, we  have drawn our inspiration from  the mountains, and paid our  humble homage to the world's  highest mountains. While storms can flatten structures and cyclones can destroy cities,  they cannot do anything to mountains. Mountains remain unmoved and unaffected. From one peak to another,  they continue to rise higher and higher. And as they rise, they emerge stronger. We also faced a severe man-made storm recently – one that would have  destroyed most businesses. But, under the visionary leadership of our Chairman,   we remained unyielding like a mountain. We kept building inner strength by: With untiring learning, we made the biggest comeback in the  history of corporate India with our strongest performance ever. We continue to rise higher and higher, and emerge Stronger Than Ever Our unceasing  commitment to  governance and  compliance Our unwavering   focus on  sustainability and  impact creation Our unending  endeavour to   trust and  transparency  ===== PAGE 4 ===== Introduction to The Report  This is Adani Enterprises Limited’s (Adani Enterprises or  AEL) first Integrated Report, showcasing our efforts to  provide holistic information and create long-term value  for our stakeholders.

In the face  of an unprecedented challenge and widespread scrutiny, our journey  epitomised the essence of the spirit that has always defined us and has  allowed us to consistently turn setbacks into comebacks. In 2023, we  showed our unbreakable spirit and proved that challenges could not  weaken us; instead they became a testament to our ability to emerge  stronger than ever. As most of you know, we faced baseless accusations made by a  U.S.‑based short-seller that threatened to cast a shadow on our  reputation and decades of hard work. Typical short-selling targets financial markets. This was far more  insidious. It was a two-pronged attack, simultaneously targeting  our financial standing and dragging us into the political arena. The  onslaught was a calculated strike two days before the closing of our  Follow-on Public Offer (FPO). Amplified by a segment of complicit media,  it was designed to defame us, inflict maximum damage and erode our  hard-earned market value. We were, therefore, faced with a multi-dimensional crisis. Despite  successfully raising ` 20,000 crore through the FPO, we made the  extraordinary decision to return the proceeds. This historic move  underscored our unwavering dedication to our investors and our  commitment to ethical business practices. Amidst the challenges, our liquidity became our greatest asset.  Augmenting our cash reserves, we raised approximately ` 40,000 crore  more, comfortably covering the next two years of our debt repayment.  This decisive action is a testament to the strength of your company. It  restored market confidence, and we safeguarded our portfolio against  any volatility by pre-paying ` 17,500 crore in margin-linked financing. Despite never having faced any challenges with debt repayments while  operating in the inherently leveraged infrastructure sector, we dropped  our Debt to EBIDTA ratio to 2.5x in just six months from 3.3x at the end of  Dear Shareholder,  This year marks a monumental milestone – our 30th anniversary. It is a time  to look back and celebrate the incredible journey of Adani Enterprises,  from its humble IPO in 1994 to the heights we have reached today. I am  immensely grateful for what we have achieved together. Your unwavering  support and trust have fuelled our transformation and allowed us to emerge  stronger than ever with the wherewithal to overcome every obstacle that  has come our way. Every challenge   we have faced has made us more resilient.  Our journey  epitomised the  essence of the  spirit that has  always defined us  and has allowed  us to consistently  turn setbacks  into comebacks. Amidst the challenges,  our liquidity became  our greatest asset.  Augmenting our  cash reserves, we  raised approximately  E 40,000 crore more,  comfortably covering the  next two years of our  debt repayment. 20 21 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 Strategic Review Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 15 ===== March 2023. It is now at 2.2x. We should keep in mind that five years ago,  this ratio stood at 7x. This approach not only strengthens our financial  resilience but also increases our capacity for future expansion. We were further vindicated when the Supreme Court of India affirmed  our actions, and our commitment to operational excellence and  transparent disclosures was validated not only by rating agencies and the  well-informed financial community but also by respected global investors.  Partners like GQG Partners (U.S.), TotalEnergies Limited (Europe), IHC and  QIA (Middle East), and even the U.S. Development Finance Corporation  (DFC) stood firmly by our side, signalling unwavering confidence  in our integrity. The fact is that the spirit to fight back, the courage to stand up, and the  will to overcome makes us stronger than ever. The storms that tested us  became the very ones that fuelled our strength. India’s Moment: Navigating Complexity, Seizing Opportunity The world stands at a crossroads. Geopolitical tensions strain  relationships, the fight against climate change grows more challenging,  and technological change disrupts the way we live and work. Amidst this  uncertainty, a powerful light shines – the undeniable rise of India. India stands at a pivotal moment. A period where circumstances tilt in its  favour, and decisive action can propel decades of growth and prosperity.  Our nation is witnessing something extraordinary: a self-reinforcing  cycle of progress. Growth feeds growth. India’s trajectory is shaped by an  exceptional time where opportunity and decisive action converge. This is  evidenced by powerful metrics: a remarkable growth rate, declining fiscal  and current account deficits, surging exports, controlled inflation, and  rising income levels. These forces intertwine with declining poverty and  expanding consumption, feeding corporate strength and slashing bank  NPAs. This self-reinforcing cycle of progress is fuelled by domestic demand  and amplified by global investors seeking stability and diversification,  leading to record FDI inflows further bolstering the economy at a time of  global insecurity. The foundation of much of India’s success rests in the clarity, consistency,  and compassion of the government. Its focus on the welfare of the  common citizen is transformative. Schemes like Direct Benefit Transfer,  eliminating over 100 million fraudulent accounts and saving an astounding  ` 3 lakh crore from misuse, Ayushman Bharat, saving the poor an estimated  ` 1 lakh crore in healthcare expenses, the Prime Minister Ujjwala Yojana,  providing clean cooking solutions to over 10 crore underserved citizens, or  the Jal Jeevan Mission, which aims to supply 55 litres of water per person  per day to every rural household, are more than just programmes – they  are pillars of social progress that act as safeguards for the health and  dignity of millions of our people. This trust in government emboldens the  people and fuels their ambition. It is this platform, established over the past decade, that has made India  the world’s fastest-growing major economy, a nation of scale, vision, and  heart. In addition to the domestic success, its rising geopolitical stature  and principled global engagement positions India as a leading force for  stability and progress during a tumultuous time as seen through initiatives  like the G20 presidency. This is India’s moment. We are now the force for stability, cooperation,  and progress in a complex world bolstered by vast domestic demand and  propelled by the government’s ambitious USD 2 trillion infrastructure  investment target by 2030. We, as a company, recognise this exceptional moment and that our  ambitions are not just our own; they are interwoven with India’s  emergence as a true global power. India shines, and we shine with it. Hum Karke Dikhate Hai: The Philosophy for Our Success India’s robust macroeconomic stability and ambitious growth plans inspire  unwavering confidence in our future. The pivotal role of public-private  partnerships in infrastructure development, fuelled by strong multiplier  effects, reinforces our belief. The nation’s infrastructure spending has  tripled in the past decade, with breakneck progress in highways, railways,  and electrification. Initiatives like Gati Shakti will integrate infrastructure  schemes (Bharatmala, Sagarmala, etc.) to drive logistics costs below 10%,  bolstering competitiveness, and we are very well positioned to capitalise  on such programmes. This infrastructure push, combined with policies like Make in India and  Production-Linked Incentive Schemes, will drive investment across  vital sectors – roads, airports, ports, power, railways, and data centers,  each of these are core businesses for the Adani Group. As India’s  leading infrastructure player, we see a clear narrative of immense and  predictable growth. Our record-breaking achievements in 2023 underscore our alignment with  national priorities and our ability to execute the most complex, largescale  projects with unmatched expertise. Picture our Khavda Renewable Energy Park, the world’s largest RE plant  spanning several hundreds of square kilometres. Already generating  2,000 MW of clean energy, our aggressive timeline aims to develop 30 GW  capacity in the next five years, enough to power nations like Belgium,  Chile, and Switzerland. For us, this RE park is a symbol of our commitment  to sustainability and a symbol of national pride. In the spirit of sustainability, Adani Green became the proud sponsor of  London Science Museum’s stunning green energy gallery that looks at the  past, present and future of energy systems. It is now considered one of the  foremost museums that showcases how the world can generate and use  energy more sustainably. It has quickly become a one-of-its-kind platform  drawing and inspiring thousands of global visitors to understand solutions  for an equitable and sustainable future. Portfolio-level   Net Debt to EBIDTA  ratio in FY 2023-24 2.2x Government of  India's infrastructure  investment target by 2030 USD 2 trillion  India’s trajectory  is shaped by an  exceptional time  where opportunity  and decisive action  converge. This  is evidenced by  powerful metrics: a  remarkable growth  rate, declining fiscal  and current account  deficits, surging  exports, controlled  inflation, and  rising income levels. Our record-breaking  achievements in  2023 underscore  our alignment with  national priorities  and our ability to  execute the most  complex, largescale  projects with  unmatched expertise. 22 23 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 Strategic Review Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 16 ===== Or envision the cutting-edge Ammunition and Missile Complex, South  Asia’s largest, a testament to our commitment to India’s security. Picture  the Drishti 10 Starliner UAV, a symbol of Indian innovation, soaring through  the skies, protecting our nation. These aren’t just machines; they embody  our unwavering dedication to India’s well-being. Further, visualise the world’s largest slum at Dharavi in Maharashtra  as we redevelop it over the next decade to provide dignity to over its  1 million residents. This is not a project of redevelopment; it’s about  dignity of living. And we did not stop there. We were privileged to have the Honourable Prime Minister inaugurate the  state-of-the-art Terminal T3 at the Chaudhary Charan Singh International  Airport in Lucknow, designed to accommodate 8 million passengers  annually and enhance domestic and international connectivity. Kutch Copper Limited, a pioneering project in Mundra, commenced  operations at its greenfield copper refinery. By the end of this decade,  we aim to make it the world’s largest single-location copper smelter with  a capacity of 1 MTPA, significantly enhancing India’s self-reliance on a  crucial metal needed for several critical industries. Adani Ports experienced an exceptional year, exceeding 400 MMT of  cargo for the first time and handling a record 420 MMT as it continued  to expand its position as India’s premier commercial port with significant  double-digit growth across most facilities. The U.S. Development Finance Corporation injected USD 553 million into  CWIT, Adani’s joint venture in Sri Lanka, to develop a deepwater shipping  container terminal at Colombo Port. This investment is a strategic step  showcasing the confidence of the DFC on Adani’s capabilities as well  as towards bolstering Sri Lanka’s economic recovery through private  sector-led initiatives. Following the strategic acquisition of ACC and Ambuja Cements and  the successful commissioning of our Ametha Integrated Unit, the Adani  Group’s combined cement capacity has risen from 67 MTPA to 78.9 MTPA.  This puts us well on the path towards the 140 MTPA target we had set to  achieve by 2028. Also, we are proud to state that Ambuja Cements was  the lead supplier for the breathtaking Mumbai Trans Harbour Link, India’s  longest sea bridge covering 21.8 km that showcases its infrastructural  prowess. Our approach is clear – align with the nation, build adjacencies,  and de-risk through integration. Today, we stand as a testament to India’s  growth trajectory. We consistently take on projects of immense scale  that others wouldn’t dream of, proving our ability to deliver complex  infrastructure that will fuel the nation’s rise and most importantly continue  to ensure that we do so without compromising on our growth and financial  numbers. This is best manifested in the all-round growth numbers we  delivered in 2023-24. Financial Performance: An All-Time Record In terms of financial performance, I am delighted to state that we  achieved an unprecedented milestone, recording the highest-ever EBITDA  of ` 82,917 crore (roughly USD 10 billion), a remarkable surge of 45%.  This exceptional financial performance drove our PAT to a record high  of ` 40,129 crore, marking a substantial 70.8% growth. Our net Debt to  EBITDA further fell to 2.2x from 3.3x over the past year, giving us additional  headroom for future growth. All of this resulted in an all-time‑high levels of  liquidity for the Group with a cash balance of ` 59,791 crore. These consistent and improved metrics demonstrate our highly stable  infrastructure platform, and led to a series of rating and outlook  upgrades. Three of our portfolio companies – Ambuja, ACC, and APSEZ,  are now AAA rated.

Highlighting the performance of a few of our companies: AEL As the incubation engine for the Group, AEL had a stellar year  with three of our incubating businesses, including airports,  green hydrogen eco-system and roads, picking up momentum.  Passenger traffic at our airports witnessed a strong double-digit  growth and stands at 88.6 million passengers. The solar  manufacturing division has successfully commissioned a  large-sized monocrystalline ingot and wafer unit, India’s first,  further enhancing control over the fully integrated green  hydrogen production chain. APSEZ In addition to reaching 420 MMT and 10 of our ports recording  lifetime high cargo volumes, we undertook successful acquisitions  of Gopalpur and Karaikal ports.  AGEL Given the RE growth potential, we revised our FY 2029-30  target from 45 GW to 50 GW. In the year, we added 2.8 GW, 15%  of India’s total renewable capacity addition. This includes the  commissioning of the first 2 GW at the world’s largest RE park at  Khavda within 12 months of breaking ground, which highlights our  execution capabilities.  APL Our operating capacity increased by 12% to 15,250 MW, with  the commissioning of the 1,600 MW Godda ultra-supercritical  thermal power plant.  24 25 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 Strategic Review Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 17 ===== Through the Adani Saksham (skill development) initiative, we empowered  1,69,000 young individuals with essential skills, helping them secure a  brighter future and potentially become entrepreneurs.

Our water conservation initiatives created a staggering 13.8 million cubic  meters of storage capacity, ensuring water security and supporting the  ecological balance of our ecosystems. The engagement of 16,900 women in self-help groups underlined our  initiative for sustainable economic development, empowering them to  become agents of change in their communities. At the Adani Foundation, each number tells a story of change, of a life  empowered, and a community revitalised. These stories fuel our mission to  continue making a significant and sustainable impact, and I am proud of  what we have achieved together as we strive to do our part to leave a small  positive mark on this world. A Shared Destiny: Stronger than Ever and Building a  Nation Together The challenges we overcame last year have strengthened our resolve.  We draw inspiration from the very resilience that India embodies. Our  ambitions are limitless, just like India’s. We see a future where our expertise  drives infrastructure revolutions, where our green energy initiatives  power a sustainable tomorrow, and where our commitment to upliftment  transforms communities.  The road ahead is paved with extraordinary possibilities and I can promise  you that the Adani Group today is stronger than it’s ever been.

These results validated the Company’s inherent  robustness, which enabled us to stay on course with our growth momentum  in the face of the Hindenburg short-selling allegations, as well as the  external inflationary and market pressures that hit the world at a time  businesses and industries were still recovering from the impact of the  Covid pandemic. Far from putting our plans and projects on hold, these  developments actually motivated us to push back aggressively to stay on  the path of growth and value creation. As a result, the journey on which we  had embarked not long ago to partner India’s efforts to become self-reliant  and sustainable became even bigger and better during the year. In line with our strategic focus on incubating new and emerging businesses,  the emerging core infra businesses of the green hydrogen ecosystem,  airports and roads showed strong operational performance, contributing  25% to the overall income and 45% to the consolidated EBITDA of Adani  Enterprises. The total income of these three businesses went up sharply by  over 66% to 24,510 crore during the fiscal, with EBITDA and profit before  tax increasing by 47% and 104% over the previous year. In the ANIL green hydrogen ecosystem, our target of 10 GW of green  hydrogen integrated manufacturing ecosystem continued to progress  well. On our endeavor to backward integration, we have successfully  commissioned India's first ingot and wafer line of 2 GW capacity for our  existing 4 GW solar module line. We are also in the process of ramping  up our recently commissioned wind manufacturing, in which we have  already supplied 54 sets and have an order book of 254 sets. Another  notable highlight of this business was the letter of award received from  Solar Energy Corporation of India for setting up annual electrolyser  manufacturing capacity of 198.5 MW. With these developments, we have  taken many steps forward in our fully integrated approach, which lends us a  strong advantage in end-to-end planning, granting us superior control over  the final product and its cost. Apart from the unprecedented scale of the  business, which we shall continue to build on, this is going to be a leading  source of clean, sustainable and affordable alternative energy. Our airports portfolio also took major strides in its plans to become the  country’s largest and most experiential airport ecosystem. We added  42 new routes, 20 new airlines, as the passenger movement across our  seven operational airports went up by 19% to 88.6 million over the year.  Encouraged by this exponential growth, we are now eying further growth  in annual passenger movement at our airports, which we are focused  FY 2023-24 was a tough and challenging year for all of us in the Adani Group.   The flagship company of Adani Portfolio, and the biggest contributor to the  Group's revenues, succumbing to the malicious onslaught unleashed by the  Hindenburg report was not an option. We knew we had to continue doing  business as usual if we had to come out of the travails and tribulations of this  period unscathed. It gives me immense pleasure to state that not only we  managed to stay undeterred by the spiteful propaganda but also we succeeded  in emerging stronger than ever. We have delivered on all our promises and  commitments for the year, with many operational milestones and stellar numbers.  These achievements reflect our strong strategic and execution capabilities while  underscoring the future value and growth potential of our business. We succeeded  in emerging  stronger  than ever. We have captured some  of the key highlights  of the year in our  first ever integrated  annual report, which  stands testimony to our  efforts to continually  enhance our stakeholder  communication in  line with the evolving  external eco-system. 28 29 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 Strategic Review Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 19 ===== on making the best in the world. We are also set to operationalise the  greenfield Navi Mumbai airport by FY25. Further, we have commenced  Phase I of the city-side development across 98 acres of land at five airports. We believe that the completion of our ongoing works will further augment  our competitive edge in this segment, which is expected to witness  exceptional growth over the next few years. We believe that we will be  growing faster than India in our airports portfolio, just as we had done  previously in the ports business. It is estimated that India will see a 6x  jump in the overall passenger traffic in the next 10 years, and, given our  fast-paced expansion and robust capabilities in on-time execution of  large-scale projects, we are ideally placed to harness this humongous  opportunity. Our growth in this sector is also well aligned to our strategic  development of strong B2C business, which is being effectively aided by  Adani One app, launched through Adani Digital last year. I would also like to share at this point that Adani Airport achieved 57%  energy consumption from Renewable Energy sources during the year, while  our Ahmedabad and Thiruvananthapuram International Airports received  the Environmental Excellence Awards 2023. These achievements underline  our strong commitment to promoting sustainable growth. Coming to our third core emerging infra business of roads, we have made  significant progress in this segment too, with 4 out of our 10 under  construction road projects now more than 70% complete, in line with our  target schedule. Our data center business is also going strong, with the total order book for  AdaniConneX currently standing at 210 MW from hyperscale and enterprise  customers. The construction works at the Noida and Hyderabad data  centers are also going well, and we expect to complete Phase I of both the  Data Centers by FY25. During the year, AdaniConneX sealed the largest  data center financing deal in India with a USD 213 million Construction  Financing Facility. With the data center sector getting a sustained push  from the Indian government through its ‘Digital India’ campaign, emphasis  on data protection and localisation, we are ready to seize the burgeoning  opportunity expected to unfold in this segment in the coming years. We  plan to build data centers across the country and have set for ourselves the  ambitious target of developing 1 GW capacity over the next decade. In the  water portfolio, we achieved commercial operation data certificate for the  Prayagraj water project, emphasising our core strengths and our ambition to  build a strong business in this segment. In terms of our primary industry incubation, we have successfully  operationalised the single location greenfield copper plant at Mundra,  Gujarat in March 2024. The state-of-the-art 500 KTPA plant in Mundra  SEZ has the flexibility to expand to 1,000 KTPA, and is the world's largest  single-location copper manufacturing plant. Aimed at reducing the  country’s dependence on imports and propel its energy transition, the  project leverages Adani Group’s strong position in resource trading, logistics,  renewable power, and infrastructure. As far as our other primary businesses go, they continued to grow at  a steady pace during the year, the mining services production volume  increased to 32.5 MMT and dispatch quantities increased to 30.9 MMT.  In our integrated resource management (IRM) business, where we are  the number one player in the country, we continued to develop business  relationships with diversified customers across various end-user industries.  Our endeavour in this business is to maintain our leadership position and  we shall continue to take the necessary steps for the same. The Carmichael mine in Australia, under our commercial mining business,  witnessed a whopping increase of 47% in production, with shipment  growing by 52%, during the year. Our focus during FY 2023-24 was on keeping the morale of our people  high and ensuring that we do not deviate with our plans and ambitions. I  am happy to share that we were successful on both these counts. We also  continued to attract and retain the best talent in the industry through  impactful internal communication and other people-centric initiatives. In line with our commitment to strengthening our ESG focus, we also  continued to invest in our ESG initiatives to aid India’s journey towards  decarbonisation and net zero. I am proud to share that our score of  49/100 in the DJSI-S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment was  significantly better than the industry average of 20/100. This ranking  underscores our commitment to ESG, as reflected in the marked shift  towards renewable energy (RE) consumption across the key business  segments. In the Airports business, we reported 57% RE consumption and  in the ANIL business, the figure stood at 14%. Both these businesses, as  well as the Mining Service segment, also showed a decline in the emission,  energy and water consumption intensity during the year. This year we have achieved a reduction of 26% in emission intensity at  an AEL level, compared to last year. We have also managed over 99% of  waste generated through reuse, recycle and recovery and conducted  yearly safety assessment of 100% of our plants and offices. It will be our  continuous endeavour, going forward, to enhance our thrust on promoting  our ESG objectives, including our CSR initiatives, as we move forward  towards becoming a more responsible and sustainable organisation. On the operational front, we shall continue to strengthen our incubation  focus, and have earmarked 80% of our total capex of ~9 USD billion for  incubating businesses next year. We see these strategic investments  supporting our efforts to build assets for the future, while continuing to  augment the trust of our stakeholders, who did not lose confidence in our  credentials even in the midst of the worst ever crisis to hit the Company. Our efforts to become a global player and concurrently steer India  proactively towards the path of self-reliance and sustainability shall  get scaled up multifold in the years ahead. I would like to thank all the  stakeholders, including the employees, lenders, shareholders, government  and society at large, for contributing to our growth journey, and look  forward to their continued support and confidence in the organisation.

We conduct materiality assessments bi-annually and update the same to external stakeholders in case of any  material changes in the nature of businesses, or emergence of any new material topic. We comprehensively updated our Materiality Assessment in FY 2021-22, which was conducted through a  structured internal and external stakeholder consultation process, led by a third-party independent agency  and aligned with global and national best practices. As there were no material changes in the nature of AEL’s  business operations, the material topics remained unchanged for FY 2022-23 and FY 2023-24. The assessment followed the principles of double materiality, as below: Impact Materiality Impact of the company’s activities on the  economy, environment and people in the  short, medium and long term. Financial Materiality The impact of ESG issues (risks and opportunities)  on the company’s ability to generate value in the  short, medium and long term.

Enterprise Risk Management Framework Approach to Risk Management 1 2 3 4 5 Risk Identification  and Assessment Risk Mitigation  Strategies Risk Monitoring  and Reporting Compliance and Regulatory  Risk Management Business Continuity  Planning Our process begins with a thorough identification  and assessment of potential risks. This involves  a detailed analysis of both internal and external  factors that could impact our business. We  consider a wide range of risks, including  strategic, business, financial, environmental,  and reputational risks. Each identified risk is  then evaluated in terms of its likelihood and  potential impact, ensuring that our response is  proportionate and targeted.  Compliance with legal, regulatory, and ethical  standards is non-negotiable. We maintain a  comprehensive compliance framework to ensure  adherence. Regular reviews and audits are  conducted to identify compliance gaps, thereby  mitigating regulatory risks. Recognising the critical importance of maintaining business operations during  adverse events, we have robust business continuity plans in place. These plans  are designed to mitigate the impact of various disruptions, including natural  disasters and cyber-attacks, ensuring the resilience and continuity of our  critical business functions.

Globally, the sector's growth  rate is expected to substantially  increase onshore wind capacity  by approximately 90 GW annually  until 2030. In India, the target is to  achieve 140 GW of installed wind  capacity by 2030, up from 45 GW as  of December 31, 2023, translating to  a demand for 12 GW of wind turbine  generator (WTG) capacity per  year until 2030. The sectorial momentum reflects  the ongoing reforms in India and  the global emphasis on renewable  energy and carbon neutrality. Wind  energy is poised to play a crucial  role in achieving non-fossil power  generation targets for India and  other nations. Specific measures  such as renewable purchase  obligation (RPO) targets tailored for  wind energy, repowering policies for  old wind farms, and demand from  initiatives like the National Green  Hydrogen Mission are expected  to bolster domestic demand for  WTGs. Additionally, the scrapping  of reverse auctions for government  tenders, totalling 8 GW annually  until 2030, is anticipated to boost  wind capacity additions. Initiatives like round-the-clock  and peak power requirement  tenders will further support wind  projects, while upcoming tenders  for offshore wind projects are  poised to create new opportunities  for WTG manufacturers. These  reforms underscore the significant  role of wind energy in India's  and the world's transition  towards a more sustainable and  carbon-neutral future.

India's  aviation sector currently ranks as  the third-largest domestic market  globally, trailing only the United  States and China. The burgeoning  increase in per capita incomes  and spending propensity is driving  higher consumption and demand for  travel, leading to significant growth  in the aviation sector. Notably, the  Mumbai to Delhi route has become  the world’s third busiest route.  Indian carriers are embarking on  ambitious aircraft procurement  plans to cater to the escalating  domestic and international demand.  Air India's groundbreaking USD  70 billion deal for 470 Airbus and  Boeing planes, along with IndiGo's  blueprint to incorporate 500  aircraft and Akasa's aspiration to  expand its fleet by 150 aircraft,  stand out globally. To accommodate  such substantial fleet expansions,  vital infrastructure enhancements  are imperative. Major airports are  investing in additional runways  and expanding terminals, aiming to  quadruple capacities by 2030 to  facilitate over 100 flight movements  per hour. Additionally, advanced  air navigation technologies  facilitating all-weather CAT III  low visibility operations are being  progressively implemented. Despite the ongoing challenges  posed by the global pandemic,  the Indian aviation sector has  witnessed notable developments  in FY 2023-24, showcasing its  resilience and adaptability. Indian  airlines navigated complexities,  gradually recovering and adapting  to the evolving travel landscape.  They introduced new routes and  expanded services to enhance  connectivity within the country  and internationally.  Indian carriers are set to augment  their fleet by more than 150  aircraft in 2024, representing a 37%  increase from the previous year.  This includes IndiGo with 60, Air  India Express with 50, Air India with  20, Akasa Air with 16, Spicejet with  5, and Vistara with 3 aircraft. India's airport industry has  experienced substantial growth,  with the number of airports  increasing from 74 in 2014 to 148  in 2023, and the government aiming  to further increase this to 230 by  2030. This growth can be attributed  to the efforts to enhance regional  connectivity through initiatives  like UDAN-RCS, greenfield airport  development, and infrastructure  expansions at existing airports.  Airports in Navi Mumbai, Jewar,  and Bhogapuram are anticipated  to add significant capacities in  Maharashtra, Delhi, and Andhra  Pradesh, respectively. India is  expected to handle approximately  390 million passengers in  FY 2024-25 and 575 million  passengers annually by 2030. The growing number of airports is  complemented by a commitment  to sustainability. The Airports  Authority of India (AAI) has  outlined a roadmap to achieve  100% renewable energy usage  for all operational airports by  2025 and net-zero emissions by  2030. Currently, 55 airports utilise  100% green energy, with Mumbai  Airport leading the charge by  drawing 100% of its energy from  renewable sources. The aviation  sector is investing in fuel-efficient  aircraft and sustainable aviation  fuel, with some domestic airlines  conducting demonstration flights  using bio-fuel blended with aviation  turbine fuel.

The Economic Survey reports a  steady increase in the construction  of National Highways over time,  with 10,457 kilometres of roads  constructed in FY 2021-22 compared  to 6,061 kilometres in FY 2015-16.  Achieving the highest-ever  construction rate of 37 kilometers  per day of highways in FY 2020-21  showcases the sector's capacity for  rapid development.

Mr Krishna Prakash Maheshwari, CEO India Opportunity The infrastructure sector stands as  a pivotal driver in India's ambitious  goal to attain a USD 5 trillion  economy by 2028 and ultimately  transform into a ''Developed  Nation'' by 2047. With an estimated  expenditure of approximately  ` 143 lakh crore between fiscal  2024 and 2030, major investments  are earmarked for Roads &  Highways, Railways, and Water  infrastructure. To meet this demand  amid constraints on government  spending, the Public Private  Partnership (PPP) Model is gaining  prominence, with recent projections  indicating that general government  debt could surpass 100% of the  country's GDP by 2027-28. Budgetary allocations for the  road sector are expected to  increase substantially, with the  National Monetisation Pipeline  (NMP) and National Infrastructure  Pipeline (NIP) playing key roles  in mobilising infrastructure  investments. The National  Highways Authority of India (NHAI)  plans to monetise 46 projects  under the Toll-Operate-Transfer  (TOT) Model, further boosting  infrastructure development. This  momentum is underpinned by a  growing automobile sector, robust  government initiatives such as  ''Housing for All'' and ''Make in  India'', and significant foreign direct  investment (FDI) inflows in the  construction sector. Moreover, Indian reforms and  global trends underscore a  concerted effort to enhance  funding mechanisms, embrace  technological innovations, and  prioritise sustainability in the Roads  and Highways sector. The Ministry  of Road Transport and Highways  is spearheading initiatives like the  'Value Engineering Programme'  to promote the adoption of new  technologies and materials,  ensuring India's roads and highways  remain at the forefront of global  infrastructure development.

The big picture Just like how the edible oil industry looked two decades ago, there is huge potential in the  packaged staple foods market. Currently, about 90% of people buy their staples like grains and  flour in unbranded and loose forms. We foresee immense opportunities for growth by leveraging our  established brands and expansive distribution network. While the current edible oils market stands at around 23 million metric tonnes, commanding a 70%  penetration rate of packaged-branded players, the staple foods segment presents an even greater  opportunity. With less than 10% brand penetration, the potential for expansion is vast. We anticipate  rising demand for branded and hygienic food products, driven by projected economic growth, the  demographic dividend, improving education standards, and urbanisation trends.

This staged  expansion model positions Adani One as the premier  platform for both India and Bharat” Mr Sudipta Bhattacharya, CEO ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED Primary Industry Industry Overview India possesses a wide array of  minerals, encompassing fuels,  metallic, non-metallic, atomic, minor,  and rare minerals, enabling it to  excel on the global stage. The ability  to produce, process, utilise, and  recycle these natural resources will  be indispensable in the times ahead. Despite the evolving energy  landscape with a shift towards  renewables, coal accounts for 50%1  of its energy mix. India is inching  closer to reaching 1 billion tonne  of annual coal production while  targeting to achieve the 1.5 billion  tonne mark by FY302 with growing  energy demands. While coal demand  is projected to increase, efforts  towards coal gasification aim to  align with growing energy needs  and sustainability goals. National  Coal Gasification Mission, India  aims for 100 million tonnes of coal  gasification by 20303. India's mineral sector, including  metals and rare earth elements, is  poised for significant growth akin to  coal. Now the world's fifth-largest  economy with a GDP of ~USD 3.6  trillion, growing at 7.3%4, India relies  heavily on copper, aluminium, steel,  and rare earth minerals, which are  crucial for sectors like construction,  electrical and electronics, and  renewable energy. Over the past  two decades, India's refined copper  consumption has tripled, buoyed  by these expanding sectors. ANZ  Research predicts a promising  decade for Southeast Asia and India,  with a substantial share of global  copper demand growth5. India's  per capita consumption of refined  copper is less than the global  average of 3.2 kg, with enormous  opportunities for downstream  manufacturers. CRU, the global  market intelligence provider for  mines and metals, predicts India's  demand for refined copper to  reach 1,200 KT by 2028 from  819 KT in 20236. Similarly, India is the second-largest  producer of crude steel globally and  ranks fourth in iron ore production.  The global iron ore market is  projected to grow from 2.5 billion  metric tonnes in 2023 to 2.7 billion  metric tonnes by 2026, with a CAGR  of 3%.7 India's robust steel industry  drives its iron ore consumption,  which brings significant  opportunities for Mine Developers  and Operators (MDOs) in India. Additionally, India's aluminium  industry, fuelled by abundant  bauxite reserves, particularly in  states like Odisha, Chhattisgarh, and  Jharkhand, showcases remarkable  growth. Shifting focus towards  value-added products like extrusions  and rolled products has augmented  competitiveness and integration  with global supply chains. Embracing modernisation and  technology, these industries  have enhanced productivity and  efficiency while reducing energy  consumption and emissions.  Government initiatives such as  ''Make in India'' and ''Atmanirbhar  Bharat'' are further propelling the  aluminium, copper, rare mineral  and other metal industries'  growth by fostering domestic  manufacturing and innovation. As  India marches towards sustainable  practices and digitalisation, these  sectors anticipate a bright future  with increasing urbanisation  and industrialisation, offering  ample opportunities for growth  and investment. 1 https://coal.nic.in/en/major-statistics/coal-indian-energy-choice 2 https://coal.gov.in/sites/default/files/2021-01/coal-demand-projections20052022.pdf 3 https://coal.gov.in/sites/default/files/ncgm/ncgm21-09-21.pdf 4 FY 2023-24 estimate - https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1993550 5 As per ANZ Research Commodity Insight July 27, 2023  6 As per CRU copper-market-outlook-december-2023-data 7  Iron: usable ore production worldwide 2023 | Statista ; EY steel coal & iron ore report BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE REVIEW ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED 110 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 111 Strategic Review  ===== PAGE 60 ===== With presence across multiple  states (including Chhattisgarh,  Madhya Pradesh and Odisha), our  company stands as the largest  private sector MDO in India.

With  India ranking sixth globally in  chemical sales and its demand for  petrochemical products projected  to grow at a CAGR of 8% over  the next 15 years, the country's  petrochemical sector is valued  at around USD 180 billion (as  on 2023), ranking sixth globally.  Factors such as India's sustained  economic growth, supported by  strong macro fundamentals and  population growth, are expected  to fuel the country's ambitions in  petrochemical manufacturing. The optimism in the sector stems  from India's significantly lower per  capita consumption compared to  developed nations, indicating ample  headroom for demand expansion  and corresponding investment.  India is poised to contribute  10% of the incremental global  petrochemical demand growth  and is set to experience robust  growth from its current 4% share of  global capacity. According to the  International Energy Agency (IEA),  India is projected to drive more than  a third of the growth in oil demand  by 2030 and nearly half by 2050,  surpassing sectors like trucks,  aviation, and shipping. Policy reforms enacted by the  government further bolster  this opportunity: 	 The government has allowed  100% foreign direct investment  (FDI) in the petrochemicals  sector through the automatic  investment route 	 Implementation of a scheme  to support the establishment  of need-based plastic parks  with advanced infrastructure,  facilitating common facilities  through a cluster development  approach. The government offers  grant funding of up to 50%  of the project cost, capped at  ` 40 crore per project 	 The government's initiative to  establish a Centre of Excellence  is anticipated to modernise the  petrochemical industry 	 Incentives for innovation and  inventions in the petrochemical  and downstream plastic  processing industry segments are  also on the government's agenda India’s competitiveness Feedstock Access: India's petrochemical industry relies heavily on imports, with over 65%  of refining capacity tied to oil imports. Nearly 80% of the country's  petrochemical production capacity is integrated with petroleum  refineries, providing a strategic advantage in terms of access  to raw materials. Market Access: India exhibits a relatively low per capita consumption of chemicals  compared to global averages. However, factors such as a large  population, rising per capita income, and increasing demand across  various end-use industries have positioned India as an appealing market  for petrochemical products. Capital Cost: India offers competitive manufacturing and production costs compared  to other nations owing to economies of scale, low labour expenses, and  advantageous logistics locations. Operating Cost: The availability of skilled labour at competitive rates has been  instrumental in managing the operating costs within India's  petrochemical industry. Global PVC market is growing at ~4% while Indian PVC  market has substantial import substitution potential having  domestic demand in excess of ~4 million MTPA whereas  capacity is only about 1.5 million MTPA. Currently, MPL is  developing 1 million MTPA PVC plant under phase-1 which  is expected to be commissioned by Dec’26. All the long lead  items have been ordered & we are progressing in line with  the expected timelines. We intend to explore more such  opportunities aiming to develop an integrated petrochemical  cluster and reduce India’s import dependency in line with  Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign.” Mr Jayant Parimal, CEO BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE REVIEW Segment Overview Introduction The Company is in the  developmental phase of establishing  a petrochemical cluster in Mundra,  Gujarat. Within this cluster, the  Company aims to implement a PVC  project with a capacity of 2 million  metric tonnes (MMT) per annum, to  be executed in phases. The initial  phase, with a capacity of 1 MMT per  annum, is slated for commissioning  by December 2026. India's annual PVC demand stands  at approximately 4 MMT, while  domestic production capacity  is only 1.5 MMT, resulting in a  supply-demand gap and substantial  imports ranging from 2.5 MMT.  Despite the Company's forthcoming  PVC capacity, the anticipated  shortfall will escalate to around 4  MMT by 2030. Key sectors such  as agriculture, construction, and  infrastructure are the primary  drivers of PVC demand in India. The  proposed project aims to cater to  the underserved domestic market  and mitigate import dependency.

BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE REVIEW Current Geopolitical Situation India is the world's fifth-largest  economy and is projected to  become the third-largest economy  by 2030. India’s journey towards  self-reliance is not merely an  economic pursuit; it's a pledge  to protect India’s sovereignty  with our strength. Historically, over the past 70 years,  India has heavily relied on global  OEMs from US, France, Israel,  Russia, etc. for the procurement  of defence equipment and  technologies. This dependence  has fostered a concerning circle of  increased reliance on imports and  slow growth of local capabilities,  hindering our nation-building  endeavours. Additionally, it has  exposed India to the inherent risk  of sustenance of platforms and  supply chains especially in a volatile  geopolitical environment. The strategic shift initiated  by the Indian government to  prioritise national security in  2014, embarked on the largest  modernisation initiative for the  armed forces and emphasised  self-sufficiency in defence  manufacturing. This paradigm  shift towards indigenisation  reflects India’s commitment to  ‘Atmanirbhar  Bharat’, aiming to  reduce dependency on imports,  advance technological capabilities,  and innovate in the defence and  aerospace sector. Moreover, a pivotal decision by  the Indian government to cease  importing capital equipment,  subsequently reviewing numerous  import acquisition cases pursued  by the armed forces, underscores  India's resolve to bolster its  indigenous defence capabilities and  diminish reliance on imports. In 2023, geopolitical challenges  have escalated, whether in Eastern  Europe or in Middle East, leading  to heightened global tensions  that reverberated across multiple  spheres of life. These developments  underscored the imperative of  addressing critical gaps and  necessities in the development  and manufacturing of defence  equipment, technology, and  platforms within India. Furthermore,  it highlighted the pressing need for  fostering a self-sustained, reliable,  and indigenised ecosystem that  extends beyond conventional  warfare paradigms. Adani Defence & Aerospace Nation-building has always been  at the heart of Adani Defence &  Aerospace. We stand at the brink of  exponential growth for the country. Under the visionary leadership of  Adani Group’s Chairman, Mr Gautam  Adani, who wants to leave a legacy  by making a humble contribution to  the Indian Armed Forces and to see  a nation rising above dependence,  a Bharat claiming its rightful  place in the forefront of quality,  innovation, and technology in the  global landscape. In our contribution to this climb,  we are committed to bolstering  India's defence and security  capabilities in alignment with the  Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative and  strive to elevate India's defence  capabilities to global standards,  holding together the pillars of  innovation, sustainability, and social  responsibility. Through strategic collaborations  with credible global partners, we  have succeeded in establishing a  resilient network of capabilities.  To foster indigenous expertise and  strengthen the domestic defence  industry, we continue to make  strategic investments in unique  products and technologies working  with Indian small and medium-sized  businesses. Our efforts revolve  around positioning India as a key  player in the global market and  substantially reducing the country's  net current account deficit through  robust exports. At the core of our philosophy is  embracing a culture of innovation  and agility in meeting all defence  requirements domestically, by  delivering cutting-edge solutions  to prioritise technologies  and platforms of strategic  importance for India.

India Opportunity The Indian Media and  Entertainment (M&E) sector  continued its upward trend, growing  at 8.1% to reach ` 2.32 trillion in  2023. Despite being 21% higher  than its pre-pandemic levels,  television, print, and radio remained  below their 2019 levels. Although  television maintained its status as  the largest segment, digital media  is expected to surpass it in 2024.  The M&E sector is projected to  grow at 10.2%, reaching ` 2.55  trillion by 2024, and further  maintain a CAGR of 10%, reaching  ` 3.08 trillion by 2026. Except for television, all segments  within the M&E industry  experienced growth in 2023. The  increase of ` 173 billion marked a  slowdown compared to the growth  of ` 371 billion observed in 2022,  primarily attributable to challenges  in advertising during the first half  of the year. New media platforms  such as digital and online gaming  saw the most substantial growth,  accounting for ` 122 billion of  the total growth. Consequently,  their contribution to the M&E  sector increased from 20% in  2019 to 38% in 2023. Meanwhile,  the share of traditional media  (including television, print, filmed  entertainment, live events, out-of- home advertising, music, and radio)  decreased to 57% of M&E sector  revenues in 2023, down from 76%  in 2019. Experiential segments,  encompassing activities outside  the home and interactive platforms  sustained robust growth throughout  2023. Consequently, online  gaming, filmed entertainment,  live events, and out-of-home  media segments collectively  grew by 18%, contributing 48% to  the total growth. The Indian M&E sector will grow  at a CAGR of 10% and add ` 763  billion in three years. New media  will contribute 61% of this growth,  followed by animation and VFX (9%)  and television (9%). Considering  that video, audio, text and  experiences are accessible across  almost all segments, the M&E sector  is redefining itself across these four  verticals: Video – TV, video OTT,  short video, social; Experiential –  Online gaming, cinemas, events,  OOH; Textual – print, online news;  and Audio – radio, music, audio OTT. Video remained the highest-earning  segment in 2023, given its simplicity  and ease of consumption. Although  experiential revenues were affected  by the pandemic in 2020 and 2021,  they have since recovered, with  their share expected to continue  expanding in tandem with the  growth of India’s per capita income.  While the decline in print circulation  may have led to a permanent  loss for text mediums, they are  projected to maintain relative  stability in terms of advertising  and subscription growth, albeit at  a slower pace compared to other  media. Furthermore, revenue models  for audio platforms remain largely  supported by digital advertising.

Our commitment to resilience goes  beyond our immediate operations  to include the broader ecosystem  of stakeholders. By engaging with  local communities and stakeholders,  we encourage collaborative efforts  towards resilience, contributing to  the sustainability and well-being of  the regions in which we operate. Transition Risks Key transition risks have been  identified for ensuring sustainable  growth and maintaining a  competitive advantage. Market  Risks, driven by fluctuating prices  of input materials, pose challenges  to cost structure and profitability.   Technology is a key lever for  enabling the successful execution of  projects. Limited access to critical  technology may affect project  schedules, costs, and deliverables.  Hence, technological risks also  have an impact. Evolving regulatory  landscapes demand proactive  adaptation to meet increasing  emissions reporting obligations,  which can result in associated  costs and potential impacts on  profitability. Reputational Risks arise  from the failure to achieve publicly  stated climate-related targets,  potentially harming reputation and  impacting stakeholders’ trust. Strengthening Climate Adaptation  and Resilience In line with our commitment to sustainability and proactive risk management, we undertook  a rigorous scenario analysis to evaluate the physical risks posed by climate change across  our diverse business units. The analysis was focused on chronic heat, flooding, exceptional  drought, and precipitation. It leveraged the advanced capabilities of the OS-Climate PhysRisk  tool, developed by the Linux Foundation (https://os-climate.org/). Our assessment spanned  five key Adani Enterprises’ business units: Airports, Mining Services, Roads and Water, Data  Centers, and Solar Manufacturing. Our analysis incorporated two critical Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs): RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. Emissions Scenarios Considered RCP 4.5 is described by the Intergovernmental  Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as a  moderate scenario in which emissions peak  around 2040 and then decline. This scenario  is consistent with limiting global warming to  2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. RCP 8.5 assumes that emissions continue to  rise throughout the 21st century. RCP 8.5 is  generally taken as the basis for worst-case  climate change scenarios and is consistent  with global warming of 4 degrees Celsius or  more above preindustrial levels.

This policy  provides a structured framework for  identifying, evaluating and managing  biodiversity-related impacts and risks  at our project sites. Our biodiversity policy is available  on our website and can be  accessed from here. https:// www.adanienterprises.com/-/media/ Project/Enterprises/Investors/ corporate-governance/Polices/ Biodiversity-Policy.pdf Aim and Objectives At AEL, we aim to achieve “No Net  Loss to Biodiversity” in alignment  with the national benchmark  and international  benchmark for  biodiversity i.e., Indian Business  & Biodiversity Initiative (IBBI) and  TNFD framework. The overarching  aim of our biodiversity-related  efforts is to minimise our ecological  footprint, thereby contributing to  the conservation and sustainable  management of biodiversity. Through  our focused efforts, we strive to  mitigate operational impacts on  threatened species and their natural  habitats and natural ecosystems. Committed to Biodiversity  Conservation We are dedicated to ensuring no  net loss to biodiversity. Aligning our  approach with the TNFD framework  endorsed by the Taskforce on  Nature-related Financial Disclosures  (TNFD) and the framework of India  Business and Biodiversity Initiative  (IBBI) constitutes the cornerstone  of our efforts to safeguard  biodiversity, ensuring sustainable  practices and ecological balance. Compensatory  Afforestation Land (Ha) PEKB, Surguja (CG) 3,797.00 GP-III, Raigarh (CG) 395.45 Talabira, Jharsuguda  (Odisha) 2,089.08 Suliyari, Singrauli (MP) 259.24 Kurmitar Iron Ore,  Sundergarh (Odisha) 651.00 Biodiversity Risk Assessment At Adani Enterprises, we recognise  the paramount importance of  biodiversity risk assessment in  upholding our commitment to  environmental stewardship and  sustainable business practices.  As part of our commitment to  biodiversity conservation, we  integrate Biodiversity Impact  Assessment into the Environment  Impact Assessment (EIA) process  for both greenfield and brownfield  projects requiring clearance from  the Ministry of Environment, Forest  and Climate Change (MoEFCC)  or State Environment Impact  Assessment Authority (SEIAA).  Prior to project commencement, we  conduct comprehensive baseline  studies on flora and fauna, focusing  on endangered and nationally  protected species within the  project’s influence area, as outlined  in the EIA Terms of Reference as  well as internationally and nationally  recognised methodologies. We  assess any potential impacts or  risks to biodiversity resulting from  project activities. As part of the assessment studies,  public consultation is also an  important exercise by which the  concerns of local persons and  others who have plausible stake in  the environmental impacts of the  project or activity are ascertained  with a view to taking into account  all the material concerns in the  project or activity design as  appropriate, including biodiversity. To ensure the integrity and  impartiality of our assessments,  we actively engage third-party  independent agencies accredited  by Ministry of Environment and  Forests. This approach guarantees  that our evaluations are conducted  with transparency and objectivity.  Moreover, we prioritise stakeholder  involvement, actively seeking inputs  from diverse groups to address all  concerns comprehensively. By gathering comprehensive data  on threatened species, protected  areas and ecosystem services,  we develop bespoke biodiversity  management plans. These plans  are tailored to mitigate risks and  advance conservation efforts  across all our operations. Based  on the biodiversity related risk  and impact identified as part of  EIA, a biannual status update  report is provided to Ministry of  Environment Forest and Climate  Change (MoEFCC) illustrating  the progress made against the  biodiversity management plan  developed for the project. Our  proactive stance underscores  our unwavering dedication to  minimising environmental impact  and safeguarding biodiversity  for the well-being of present and  future generations. Biodiversity Action Plan  of PEKB mine Biodiversity Management  Plans (BMPs) Our biodiversity management plans  are pivotal to our dedication to  environmental conservation and  sustainable business practices.  Through meticulous documentation  and analysis of local biodiversity,  encompassing both flora and fauna,  we formulate strategies to mitigate  and reverse adverse impacts  on the environment near our  operations. Our approach allows us to  address controllable risks such  as habitat loss, fragmentation  and disturbance, as well as the  introduction of invasive species.  We implement compensatory  afforestation and habitat  restoration initiatives, not only  to mitigate project impacts but  also to contribute to broader  biodiversity conservation goals  in the region. For example, within  our Mining Services business,  we undertake compensatory  afforestation to combat soil  erosion. We work closely with State  Forest Departments to develop  plantation plans and monitor  progress. Initiatives like Sal  (Shorea robusta) tree plantation  and tree transplantation are  employed to protect and restore  habitats, fostering a mutually  beneficial relationship between  our business activities and the  surrounding ecosystems. Wildlife Hazard  Management Plan Wildlife conservation and  hazard management are integral  components of our commitment  to environmental stewardship.  As part of this commitment, we  conduct rigorous assessments and  implement proactive measures to  mitigate risks posed by wildlife  to our operations and vice versa.  Through collaboration with external  experts and adherence to regulatory  guidelines, we ensure the safety  of our operational facilities while  preserving biodiversity. Step 1: Assessment and  Identification: We conduct a  thorough assessment of wildlife  hazards on and around our premises  in collaboration with external  experts, such as forest departments  and agricultural universities. This  assessment includes identifying  wildlife habitats, sources of food,  behaviour patterns, mood, and  reproductive cycles to understand  potential risks. Step 2: Risk Mitigation and  Control Measures: Based on the  assessment, we establish measures  and procedures to minimise the  risk of collisions between wildlife  and aircraft within the vicinity  of its operations. This involves  implementing flexible deterrent,  dispersal and control measures to  prevent habituation and mitigate  potential hazards effectively. Step 3: Monitoring and Reporting:  We maintain comprehensive records  of strike reports, including species,  observations and intelligence  gathered, facilitating ongoing  monitoring and analysis. Reporting  protocols are established to  ensure that wildlife control issues  are promptly communicated to  aerodrome management for timely  action and resolution. Our Airports business have  adopted a 3-step approach  to assess and reduce the risk  posed by wildlife to aircraft: Hazard Identification – Broad  assessment of the airport’s  hazard profile, including aircraft  movements, the habitat and  activities that attract wildlife both  on and off the airport, the species  most observed on and off the  airport, and the trends observed in  wildlife strikes. Risk Assessment – Based on the  information available on wildlife  numbers, behaviour, characteristics  and/or strikes for each species  encountered on and around the  airport. Wildlife Hazard Management Plan –  Comprising actions for each of the  highest risk species, supported  by prevention measures that can  help the airport to reduce the  degree of risk and meet its wildlife  management goals and objectives.

Hazard Identification A. Aircraft Movements and Types The frequency and type of aircraft  movements at an aerodrome  significantly influences the  likelihood of bird and wildlife  strikes. Large turbofan aircraft,  which operate at higher speeds  and have larger frontal surface  areas, are more susceptible to  wildlife strikes due to their greater  engine suction power compared to  propeller-driven aircraft. B. Habitats 	 Flora: The Ahmedabad  region is characterised by  its diverse flora, thanks to  its moderate to high rainfall  and abundant sunshine.  Common species include  Neem, Eucalyptus and Cassia. 	 Fauna: The area is home to  various birds such as peacocks,  parakeets, lapwings and kites,  as well as animals like street  dogs, Hanuman langurs,  hares and cats. C. Activities Attracting Wildlife 	 Annual Wet Season: From  June to September, the airport  experiences its highest rainfall,  leading to rapid grass growth,  and attracting numerous birds  and wildlife to the runway area. 	 Grass Cutting Activities:  Mowing grass around the  runway exposes subterranean  insects, attracting predatory  and migratory birds. 	 Runway Lights: These lights  attract insects, which in turn  attract birds and wildlife to  the runway edges. 	 Nearby Meat Shops: Several  meat shops and fish markets  within 10 km of the airport can  attract wildlife. D. Wildlife Activities Observed 	 Inside the Operational Area:  Sightings include occasional  snakes, rats, dogs and langurs;  rare sightings of wild cats and  hares and frequent sightings of  birds like lapwings, house crows,  pigeons and peacocks. 	 Outside the Airport Premises:  Regular sightings of dogs and  snakes; frequent sightings of  Hanuman langurs/monkeys;  occasional sightings of hares. E. Wildlife/Bird Strike History Wildlife strike records from  the past five years have been  crucial in assessing species  struck, identifying trends, and  implementing preventive measures  to ensure safety and reduce costs  associated with aircraft damage. 2. Risk Assessment Historical strike data has been used  to classify each wildlife species  into high, moderate, or low risk  categories. The probability of strikes  has significantly decreased following  infrastructure improvements and  proactive management. 3. Wildlife Hazard  Management Plan 3.1 Passive Management 	 Waste Disposal System:  Improved waste management  practices, including regular  garbage collection and disposal,  have been implemented to  minimise wildlife attraction. 	 Grass Cutting: Regular mowing  keeps grass height below 15 cm,  reducing conditions of wildlife  habitat creation. 	 Airport Perimeter Wall: A  complete perimeter wall with  solar fencing has been installed  to deter wildlife from entering  the airport area. 	 Eviction of Slaughterhouses:  Enforcement of regulations to  prohibit animal slaughter within  10 km of the airport. 3.2 Active Management 	 Runway Inspections: Regular  inspections are conducted to  ensure runway usability, and to  detect wildlife presence, with  appropriate dispersal techniques  employed as needed. 	 Harassment Techniques:  Various methods, including the  use of firecrackers, acoustic  devices and reflective films, are  employed to minimise bird and  wildlife presence effectively. Checking & Review Routine and non-routine monitoring  activities are essential components  of the wildlife management  programme, ensuring early  detection of hazards, and enabling  timely responses to shift in wildlife  behaviour or populations. This comprehensive approach,  combining risk assessment, habitat  management, and both passive  and active management strategies,  has been effective in mitigating  wildlife hazards at Ahmedabad  airport, enhancing safety for  aircraft operations.

Our approach ensures  fair and competitive remuneration, aligning with our  commitment to excellence and equity. Human Capital Development Strategy Our Human Capital Development strategy is designed  to create digitally skilled, future-ready employees  and exceptional, home-grown leaders, through  institutionalised, immersive, rigorous, hands-on learning  interventions and scalable development frameworks.  Our programs and processes are designed to offer  accelerated growth to our employees, as we look at  creating a younger, more dynamic and agile workforce  to drive our growth. The idea is to enable experiential  learning and better understanding of business to create  leaders early. With “Digital Dexterity” and “Leadership  Development” being the top strategic organizational  priorities, the L&OD strategy is methodical, and focuses  on educating and equipping our workforce with  new-age and futuristic skills along with strong emphasis  on tacit knowledge, and Adani DNA for culture-building.  Through comprehensive learning journeys, comprising  classroom, on-ground, social, and digital learning,  the L&OD initiatives have been directed to facilitate  business by inculcating relevant skills, and the right  mindset to contribute to business growth and achieve  one’s full potential. Continuous Learning and Professional Growth The L&OD approach is centred at building a continuous  learning culture so that employees are equipped  and enabled to adapt to the sheer volume and depth  of continuous change.  Hence, the curriculum and  content for most programs are curated in collaboration  with globally renowned educational institutions  and professional entities, to conduct class-leading  training and certification programs. Periodic revisions  in curriculum and content form an integral part of  the L&OD operating model. With varying degrees of  intensity catering to different management levels,  the curriculum offers a broad spectrum of subjects,  including Strategy, Finance, Design Thinking,  Innovation, behavioural training, soft skill enhancement,  Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices  to name a few. In addition to academic sessions,  there are On-Ground business immersions, and action  learning projects aimed at solutioning for real-business  challenges. Thought leaders from diverse areas like  Geo-Politics, Economics, Leadership, Government  functioning, Public Policy and more conduct  comprehensive sessions with the participants. Our  L&OD initiatives are designed on 70:20:10 principle of  adult learning wherein 70% learning is experiential, 20%  through specific projects where participants collaborate  with others and 10% around functional and soft skills is  imparted through classroom/formal training.   E-Learning Initiatives Our digital learning platform, e-Vidyalaya Percipio,  developed in partnership with Skillsoft, facilitates  flexible access to comprehensive learning. Through this  initiative, all employees, including the ones situated  at remote sites can access digital learning resources,  and learn at their own pace and convenience. The  knowledge resources on the e-Vidyalaya Percipio  platform are also utilized to design hybrid L&OD  interventions, thereby, providing diverse learning  opportunities to employees.  Digital Dexterity A Group-wide effort towards cultivating a digital  thinking mindset has been introduced through  “Digital Dexterity” initiative. Starting from educating  every employee on the new age digital technologies,  to developing digital and analytical acumen, the  e-learning program offers comprehensive modules  covering six key areas: customer- centric innovation,  operational excellence, data-driven decision-making,  ecosystem engagement, cyber-security data-privacy,  and talent development. The curriculum equips and  enables employees to understand critical concepts and  technologies to thrive in a digital-first world. Mentorship and Coaching Mentorship and coaching are pivotal elements of  people development and culture-building. While our  senior leaders are coached by professional coaches,  our ‘teaching leaders’ philosophy reinforces the senior  leaders and promoters to dedicatedly mentor, coach,  and guide their team members. Being deeply aware  of the organisational networks, business priorities,  and individual motivators for their teams, these senior  leaders leverage their coaching skills and organisational  insight while mentoring their team members.  Mentoring sessions are designed around developing  a better understanding of human relationships,  self-awareness, natural strengths and development  areas. This top-down approach facilitates accelerated  career progression, leadership development, and  reinforces employee dedication and affinity towards  the organisation.

The PMS strategy is  focused on building a high-performance culture and  meritocracy allowing greater differentiation and more  effective distribution of the Rewards budget in line  with individual performance, and impact created.  It  encompasses Career Progression dialogues with more  frequency and rigour to share feedback, expectations,  career aspirations and clearly define the goals and  priorities for the future, Career Mobility and Advancement  opportunities across different businesses, and  Development Plans to identify the need for up-skilling or  re-skilling in line with the business priorities.  The PMS process spans a comprehensive range of  activities, including goal setting, mid-year check-ins,  assessments, annual reviews, recommendations for  ratings and promotions, moderation, and individual  feedback sessions. A clear distinction between high  achievers and those needing improvement is pivotal  for recognising top performers, pinpointing areas for  enhancement, and guiding our decisions on promotions,  recognition & rewards, and professional development.  It ensures a fair and equitable assessment process,  enabling the accurate identification of standout  employees as well as those who may require additional  support or training. All eligible employees are subject to an annual  performance review in line with the company's  guidelines. For those in non-permanent roles,  performance evaluations are carried out by their  respective contractors, adhering to their organisational  guidelines or any stipulations that may be set forth in  our contractual agreements.  This comprehensive approach ensures that every  member of our organisation receives a fair and  thorough appraisal of their contributions over the past  year, supporting our commitment to excellence and  continuous improvement. Return on Human Capital Investment The Return on Human Capital Investment (HCI) metric  is a critical tool for assessing our company's profitability  with respect to the total costs associated with our  employees. This measure is calculated by excluding  non-employee related expenses from the total operating  costs, thereby isolating the operating profit generated  directly from our workforce. It offers a precise insight  into how effectively economic value is generated from  investments in human capital. By prioritising the analysis of our HCI return, we are  equipped to make strategic decisions about how we  allocate resources, approach talent acquisition, and  implement talent development programmes. This  focus is key to building a workforce that is not only  highly efficient and engaged but also instrumental in  propelling our business objectives forward. Our ongoing commitment to optimising the return on  human capital investment is geared towards cultivating  an organisational culture that is appealing to the  industry's finest talents.

These assessments identify areas  for improvement and enable us to take corrective  actions effectively.

Promotion of Natural Farming The Adani Foundation is committed  to promote natural methods of  farming that not only enhance the  soil health but also boost the income  levels of farmers. It believes in this  chemical-free farming system rooted  in Indian tradition and enriched with  modern understanding of ecology,  resource recycling, and on-farm  resource optimisation. The Foundation is supporting  nano fertilisers – nutrients that  are encapsulated or coated  within nanomaterial in order to  enable controlled release, and its  subsequent slow diffusion into  the soil. It is aimed at integrating  innovative technology through  natural farming. The nano formulation the potential  to reduce input costs to the farmers  and raising crop-productivity in  organic ways. These fertilisers  massively improve plant physiology  during different stages of growth.  Upon dilution in water, the soil is  enriched with natural available  carbon and nutrients biomass. This  enhanced soil then boosts microbial  activities which are beneficial in  fighting root diseases. The use  of this nano formulation would  substantially reduce the cost of  agriculture on usage of fertilisers  while enhancing the quality of  soil make it more productive with  reduction in usages of other  pesticides and water too. The Adani Foundation has  supported Gau Life Sciences (GLS)  with the purpose of integrating  innovative technology to address  the challenge of slurry management  in the biogas plant of GVF. Through  close collaboration with GVF, GLS  aims to explore and implement  environment friendly methods  for slurry disposal and utilisation.  The Foundation is committed to  providing financial assistance to  GLS for establishing and operating  facilities dedicated to managing  slurry efficiently. This support aims  to convert slurry into valuable  products such as advanced organic  nano fertilisers, fostering positive  social impact and regenerative  farming practices to enhance  soil quality and thereby positively  impacting harvests. As per recent updates, GLS has  duly integrated the process and  have produced two products:  “Gautilizer-Gold” and “Gau-Grow”  (along with other variants under  development) with nutrients derived  from the biogas plant slurry at  GVF’s Varanasi plant. Both products  have an enormous potential to  enhance agriculture in multiple  ways, including in the production of  quality fodder and other agriculture  produces. These Advanced Organic  Fertilisers (AOF) promise great  benefit to the farmers and fodder  growers for the advancement of  agricultural processes. “Gautilizer-Gold” and “Gau-Grow”  are produced with advanced  nano formulation technology to  provide highly effective nutrition  management in the agri-crop  cycle having potential to reduce  input costs for farmers and raising  crop-productivity in organic ways.  Both these products are in liquid  form with organic composition  of nano formulation which, when  applied massively, improves plant  physiology during different stages  of growth. Upon dilution in water,  the soil is enriched with natural  available carbon and nutrients  biomass. This enhances soil and  boosts microbial activities which are  beneficial in fighting root diseases.  The use of this nano formulation  would substantially reduce the cost  of agriculture comparing to usage  of fertilisers.

Health & Nutrition Ensuring Responsible Sourcing AEL believes and practices “Doing What is Right” as its core mantra, treating our  suppliers in a fair manner, bringing digital and transparent systems to onboard  and transact through their lifecycle with us intrinsic to our day-to-day operations  across all business units. The organisational culture at Adani Enterprises regards  suppliers as essential pillars of our business, extending our core operations.  They serve as enablers of our ongoing efforts to create and deliver value to our  stakeholders and the nation as a whole. Consequently, prioritising our supplier  network has led us to view this relationship as an opportunity rather than a mere  obligation. This further help us aiming at integrating sustainability principles into  our operations, thereby enhancing our brand reputation, and fostering efficient,  result-driven practices. ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED 224 225 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 Strategic Review Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements  ===== PAGE 117 ===== Approach to Sustainability Integration and  Supplier Screening Our commitment extends beyond profitability, as we  strive to develop agile, resilient, and sustainable supply  chain management (SMC) that align with Environmental,  Social, and Governance (ESG) principles. Central to our  SCM strategy is the integration of ESG considerations  into every facet of our operations, fostering transparency  and ethical practices throughout the supply chain.  Leveraging platforms like the ARIBA portal, we screen  suppliers based on ESG criteria and other relevant  parameters during the onboarding process. After ARIBA screening, suppliers undergo further  screening upon onboarding, where ESG indicators are  integrated into purchase order terms. Subsequent  screenings occur during regular meetings and training  sessions, aiming to educate suppliers on best practices  and industry developments. ESG Integration in Supply Chain  Management Strategy Our journey into ESG integration within supply chain  management commenced with a comprehensive  exploration of sustainability concepts, leading us  to establish a benchmark for responsible sourcing.  Purchasing practices towards suppliers are continuously  reviewed to ensure alignment with the Supplier Code  of Conduct and to avoid potential conflicts with ESG  requirements. We have also delineated sustainability  criteria for Tier 1 suppliers, motivating them to  initiate sustainability measures while augmenting  local sourcing to bolster economic development.  This focus culminated in the implementation of a  sustainability-based vendor ranking system for all  procurement decisions, ensuring compliance with  environmental, social, and governance standards.  Prioritising responsible practices enables us to attract  socially conscious investors, thereby catalysing the  transformation of global supply chains. Our commitment  serves as a beacon, inspiring others to embrace similar  sustainable initiatives and fostering collaboration  towards a more sustainable future. Oversight of Supplier ESG Programme A board level ESG committee composed of 100%  independent directors (CRC), has oversight of  implementation of various ESG aspects into AEL's  strategy, including the Supplier ESG Programmme.  Each business unit has a dedicated techno-commercial  team responsible for procurement, contracts, and  vendor management. These teams receive guidance  from the Adani Enterprises team to ensure alignment  with the Group’s sustainable supply chain philosophy  and strict adherence to the supplier code of conduct.  This translates to top-level executives overseeing and  ensuring the successful execution of the supplier ESG  programme throughout the organisation. Supplier Code of Conduct Our Supplier Code of Conduct establishes a framework  for ethical business practices and sustainability across  our supply chain, fostering strong partnerships with  suppliers and upholding global standards of corporate  responsibility and integrity. Our supplier code of  conduct is a comprehensive set of guiding principles  that reflects our commitment to internationally  recognised standards, including the United Nations  Global Compact (UNGC) and core conventions of the  International Labour Organisation (ILO). It outlines  expectations for professional and ethical behaviour  from all suppliers and emphasises collaboration in  promoting lawful and fair business practices.

This can lead to legal  fines and penalties,  financial forfeiture,  damage to brand  reputation, loss of  business opportunities  and valuation. This can lead to  prosecution by  regulators, insurance  claims due to  accidents and injuries,  reduce employee  motivation in turn  leading to loss of  productivity and  hamper the brand  image and reputation.

Our commitment to personal and collective integrity,  gender respect, maintaining a zero-tolerance policy  for sexual harassment, ethical transgressions,  ensuring fair recruitment, unbiased performance  evaluations and abiding by the laws of   the countries. To effectively manage contractual labour, we have  implemented a robust Contract Labour Management  System. Through a thorough registration process,  we ensure that every member of our contractual  workforce is of legal age for employment, as defined  by the applicable legal authority. We strictly adhere to  all relevant laws governing human rights and labour  practices and ensure compliance with them in every  aspect of our operations.

Customised risk mitigation plans are created to address specific risks identified during screening, outlining  actionable steps and controls. Through engagement, monitoring, capacity building, and self-assessments, we aim to  build a resilient and responsible supply chain aligned with sustainability goals. Our supplier risk mitigation approach employs a four-dimensional method aimed at maximising efficiency and  effectiveness of our operations.

Address  identified risks, share best practices, and  encourage continuous improvement. Improvement Plan Following screening and assessment, we identify areas  for improvement and actively engage with the suppliers.  Through awareness sessions and induction programmes  conducted by respective departments we articulate  our vision on safety, sustainability, human rights,  and industrial relations requirements. Additionally,  regardless of assessment results, we encourage  suppliers to develop improvement plans and optimise  potential areas. Grievance Redressal for Suppliers We provide a transparent and unambiguous grievance  management system for suppliers. Suppliers can  interact one-on-one with company  representatives  or directly approach supervisors to address their  complaints. We ensure timely responses and assign  responsibility within the concerned team to address  grievances within a defined timeline. Proportion of Spending on MSME and Local  Suppliers We champion micro, small, and medium enterprises  (MSMEs) to foster overall economic development.  Emphasising local economic growth, we increase our  local sourcing and procurement spend to support  community enterprises.

Demonstrating remarkable resilience,  it undergoes a steady but gradual recovery, albeit with  regional disparities. According to the International  Monetary Fund (IMF), global growth maintained a modest  rate of 3.2% in CY 2023. Multiple factors, including  ongoing geopolitical conflicts, inflation, a sluggish  recovery in China, volatility in energy and food markets,  and elevated interest rates, have led to a slowdown in  global economic growth. Furthermore, the crisis in the  Red Sea route has caused the biggest diversion of global  trade in decades, resulting in higher logistical costs,  shipment delays, elevated fuel and commodity prices,  and industry-wide disruptions. Despite these challenges, signs of stable growth, strong  economic performance in the United States and several  major emerging market and developing economies,  coupled with inflation reaching target levels in advanced  economies, indicate a reduced likelihood of a severe  economic downturn. Furthermore, other positive factors  include the diminishing impact of previous energy price  shocks and a significant resurgence in labour supply in  many advanced economies. Global inflation, a key concern over the past three  years, continues to recede at a faster pace from 8.7% in  CY 2022 to 6.8% in CY 2023. Despite headline inflation  experiencing a decline from its unprecedented peaks,  core inflation has remained persistent and is expected  to decline gradually. The price of Brent crude oil averaged USD 83 per barrel  in CY 2023, down from USD 101 per barrel in CY 2022.  However, the spot price of Brent crude oil averaged  USD  90 per barrel in April 2024 due to escalating  tensions in the Middle East, attacks on Russian refineries  and anticipated voluntary production cuts by OPEC+  until the end of June 2024.  Despite the major economic shocks, global trade has been  resilient in recent years. Merchandise trade experienced  a decline of 1.2% in CY 2023 as import demand in real  terms fell sharply in Europe, declined in North America  and remained flat in Asia. However, imports surged in  the Middle East and the Commonwealth of Independent  States (CIS) region. Region-wise growth (%) Region  CY  2023 CY  2024 (P) CY  2025 (P) Global Economy 3.2 3.2 3.2 Advanced Economies  (AEs) 1.6 1.7 1.8 Emerging Markets and  Developing Economies  (EMDEs)  4.3 4.2 4.2 (P - Projections) (Source: International Monetary Fund) Performance of major economies United States: The GDP of the US increased from   1.9% in CY 2022 to 2.5% in CY 2023. The US economy  has witnessed the strongest recovery among major  economies, marked by a stronger performance in private  consumption, swift containment of a looming banking  crisis, a tight labour market, and rising wages. China: China’s GDP growth grew from 3.0% in CY 2022  to 5.2% in CY 2023, primarily due to higher government  spending. The shakier economic growth recovery of  China in CY 2023 is attributed to depression in the real  estate market and tepid demand. China’s central banks  announced cutting the reserve requirement ratio (RRR)  for all banks by 50 basis points (bps) as part of a slew of  measures to support the fragile economy. United Kingdom: The GDP in the UK contracted from  4.3% in CY 2022 to 0.1% in CY 2023. The decline in growth  reflects tighter monetary policies to curb still-high  inflation and lingering impacts of the terms-of‑trade  shock from high energy prices. Japan: Economic growth in Japan increased to  1.9%  in CY  2023 compared to 1.0% in CY 2022, supported  by pent-up demand, a surge in inbound tourism,  accommodative policies and a rebound in auto exports  that had earlier been held back by supply chain issues. Germany: The GDP growth in Germany decreased from  1.8% in CY 2022 to 0.3% in CY 2023, due to the impact of  high energy prices, weaker industrial demand and higher  interest rates.

The IMF projects sluggish global growth at  3.2% for both CY 2024 and CY 2025. Global headline  inflation is expected to decrease to 5.9% in CY 2024  and 4.5% in CY 2025. Furthermore, according to the  forecast of the Energy Information Administration (EIA),  the Brent crude oil price is expected to average USD 88  per barrel in CY 2024 and USD 85 per barrel in CY 2025.  With the improvement in the economic landscape, the  World Trade Organization predicts a moderate recovery  in global merchandise trade volume, with growth rates  expected to reach 2.6% in CY 2024 and further increase  to 3.3% in CY 2025. The global economic outlook in CY 2024 will be shaped  by elevated interest rates as the fight against inflation  persists, withdrawal of fiscal support amid high  debt weighing on economic activity, low underlying  productivity growth, a tight job market and economic  uncertainties. Furthermore, regional conflicts and  geopolitical unrest could elevate energy prices, reduce  energy supply, or raise the risks of supply disruptions,  contributing to additional geo-economic fragmentation  and posing downside risks for the global economy.  The prolonged Russia-Ukraine conflict has the potential  to further dampen the overall economic outlook of the  European Union. Additionally, an escalation in the Middle  East crisis could impact oil and commodity prices and  the global supply chain. However, positive factors, including rapid disinflation,  strong economic performance of the US and several large  emerging market and developing economies, economic  stimulus in China, the resilience of Europe amid the  ongoing war, and easing of supply chain bottlenecks will  reinforce the outlook of the global economy. After rapid  expansion in CY 2023, the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region is  expected to be the fastest-growing region of the world  economy in CY 2024, supported by robust domestic  demand in East Asia and India. (Source: IMF Economic Outlook, April 2024; World Trade  Organization; S&P Global) Indian Economic  Overview Amid a challenging global economic landscape and  deteriorating geopolitical conditions, India has been  a bright spot. It is the fifth-largest economy in the  world and is poised to retain its position as the world's  fastest-growing  major  economy.  Its  GDP  growth  remained robust at 7.6% in FY 2023-24 as against 7.0%  in FY 2022-23, supported by robust domestic demand,  moderate inflation, a stable interest rate environment,  and strong foreign exchange reserves. Furthermore, an  accelerated pace of economic reforms and increased  capital expenditure facilitated construction activities  and  created  extensive  employment  opportunities  across the country. The International Monetary Fund  (IMF) commended India’s economic resilience, robust  growth, and notable progress in formalisation and  digital infrastructure. India’s G20 presidency in 2023  has demonstrated its capability to cater to global needs  and provided a platform to address global concerns.  India positioned itself as an attractive destination for  investments in energy transition initiatives. Growth of the Indian Economy FY  2021-22 FY  2022-23 FY   2023-24  (E) Real GDP growth (%) 9.1 7.0 7.6 (E - Estimates) (Source: Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation) As per the Second Advance Estimates of National  Income, 2023-24, a double-digit growth rate of 10.7%  in the Construction sector and an 8.5% growth rate in  the Manufacturing sector have contributed to the GDP  growth in FY 2023-24. Moreover, India’s IIP growth  during April-February FY 2023-24 stood at 5.9%, up  from 5.6% in the corresponding period in the previous  year. The Electricity sector recorded a growth of 6.9%.  The Mining and Manufacturing sectors also recorded  a higher growth of 8.2% and 5.4% respectively during  the same period. The growth in gross value added (GVA) at Basic (2011-12)  Prices is pegged at 6.9% in FY 2023-24 as against 6.7%  in FY 2022-23. The Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP)  or GDP at Constant (2011-12) Prices for FY 2023-24 is  estimated to reach ` 172.90 lakh crore, compared to the  First Revised Estimates (FRE) of GDP of ` 160.06 lakh  crore in FY 2022-23. Furthermore, India’s per capita  income is estimated to reach ` 2.14 lakh in FY 2023-24,  achieving remarkable growth of 8.0%. Rising levels of  disposable income have led to an upswing in household  consumption,  thereby  stimulating  demand  across  various sectors. Gross Direct Tax collections (provisional) for FY 2023-24  stood at ` 23.37 lakh crore registering an 18.48% Y-o-Y  growth. Net collections amounted ` 19.58 lakh crore  (provisional), compared to ` 16.64 lakh crore in FY  2022-23, representing an increase of 17.70%.  ===== PAGE 150 ===== ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED 268 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 Despite  a  subdued  external  environment,  India’s  overall trade deficit is estimated to significantly  improve by 35.77% from USD 121.62 billion in  FY 2022-23 to USD  78.12 billion in FY 2023-24.  Merchandise trade deficit improved by 9.33% at  USD 240.17 billion compared to USD 264.90 billion in the  previous fiscal year. Total merchandise exports declined  by 3.10% to USD 437.06 billion in FY 2023-24 compared  to USD 451.07 billion in FY 2022-23. Electronic Goods,  Drugs & Pharmaceuticals, Engineering Goods, Iron Ore,  Cotton  Yarn/Fabric/made-ups,  Handloom  products,  etc., and Ceramic products & glassware were major  contributors to export growth. Merchandise imports  contracted by 5.40% to USD 677.24 billion compared to  USD 715.97 billion in FY 2022-23. A positive trend is observed in CPI inflation, which has  been on a downward trajectory and eased to 4.85% in  March 2024. According to the Reserve Bank of India  (RBI), CPI inflation is estimated at 5.4% for FY 2023-24.  The RBI, in its efforts to control inflation and boost  economic growth, decided to keep the policy repo rate  unchanged at 6.50% and remain vigilant and prepared  to take effective measures to achieve the target  of 4% inflation. The structural interventions implemented by the  government will continue to contribute to the growth  of India's economy. ‘Make in India’ has made significant  achievements and is now focussing on 27 sectors  under ‘Make in India 2.0’. India has reported meteoric  improvement in Ease of Doing Business and ranked 63rd  among 190 countries. As part of the Reducing Compliance  Burden exercise, over 3,600 compliances have been  decriminalised and more than 41,000 compliances have  been reduced to promote Ease of Doing Business and  increase competitiveness. The government has also  implemented investor-friendly Foreign Direct Investment  (FDI) policy, allowing 100% FDI in most sectors through  the automatic route, except for specific strategically  important sectors. These initiatives set the stage for  India's ascent as a prominent global manufacturing hub. (Source: Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation;  Ministry of Finance; RBI; Ministry of Commerce & Industry) Outlook India’s economic outlook is optimistic, with robust  domestic demand, a broad-based revival in manufacturing  and services sectors, increased capital expenditure  and proactive policy measures by the government,  and positive business and consumer sentiments,  providing impetus to the growth momentum going  forward. According to the IMF, the Indian economy is  expected to advance steadily at 6.8% in FY 2024-25  and 6.5% in FY 2025-26. The RBI’s forecast is more  optimistic, projecting a higher GDP growth of 7.0% for   FY 2024-25. As per the Reserve Bank of India's forecast,  CPI inflation is expected to decline to 4.5% in FY 2024-25.  However, volatile food prices hinder the trajectory of  disinflation and obscure the inflation forecast. There are potential risks to India's economic trajectory  stemming from factors such as escalating geopolitical  conflicts, political stability, fluctuations in global  financial markets, geoeconomic fragmentation, and  climate-related shocks. However, India’s favourable  geopolitical positioning enables it to leverage supply  chain diversification and reshoring, enhancing global  competitiveness and boosting exports. Additionally,  the significant increase in capital expenditure for  infrastructure development, with a focus on railway  corridor projects, roads and logistics promises to  revolutionise multi-modal connectivity nationwide and  drive economic growth. India is also striving to achieve sustainability goals  through  decarbonisation  and  leveraging  growing  investment and trade opportunities through enhanced  technology transformation and improved governance  to ensure inclusive and broad-based growth. Amid a  volatile global macro environment, the Indian economy  is poised to emerge as one of the global economic  powerhouses and become the third-largest economy in  the world by 2030. (Source: IMF Economic Outlook, April 2024; Economic Times) Interim Budget FY 2024-25 The Interim Budget 2024-25 outlines a multi-pronged  economic management strategy, including infrastructure  development, digital public infrastructure, taxation  reforms and proactive inflation management. It sets  the foundation for the vision of a Developed India by  2047, focussing on demographic, democratic and  diversity strengths. The government has raised the capital expenditure outlay  by 11.1% to ` 11.1 lakh crore for FY 2024-25, which would  be 3.4% of the GDP. It maintains its focus on defence  modernisation and indigenous manufacturing, with an  increased allocation of ` 6.2 lakh crore for the defence  sector. The allocation for the Ministry of Road Transport  and Highways (MoRTH) increased by 2.8% to ` 2.78 lakh  crore for FY 2024-25. Furthermore, ` 2.55 lakh crore has  been allocated for the Ministry of Railways, surpassing  the previous year's record of ` 2.4 lakh crore. Under the  PM Gati Shakti initiative, three major economic railway  corridor programmes have been identified: energy,  mineral and cement corridors, port connectivity corridors   ===== PAGE 151 ===== 269 Strategic Review Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements and high-traffic density corridors. The development of  these corridors aims to improve logistics efficiency and  reduce costs. The government has also increased the  outlay for the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme  by 33.5% to ` 6,200 crore. The budget places a strong emphasis on sustainable  development and allocates ` 600 crore for the  National Green Hydrogen Mission and ` 8,500 crore  for the development of solar power grid infrastructure.  Furthermore, the initiative 'Pradhan Suryodaya Yojana'  (PMSY) aims to instal rooftop solar power systems in  one crore households, enabling them to obtain up to  300 units of free electricity each month. Moreover, the  budget emphasises expanding and strengthening the  electric vehicle ecosystem by supporting manufacturing  and charging infrastructure. With these measures, the  increased budgetary allocation is poised to foster the  development of a robust ecosystem for renewable energy. (Source: Ministry of Finance) Industry Overview Green Hydrogen Ecosystem Green Hydrogen (GH2) is globally recognised as a key  option in supporting climate ambitions and net-zero  pledges. The volatility of commodity prices in the last few  years has aggravated the urgency of the major economies  to reduce dependence on the fossil fuel. This has also  pushed governments to incentivise hydrogen adoption  by way of supply side stimuli and consumption mandates  to promote hydrogen production. Hydrogen demand  is envisaged to expand beyond fertiliser, chemical, and  refineries chemical Industries to new applications in  heavy industries, long-distance transport, and power  generation. As per International Energy Agency (IEA),  by 2030, hydrogen demand is estimated to increase  by 1.5x to reach more than 150 Mt, with nearly 30% of  that demand coming from new applications. H2 demand  remains concentrated in very selected segments of  industry (like Ammonia production) and refining with  <1% off take of low-emission (green) hydrogen in  existing applications. With the single unified grid and large renewable  capacity potential, Indian government has ambitions  to have the cheapest green hydrogen in the world.  For green hydrogen, the Government of India has set a  production target of 5 MTPA by 2030. This will require an  electrolyser installation capacity of 27–30 GW and nearly  110–130 GW of renewable capacity. However, given the  favourable regulatory policies as well as aggressive  announcements by the corporates, hydrogen production  by 2030 may exceed the target. Industry believes that  driven by technological development, economies of  scale, declining renewable prices, and electrolyser costs  hold promise to make green hydrogen economical in the  future. Based on industry estimates, majority of the cost  for producing green hydrogen is the cost of power used  to produce green hydrogen, and India offers significant  untapped potential to build Renewable Energy (RE)  power capacity. The National Institute of Solar Energy  (NISE) has assessed India's solar energy potential at  748  GW at full capacity, and currently total installed  solar capacity in India sits at 70+GW, i.e., ~10% of its  total potential. Parts of Western Gujarat and Rajasthan  offer the best located sites in India for development of  large-scale RE parks because of the solar radiation and  wind velocity and thus have the potential to become one  of the lowest-cost green hydrogen producing regions. The Indian government has undertaken a series of reforms  aimed at attaining RE and climate change objectives  within specified timelines. Moreover, these reforms  seek to foster domestic production by implementing  trade barriers, safeguarding India’s energy security from  excessive imports. The Government's announcement  of favourable policies and incentives, such as PLI  incentives, National Solar Mission, Central Public  Sector Undertaking scheme, Solar Rooftop Assistance  program, and Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing  of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS),  has attracted substantial investments from domestic  and foreign stakeholders. To enhance self-sufficiency  and moderate reliance on China, the government has  actively encouraged indigenous manufacturers and  facilitated the vertical integration of domestic players.  India launched National Green Hydrogen Mission in early  2023, for the development of green hydrogen production  capacity of at least 5 MTPA with an associated RE  capacity addition of about 125 GW in the country.  India has allocated USD 2.4 billion to initial financing  pool of incentives for producing green hydrogen. Under the Hydrogen policy, the government is offering to  set up manufacturing zones for production, connectivity  to the ISTS (Inter-State Transmission System) on  priority basis, and free transmission for 25 years if the  production facility is commissioned before June 2025.  This means that a green hydrogen producer will be able  to set up a solar power plant in Rajasthan to supply RE  to a green hydrogen plant in distant geography in distant  parts of India, would not be required to pay inter-state  transmission charges. Besides, producers will be allowed  to set up bunkers near ports for storage of green ammonia  for export. Under the Strategic Interventions for Green  Hydrogen Transition Programme (SIGHT), two distinct  financial incentive mechanisms targeting domestic   ===== PAGE 152 ===== ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED 270 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 manufacturing of electrolysers and production of Green  Hydrogen will be provided. With a total installed capacity  of 45.89 GW as on FY24, India’s wind power accounts for  10% of the country’s total installed capacity and 25% of its  total renewable power capacity. India ranks fourth in the  world in terms of installed wind capacity. The government  is preparing to annually allocate approximately 10 GW  of wind projects. These initiatives are directed toward  achieving the ambitious goal of reaching 500 GW in  renewable capacity by 2030. India aspires to meet nearly  half of its electricity requirements through renewable  energy sources by 2030. India has a coastline of about  7,600 km surrounded by seawater on three sides and has  tremendous power generation potential from offshore  wind energy. India has a strong wind potential of around  302 GW at 100m and around 695 GW at 120m above the  ground level. The wind potential is mainly concentrated  in the top 7 windy states including Andhra Pradesh,  Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra,  Rajasthan, and Tamil Nadu. Data Center India's Data Centers industry is witnessing a continuous  uptrend, owing to rapid digitalisation, improving tech  infrastructure, and inclusion of advanced technologies  such as 5G, Artificial Intelligence (AI), blockchain, and  cloud computing. India's growing digital infrastructure,  increasing  technology  penetration,  and  proactive  regulatory push have made it an attractive destination for  Data Centers investments. India hosts ~164 data centers  spread across nine cities. Total installed capacity as of  fiscal 2022 was 550–580 MW and 320-370 MW in fiscal  2020. With the pandemic-induced challenges, digital  transformation became a necessity, and the demand for  hybrid cloud and colocation models surged. Data usage  also increased, creating more demand for data storage  and transformation of the data center industry to a large  and strategically important segment. Digital solutions  being implemented across a range of social and  economic sectors and activities will help make India a  USD 1 trillion digital economy by 2025. In India, data  centers are buoyant in key cities like Mumbai, Chennai,  Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune and Delhi. The Government's  announcement of favourable policies and incentives,  such as data protection bill, rising internet subscriber  base, rising cloud adoption and with rapid adoption of  artificial intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT) and big  data analytics demands for more bandwidth and more  reliable and scalable data centers. By 2025, the number  of IoT devices is expected to reach ~75 million and big  data analytics will reach USD 68 billion. Water In India, use of water is broadly for two purposes:  domestic and industrial usage. The water treatment  industry comprises activities related to the provision  of fresh water and management of wastewater for  commercial/residential  customers  and  industries.  About 1.3 lakh Million Litre Per Day (MLD) of waste water  is estimated to be generated in India in fiscal 2025.  Sewage wastewater is expected to grow @ CAGR of  5-6%, whereas industrial wastewater is expected to grow  @ CAGR of 8-9% between fiscals 2022 and 2025. Rising urbanisation and expansion of industries capacity  along with lack of access to usable water will increase  the demand. The Government has initiated stringent  regulatory norms for Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP),  creating an opportunity for expert players to enter in the  wastewater treatment market. The Central Government  has launched Namami Gange Programme that aims  to develop sewage treatment plants (STPs) with a  capital outlay of ` 25,000 crore. Under the National  Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP), wastewater treatment  plants have been allocated ` 80,000 crore, creating a  huge potential for this growing market. Airports India is the third-largest aviation market and has been  one of the fastest-growing markets in recent years.  Passenger traffic grew at a 13% CAGR over FY09-FY19,  with domestic and international traffic growing at CAGRs  of 14% and 10%, respectively. India's aviation growth  industry is driven by strong underlying economic growth,  increasing per capita income, increased urbanisation,  continued demographic shift, business travel, and  competitive fares. Further, the expansion of airport  capacity and increasing connectivity for Tier 2 / Tier-3  cities are among the other key drivers contributing to  the growth story. This has also driven the modal shift for  travel from rail to air segment. Despite the rapid growth  witnessed in the passenger traffic in India, per capita  penetration is still significantly low versus global average.  India is at 0.13 seats deployed per capita (domestic air  travel penetration) vs. 0.49 for China and 0.57 for Brazil.  Benchmarking of the international seats per capita  for India versus peer countries stands at a much lower  figure. The total fleet operated by all airlines companies  (combined) in India is less than the number of aircraft  run by some global leading airlines. We believe low  penetration of air passenger traffic in India on the back  of growing affordability will continue to be the trigger for  double-digit CAGR in air passenger traffic in India. Over the years, the Indian government has been pushing  for improved connectivity via larger number of airports,   ===== PAGE 153 ===== 271 Strategic Review Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements and overall better aviation infrastructure. The number  of operational airports in India doubled from 74 in 2014  to 148 in 2023 and the Government aspires to take  this to 230-240 by 2030. Among the key Government  initiatives is the Regional Connectivity Scheme — Ude  Desh ka Aam Nagrik (RCS-UDAN) — launched in 2016,  under which 493 routes connecting 75 airports have  been made operational since the launch of the scheme.  The National Civil Aviation Policy (NCAP) in 2016  envisaged regional air connectivity under Regional  Connectivity Scheme (RCS), with the primary objective  to facilitate / stimulate regional air connectivity.  Passenger growth in India, especially at the metro  cities, and custom movement have pushed the airport  infrastructure need for modernisation and expansion.  Indian government moved towards privatising the airport  sector under the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model  in 2005. Privatisation of airports reduces the burden  of investment on Government, and induces operating  efficiencies, improving profitability and competitiveness.  Further, 100% foreign investment has been allowed in  the construction, development, and management of  airports in India, with selective approval from the Foreign  Investment Promotion Board (FIPB). As per the National  Monetization Pipeline (NMP) policy of Government of  India, 25 airports have been identified for monetisation  over next three to five years. Considering the growth  projections for Indian aviation, the Ministry of Civil  Aviation has taken up a key initiative, the Digi Yatra (DY)  programme, to reimagine air travel in the country, which  looks beyond the conventional “build a bigger airport to  manage more passengers” approach. It aims to provide a  seamless, hassle-free and paperless journey experience,  using cutting-edge identity management and facial  recognition technology. Infrastructure Investments in the infrastructure sector as a percentage  of real GDP have increased from 5.9% in fiscal 2018  to 7.3% in fiscal 2022. Infrastructure investments has  been increasing from last 2-3 years as the Government  undertook  widescale  capital  expenditure  in  the  infrastructure segment in order to revive the economy  ravaged by the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Given the  Government’s undeterred thrust towards infrastructure  development, investments in infrastructure are expected  to remain robust going forward. As a matter of fact,  infrastructure investments as a percentage of real GDP  are expected to comfortably cross the 8% mark by fiscal  2025. Roads, power and railways are expected to drive the  bulk of these investments. India has the second-largest  road network in the world, with about 63.32 lakh km as  of FY23. This comprises national highways, expressways,  state highways, major district roads, other district roads,  and village roads. To accelerate the country’s growth,  the development of national highways has been the key  focus area. On the other hand, state highways, district  and rural roads continue to be a large part of the overall  road network. Road transportation, the most common  mode of transportation in India, accounts for about  87% of passenger traffic. Despite having a network  of 1,44,955 km, Indian national highways account for  only 2% of total road network and 40% of total road  traffic. State highways and major district roads make  up the country's secondary road transportation system,  accounting for 60% of traffic and 98% of road length.  The National Highway Development Program (NHDP) is  a significant infrastructure initiative undertaken by the  Government of India to upgrade and expand the country's  road network. CCEA on January 12, 2000 approved NHDP  Phase-I – Four laning of 6,359 km. at a cost of ` 30,300  crore, it aimed to improve connectivity and facilitate  economic growth by enhancing road infrastructure across  the nation. The NHDP encompasses various phases and  components, each targeting different aspects of highway  development, including expansion, modernisation, and  connectivity  enhancement.  Bharatmala  Pariyojana,  India's one of the largest infrastructure program was  envisioned in 2017 to develop 34,800 km of National  Highway corridors, connecting 580+ districts in the  nation. The program signalled a paradigm shift to corridor  approach of infrastructure development. The overall  network of the nation was reimagined through scientific  studies including, Origin - Destination study of freight  movement  across  600  districts  and  crow-flight  alignment for optimised route to reduce transit time.  Bharatmala Pariyojana also ushered in a new age of  technology driven highway development in the country  through deployment of automatic traffic surveys and  satellite mapping and imagery to identify upgradation  requirements  of  corridors.  Bharatmala  Pariyojana  envisages 60% projects on Hybrid Annuity Mode, 10%  projects on BOT (Toll) Mode and 30% projects on EPC  mode respectively. Total aggregate length of 25,713  km with a total capital cost of ` 7,81,845 crore have  been approved and awarded till date under Bharatmala  Pariyojana (including 6,649 km length of residual NHDP  with a total capital cost of ` 1,51,991 crore). Out of the  total approved 25,713 km, EPC, HAM and BOT models  account for 56%, 42% and 2% respectively. The national  highway projects have witnessed a decline in awarding  activity due to lower participation from private players.  However, with an increased focus on Engineering,  Procurement and Construction (EPC) and Hybrid Annuity  Model (HAM) models, the pace of awards of national  highway projects till FY23 grew at a strong pace of   ===== PAGE 154 ===== ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED 272 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 11.41% CAGR over the past 4 years. The investments in  roads sector is expected to grow by a CAGR of around  10-12% during the period FY25-FY28.  Natural Resources India is the second largest coal producer in the world.  Coal deposits are mainly concentrated in eastern  and south-central parts of the country. The states of  Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Madhya  Pradesh, Telangana and Maharashtra account for ~98%  of the total coal reserves in the country. Non-coking coal  consumption is expected to grow at 2-3% CAGR to reach  ~1,105 million tonne by fiscal 2027, driven by growth in  power demand and key end-use industrial segments.  India’s base power demand grew at a 3.6% CAGR from  fiscal 2012 to 2022 to reach ~1,380 billion units.  Growth has been led by economic growth, improvement  in T&D infrastructure coupled with extensive rural  electrification under various schemes. Demand from the  power and non-power sectors such as cement, sponge  iron, aluminium and other industries has led to non-coking  coal consumption increasing at a CAGR of ~4.9% over the  past 10 years. Coking coal, which is mainly used by steel  players for production of steel, grew at a CAGR of ~3.8%  over the past decade, in line with India’s crude steel  production which increased at a CAGR of 4.8% over the  same period. India's domestic coal production increased  at a CAGR of 3.7% over last decade. However, domestic  production could not keep pace with rising demand from  both power and non-power sectors leading to an increase  in both coking and non-coking coal imports at CAGR of  ~3.8% and ~8% over the same period. Consequently,  India has had to increasingly rely on coal imports to  meet domestic coal demand. India’s iron ore demand  is driven by the domestic steel industry. The domestic  consumption of iron ore has moved in line with domestic  steel production over the years, given little change in  scrap usage due to lower availability of scrap in the  domestic market. Further, to boost private participation  in the sector, the Government has been actively taking  steps to open up the mining sector to private enterprises.  Under the same, the Government aims to auction 500  mineral blocks by the end of 2024 as per a plan released  by the Press Information Bureau in 2022. Copper In India, domestic demand for copper and its alloys is  met through domestic production, recycling of scrap,  and imports. Electronic industry is one of the largest  consumers of copper, where it is used in the form of  cables, winding wires. Copper is used in construction  industry  as  plumbing,  taps,  valves,  and  fittings  components. In transportation industry, copper is used  in various components. Copper is extensively used in  industrial machinery and equipment. The per capita  consumption of copper in India in fiscal 2020 was 0.5  kg compared with Russia’s 3.3 kg, China’s 5.4 kg, the  US’s 5.5 kg and the global average of 3.2 kg. Average per  capita consumption of developed economies is ~10  kg. Thus, going forward, the country is expected to  witness healthy domestic consumption. Overall, copper  demand is expected to log 8.5-9.5% CAGR between  fiscals 2023 and 2027 to reach 1,560-1,610 KT, driven by  strong demand from consumer durable, automobile and  construction segments. The demand may see significant  upside depending on renewable energy investments and  electrical vehicles penetration. Petrochemicals India is one of the largest importers of PVC in the world.  With increasing domestic demand and limited production  capacity to cater to the growing needs, Indian players  are dependent on imports for as much as half of their  consumption requirement. Imports are expected to grow  at 6-7% CAGR between fiscals 2022 and 2027 rising to  over 60% of demand in fiscal 2025, at 2,450-2,550 ktpa  (total demand: 3,950-4,050 KTPA). Decline in imports is  expected from fiscal 2026 onwards. Over fiscals 2023  to 2027, PVC demand is expected to clock 8-10% CAGR,  on account of increased spending on infrastructure and  various Government initiatives. The demand would be  driven by sectors such as agriculture with increased land  under irrigation, infrastructure aided by water supply  and sanitation, housing segment with growing focus on  housing for all. Other key segments aiding demand growth  would be pharmaceutical and packaging segments. Defence India is the third largest country in the world based  on defence expenditure, behind the US and China.  Aerospace and defence industry deals with the  manufacturing and supply of aircraft, helicopters,  missiles, radars, satellites, other defence equipment or  components for equipments. The key driving factor for  growth in the industry is capital expenditure on defence  procurement by the Government of India. The capital  outlay portion of India’s defence has been on a rise,  but India’s purchase of defence equipment has been  dominated by imports. To make the defence sector  more self-reliant, the Ministry of Defence has given  fresh impetus on indigenisation by signing a number of  contracts with domestic players.

No. Material  issue  identified Indicate  whether  risk or  opportunity  (R/O) Rationale for identifying  the risk / opportunity In case of risk, approach to  adapt or mitigate Financial  implications of the  risk or opportunity  (Indicate the  positive/negative  implications) 1 Employee  Health,  Safety and  Well-Being Risk Failure to ensure the health,  safety and well-being of the  Company’s workforce can  impact productivity. This  can  consequently  affect  our  business  operations,  customer satisfaction and  profitability The  Company  strives  to  foster  a  safe  working  environment and ensure Zero  Harm. Hazards and risks are  periodically identified, with  mitigation plans devised for  each.  Additionally,  safety  trainings  are  provided  to  employees and workers on  regular basis to ensure their  holistic well-being. Negative 2 Community  Development Opportunity Community  development  activities help the Company  to create a positive impact  on society by undertaking  meaningful  interventions  to bring significant benefits  to large sections of society.  The CSR efforts also help  foster a more productive and  positive work environment  for employees. The Adani Foundation has  been  striving  to  create  sustainable  opportunities  for  the  marginalized  communities by facilitating  quality education, sustainable  livelihood  development,  promoting a healthy society  and  supporting  rural  infrastructure  development.  The  Adani  Foundation’s  outreach  as  of  now  has  been to 6,769 villages in 19  States across India positively  impacting 9.1 million lives. With an aim to contribute  to the holistic development  of communities, the Adani  Foundation is contributing to  the global agenda of meeting  Sustainable  Development  Goals (SDGs). Positive 3 Ecological  Impact Risk Reducing the Company’s  ecological impact is crucial  to  mitigating  climate  change and the physical  and transition risks that  accompany it. AEL has implemented a range  of policies such as the Climate  Change  Policy,  Resource  Conservation  Policy,  Water  Stewardship  Policy,  and  Energy Management Policy,  with the aim of minimizing its  ecological footprint.

No. Material  issue  identified Indicate  whether  risk or  opportunity  (R/O) Rationale for identifying  the risk / opportunity In case of risk, approach to  adapt or mitigate Financial  implications of the  risk or opportunity  (Indicate the  positive/negative  implications) 4 Business  Ethics,  Integrity and  Transparency Risk Ethical conduct, integrity  and  transparent  two- way communication with  stakeholders are integral  to  ensuring  regulatory  compliance  and  building  stakeholder trust.  Nonadherence to business  ethics and integrity related  compliance  obligations  can lead to legal fines  and  penalties,  financial  forfeiture, damage to brand  reputation, loss of business  opportunities and valuation. We adhere to the highest  standards  when  it  comes  to personal and collective  integrity,  reflected  by  compliance  with  the  standards stipulated by the  government, other regulatory  agencies, and peer global  standards. Over the years, we  have  further  strengthened  our commitment to gender  respect,  zero  tolerance  for  sexual  harassment,  zero  tolerance  on  ethical  transgressions,  commitment  to recruit without prejudice  and  appraise  without  partialness,  respect  for  the dignity of people and  environment  integrity  and  respect for the laws of the  lands of our presence. The  Company  has  also  formulated and implemented a  Code of Business Conduct and  Ethics for all its Board members  and  senior  management  personnel,  in  compliance  with corporate governance  requirements as per the SEBI  Listing  Regulations.  Apart  from this, Adani Group’s Code  of Conduct is also applicable  to all employees across Adani  Group, including the Company. Negative 5 Human  Rights Risk Failing to address human  rights  issues  can  risk  damaging brand value and  reputation and can also  bring an increasing risk  of litigation and of non- compliance with a growing  body of legislation in the  area. The Company has constituted  a standing forum that aids and  advises the management in its  approach  towards  building  sustainable  Human  Rights.  Group HR through Business HR  is responsible to ensure that  any issue or impact related to  human rights are addressed in  the defined manner within the  stipulated timeline.

No. Material  issue  identified Indicate  whether  risk or  opportunity  (R/O) Rationale for identifying  the risk / opportunity In case of risk, approach to  adapt or mitigate Financial  implications of the  risk or opportunity  (Indicate the  positive/negative  implications) 6 Water  management Risk We are directly affected  by  the  availability  and  quality of water considering  the  nature  of  business  operations. Water scarcity  can interrupt our business  operations, disrupt supply  chains, raise the costs of  raw  materials,  and  put  employee’s and community’s  health and safety at risk.  It may also lead to loss of  social license to operate due  to competition for water  with local communities. As water is material to our  operations,  it  becomes  a  business imperative for us to  optimize its consumption and  move towards water security.  Reduction  of  freshwater  consumption, water recycling/ reusing  and  water  saving  initiatives are part of our water  management  strategy.  We  have also instituted a Water  Stewardship  Policy,  which  serves as a guiding principle to  reduce consumption of water  in the operation and conserve  water wherever feasible. Negative 7 Waste  Management Risk Waste  management  has  become  a  global  issue  impacting the environment  and health of the people.  Industries  are  one  of  the large generators of  hazardous waste and are  directed by the pollution  control board (PCB) for  waste  management  practices. Not abiding to  the  practices  prescribed  the PCBs may lead to legal  penalties and impact the  brand image. At AEL level, we have instituted  a Waste Management as well  as a Resource Conservation  Policy, which serve as guiding  principles to reduce generation  of waste, treat the waste, and  dispose  in  environmentally  friendly manner. The Company  has defined processes for  managing waste at each of its  sites/ locations. We follow the  basic principle of segregation  of the waste at source & adopt  the 3R concept of “reduce,  reuse & recycle”. Negative 8 Energy and  Emissions  management Risk /  Opportunity Considering  India’s  commitment  to  become  NET  ZERO  by  2070,  stringent  energy  and  emission related laws and  regulations may be enacted  for companies to follow. If  as a Company we are not  prepared in time to comply  with these emerging laws  and regulations, we may  face additional unexpected  cost to comply as a result  of not timely anticipating to  the new requirements.  The energy-intensive nature  of our business operations  not only drives us towards  energy saving measures but  also directs us to increase the  share of clean energy in our  overall energy mix. We also  have an Energy Management  Policy, designed to aid and  formalize  the  Company’s  efforts to manage its energy  consumption and emissions,  integrate renewable energy  sources  wherever  feasible,  and adopt efficient ways of  energy usage.  Negative / Positive  ===== PAGE 222 ===== ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED 340 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 S.  No. Material  issue  identified Indicate  whether  risk or  opportunity  (R/O) Rationale for identifying  the risk / opportunity In case of risk, approach to  adapt or mitigate Financial  implications of the  risk or opportunity  (Indicate the  positive/negative  implications) Business  restrictions  leading to loss of revenue  and/or  additional  costs  may also force our business  to change our business  model. Energy is one of the  major overhead costs for  our  business  operations.  There is an opportunity to  make cost savings through  implementing  various  energy efficiency projects  such as using high energy  efficient equipment, on-site  renewables  installations,  wherever  feasible,  etc.  which  not  only  reduce  carbon emissions but also  deliver cost savings. We  expect that our ambition  to  eliminate  direct  greenhouse gas emissions  from operations will not  only lower overhead costs  but will improve resilience  in our energy supply and  attract investors who are  increasingly  considering  carbon emission as a risk.  This may also help us to  identify  new  business  opportunities in the clean  technologies  sector.  Establishment  of  Adani  New Industries Limited as a subsidiary of the Company and an investment plan of around $100 billion across the energy transition value chain  by  Adani  Group’s businesses,  signals  our commitment. To accomplish our goals of  resource  conservation,  we  regularly monitor our energy  performance  at  all  our  operating units.  ===== PAGE 223 ===== 341 Strategic Review Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements S.  No. Material  issue  identified Indicate  whether  risk or  opportunity  (R/O) Rationale for identifying  the risk / opportunity In case of risk, approach to  adapt or mitigate Financial  implications of the  risk or opportunity  (Indicate the  positive/negative  implications) 9 Labor  Practices Risk /  Opportunity Risk:  Failing to manage sound  labor management  practices can lead to  prosecution by regulators,  insurance claims due to  accidents and injuries,  reduce employee  motivation in turn leading  to loss of productivity and  also hamper the brand  image and reputation. Opportunity: Ensuring sound labour  practices allows the  organisation to avoid  regulatory action, penalties  and empower its employees  and workers. We  remain  committed  to providing a safe work  environment  for  our  employees,  contractual  workers,  visitors  and  the  community  at  large.  We  have adopted Adani Group's  Safety Mgt. System which  focusses on the improvement  of  working  conditions,  working environment and the  protection and promotion of  workers’ health.  We have implemented a robust  Contract Labour Management  System and the registration  process  ensures  that  the  entire contractual workforce  is above legal minimum age  for employment as defined by  the legal authority. We also  have a grievance redressal  process at our locations for  our employees. The Company  adheres to all the laws of the  land, related to human rights  and labour practices. Negative / Positive 10 Climate  Change  Adaption and  Mitigation Risk /  Opportunity Climate  change-related  regulations  focused  on  mitigation  (e.g.  carbon  pricing) have a direct impact  on AEL business. Emerging  and potential regulations  may introduce or escalate  regulatory risks.  . AEL has emission intensive  businesses. AEL draws on  input from subject matter  experts as and when required  to  identify  and  manage  exposure to risks and impacts  associated  with  emerging  regulations.  Impacts  to  business considered include  regulatory/legal  impacts,  health, safety, environment  and community impacts, and  reputational impacts.

No. Material  issue  identified Indicate  whether  risk or  opportunity  (R/O) Rationale for identifying  the risk / opportunity In case of risk, approach to  adapt or mitigate Financial  implications of the  risk or opportunity  (Indicate the  positive/negative  implications) We see Climate change also  as an opportunity for us as  the  low-carbon  transition  creates  opportunities  for  efficiency,  innovation  and  growth. Through investment  and clean technologies, AEL  businesses can save energy  and materials costs, serve  new customer needs, enhance  their reputations and better  attract and retain talent - all  as a consequence of working  to reduce their emissions and  those of their customers and  suppliers. Establishment of  Adani New Industries Limited  as a subsidiary of the Company  and an investment plan of  around $100 billion across the  energy transition value chain  by Adani Group’s businesses,  signals our commitment. 11 Responsible  Supply Chain Opportunity Organizations  are  under  increased  pressure  from  investors, customers, and  regulators  to  mitigate  environmental, social and  governance  (ESG)  risk  exposures  within  their  supply chain. Not having  sustainable  supply  chain  management practices, a  company may be exposed  to  more  risks  including  labor disruptions, workforce  health and safety incidents,  human rights issues, and  shortages of raw materials. At AEL, we see responsible  supply chain as an opportunity,  as considering sustainability  in selecting and maintaining  suppliers, we can effectively  reduce overall risk, improve  our brand equity, and attract  new  clientele  including  investors and top talent.

These measures are then diligently  tracked, monitored, and ultimately resolved. 	 	 Insights and lessons derived from these occurrences are disseminated throughout the Group via a structured  mechanism known as the 'Critical Vulnerable Factor' (CVF), integral to the Group's Safety Governance  Process. The advancement of CVF initiatives is regularly evaluated at the Adani Apex Group Safety Steering  Council and Business Safety Council Meetings. 	 	 Supporting these processes, the Adani Group has introduced a digital platform for Occupational Health and  Safety (OH&S) reporting.

In our Airports business, regular safety audits and  inspections are conducted to detect any hazards or unsafe conditions present in the workplace, followed by the  implementation of appropriate measures to eradicate these hazards. Additionally, we maintain a rigorous work  permit system and conduct various programs like Toolbox talks, task briefings, job-specific training, job safety  analysis, and mock drills, all contributing to the cultivation of a safety culture across our enterprises. We promote active engagement and participation from our employees in safety-related activities.

Describe the strategy  adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes  and the practices adopted to manage such wastes. 	 Our waste management approach is anchored in the cradle-to-cradle philosophy, emphasizing the principles  of Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repurpose, and Recycle to reintegrate waste into the ecosystem. This process is  structured into five distinct phases: Identification, Storage, Segregation, Recycling, and Disposal. We employ  premier waste management practices, which are a fundamental component of our comprehensive environmental  management system. Additionally, we have instituted a Resource Conservation policy, which has been successfully  operationalized across various AEL entities. 	 In managing hazardous waste, we rigorously comply with all relevant regulatory mandates and embrace  industry-leading practices. This encompasses meticulous segregation, secure storage, and safe transportation  of hazardous materials. Consistent with regulatory directives, we ensure the environmentally sound disposal of  hazardous waste by engaging certified vendors proficient in recycling such materials. 	 All of our enterprises are diligently pursuing Zero Waste to Landfill certification where feasible. Alongside hazardous  waste, we manage significant non-hazardous waste streams, including mining overburden, scrap metal, wood,  glass, tires, electronic waste, cardboard, and paper. The overburden is entirely utilized within our mining lease  areas for backfilling and ecological restoration. Our strategic goal is to reduce or eradicate waste production and  redirect waste away from disposal by encouraging reuse and recycling when possible. At Adani Solar, we sell ETP  Chemical sludge to other industries for use as a raw material. Mumbai Airport has achieved 100% SUP-free status,  certified by CII. At Thiruvananthapuram International Airport, we've implemented an advanced Bioenergy Plant  that converts biogas into electricity with a 15 KVA Biogas Genset, powering the airport operations. The resultant  biogas slurry serves as fertilizer for horticultural activities. Furthermore, at Mumbai and Ahmedabad Airports,  we've placed three Reverse Vending Machines to promote recycling among passengers and staff, each capable  of accepting and compressing up to 450 bottles per hour, reducing waste volume by approximately 70% for  efficient transport to recycling facilities. 	 These initiatives in waste management are part of our commitment to lessen the environmental footprint of our  activities and promote the sustainable utilization of resources. 11. If the entity has operations/offices in/around ecologically sensitive areas (such as national parks, wildlife  sanctuaries, biosphere reserves, wetlands, biodiversity hotspots, forests, coastal regulation zones etc.) where  environmental approvals / clearances are required, please specify details in the following format: Sr. No. Location of operations/offices Type of operations Whether the conditions of  environmental approval / clearance  are being complied with?

In our opinion and to the best of our information and  according to the explanations given to us, except for  the possible effects of the matters described in the  ‘Basis for Qualified Opinion’ section of our report, the  aforesaid standalone financial statements give the  information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the  Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair  view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards  prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the  Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015,  as amended, (“Ind AS”) and other accounting principles  generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of  the Company as at March 31, 2024, the Profit and other  comprehensive Income, changes in equity and its cash  flows for the year ended on that date. Basis for Qualified Opinion As described in Note 45(j) to the accompanying  Standalone Financial Statements, on account of pending  adjudications / outcome of the investigations by the  Securities and Exchange Board of India and based on our  review of related documents, we are unable to comment  on the possible adjustments and /or disclosures, if any,  that may be required to be made in the accompanying  Standalone Financial Statements in respect of this matter.  We will continue to evaluate the impact of this matter on  our opinion based on any changes in circumstances or  additional information that may become available. Our audit report for the previous year ended March 31,  2023 was also qualified in respect of this matter. We conducted our audit of the standalone financial  statements in accordance with the Standards on  Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act  (SAs). Our responsibilities under those Standards are  further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the  Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements section  of our report. We are independent of the Company in  accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute  of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”) together with  the independence requirements that are relevant to our  audit of the standalone financial statements under the  provisions of the Act and the Rules made there under,  and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities  in accordance with these requirements and the Code  of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have  obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a  basis for our qualified audit opinion on the standalone  financial statements. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our  professional judgment, were of most significance in  our audit of the standalone financial statements of the  current year. These matters were addressed in the context  of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a  whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not  provide a separate opinion on these matters.  ===== PAGE 263 ===== 381 Strategic Review Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements In addition to the matter described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion section we have determined the matters  described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. Sr.  No. Key Audit Matters Auditor’s Response 1 Contingencies relating to taxation, litigations and  arbitrations The provisions and contingent liabilities relate to  ongoing litigations and claims with various authorities  and third parties. These relate to direct tax, indirect  tax, claims and other general legal proceedings  arising in the ordinary course of business. As at the  year ended March 31, 2024, the amounts involved  were significant. The assessment of a provision or  a contingent liability requires significant judgement  by the management of the Company because of the  inherent complexity in estimating future costs. The  amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate  of the expenditure. The provisions and contingent  liabilities are subject to changes in the outcomes of  litigations and claims and the positions taken by the  management of the Company. It involves significant  judgement and estimation to determine the likelihood  and timing of the cash outflows and interpretations  of the legal aspects, tax legislations and judgements  previously made by authorities. Principal Audit Procedures We have obtained an understanding of the process  followed by the management of the Company for  assessment and determination of the amounts  of provisions and contingent liabilities relating to  taxation, litigations and arbitrations. We have made inquiries about the status in respect  of significant provisions and contingent liabilities  with the Company’s internal tax and legal team,  including challenging the assumptions and critical  judgements made by the Company which impacted  the computation of the provisions and inspecting the  computation. We assessed management’s conclusions through  discussions held with their in-house legal counsel  and understanding precedents in similar cases. We  communicated with the company’s external legal  counsel on the certain material litigations to establish  the likelihood of outflow of economic resources  being probable, possible or remote in respect of the  litigations. We have involved subject matter experts with  specialized skills and knowledge to assist in the  assessment of the value of significant provisions  and contingent liabilities relating to the pending  litigations, on sample basis, in light of the nature of  the exposures, applicable regulations and related  correspondence with the authorities. We also assessed and validated the adequacy and  appropriateness of the disclosures made by the  management in the standalone financial statements.  ===== PAGE 264 ===== ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED 382 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 Sr.  No. Key Audit Matters Auditor’s Response 2 Timing of Revenue recognition and adjustments for  coal quality variances involving critical estimates Material estimation by the Company is involved in  recognition and measurement of its revenue. The  value and timing of revenue recognition for sale of  goods varies from contract to contract, and the  activity can span beyond the year end. Revenue from sale of goods is recognized when  control is transferred to the customers and when  there are no other unfulfilled obligations. This  requires detailed analysis of each sale agreement/  contract /customer purchase order regarding timing  of revenue recognition. Inappropriate assessment could lead to a risk of  revenue being recognized on sale of goods before the  control in the goods is transferred to the customer. Subsequent adjustments are made to the transaction  price due to grade mismatch/slippage of the  transferred goods (coal). The variation in the contract  price if not settled mutually between the parties to  the contract is referred to third party testing and  the Company estimates the adjustments required  for revenue recognition pending settlement of such  dispute. Such adjustments in revenue are made on  estimated basis following historical trend. Inappropriate estimation could lead to a risk of revenue  being overvalued or undervalued. Accordingly, timing  of recognition of revenue and adjustments for coal  quality variances involving critical estimates is a key  audit matter. Principal Audit Procedures We have assessed the Company’s accounting policies  for revenue recognition in accordance with the  applicable accounting standards i.e Ind AS 115; We have conducted testing of design, implementation  and operating effectiveness of key internal financial  controls over timing of recognition of revenue from  sale of goods and subsequent adjustments made to  the transaction price; We have also performed substantive audit procedures  on selected statistical samples of customer contracts,  verified terms and condition related to acceptance of  goods, acknowledgement on delivery receipts and  tested the transit time to deliver the goods and its  revenue recognition. Our tests of details focused on  period end samples to verify only revenue pertaining  to current year is recognized based on terms and  conditions set out in sale agreements/ contracts  and delivery documents. We have assessed the  appropriateness of the estimated adjustments in the  process. We also performed tests to establish the basis  of estimation of the consideration and whether such  estimates are commensurate with the accounting  policy of the Company. We have reviewed the calculations and adequacy of  the provision for coal quality variances. We verified  the methodology used for estimating the provision  and assess the reasonable of assumption. We have assessed the adequacy of disclosure in the  standalone financial statements. 3 Measurement of inventory quantities of coal As at March 31, 2024 the Company has coal inventory  of ` 2,980.57 Crores. This was determined a key  audit matter, as the measurement of these inventory  quantities lying at the ports/ yards involves significant  judgement and estimate resulting from measuring the  surface area. The Company uses internal and external  experts, to perform volumetric assessments, basis  which the quantity for these inventories is estimated. Principal Audit Procedures We have obtained an understanding and have  evaluated the design and operating effectiveness  of controls over physical count and measurement of  such inventory; We have evaluated the competency and capabilities  of management’s experts for quantification of the  inventories on sample basis. We have physically observed inventory measurement  and count procedures carried out by management  using experts spanning over our engagement period,  to ensure its appropriateness and completeness; and Our audit procedures also included obtaining and  inspecting, inventory measurement and physical  count results for such inventories, including assessing  and evaluating the results of analysis performed by  management in respect of differences between book  and physical quantities. We have also verified that  the physical verification differences are appropriately  accounted for in the books of accounts.  ===== PAGE 265 ===== 383 Strategic Review Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements Sr.  No. Key Audit Matters Auditor’s Response 4 Significant judgement relating to impairment of  investments in subsidiaries, associates and jointly  controlled entities The Company has major investments in subsidiaries,  associates and jointly controlled entities aggregating  to ` 14,070.92 Crores as at March 31, 2024. The  Management assesses at least annually the existence  of impairment indicators of each shareholding in such  subsidiaries, associate and jointly controlled entities. The process and methodologies for assessing  and determining the recoverable amount of each  investments are based on the complex assumptions,  that by their nature imply the use of Management’s  judgement,  in  particular  with  reference  to  identification of impairment indicators, forecasting  future cashflow relating to period covered by the  Company’s strategic business plan, normalized  cashflow assumed as a basis for terminal values, as  well as the long term growth rates and discount rates  applied to such forecasted cash flow. Considering the judgement required for estimating  the cash flows and complexity of the assumptions  used, this is considered as a Key Audit Matter.  Principal Audit Procedures We obtained understanding of the Company’s policy  on assessment of impairment of investment in  subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities  and assumptions used by the Management including  design and implementation of controls. We have  tested operating effectiveness of those controls. We have assessed the methodology used by the  Management of the company to estimate recoverable  value of each investment and consistency with the  relevant Ind AS. We compared the carrying value of the Company’s  investment in these subsidiaries, associates and  jointly controlled entities with their respective net  asset values as per the audited financial statements. With respect to the cases where indicators of  impairment were identified by the Management,  we obtained the projected future cash flows along  with sensitivity analysis thereof with respect to  relevant investments. We evaluated management’s  methodology, assumptions and estimates used in the  calculation and have involved subject matter expert  internally to evaluate the appropriateness of the  assumptions used. We evaluated the appropriateness of its accounting  and the disclosures, if any, for the impairment of  investment. 5 Discontinued Operations and Asset held for sale in  relation to Transfer of Power Trading Business During the current year, the Company, in its Board  Meeting held on 22nd March 2024, approved the  transfer/sale of its Power Trading Business as a  going concern. As at March 31, 2024, the Company  has presented the operations under Power Trading  business as “Discontinued Operations” and its related  assets as “Assets held for sale” and liabilities as  “Liabilities associated with the assets held for sale” in  accordance with Ind AS 105 (Non-current Assets held  for Sale and Discontinued Operations). Accounting  for discontinued operations requires judgment to  identify and separate the relevant financial effects  from  continuing  and  discontinued  operations.  Accordingly, this matter has been determined to be  a key audit matter in our audit of the standalone  financial statements Principal Audit Procedures Obtained an understanding and assessed the  effectiveness of process followed by the management  in assessing the appropriateness of the Company’s  accounting policies in relation to discontinued  operations. Evaluated the basis of the management’s assessment  of treating the transfer of Power Trading business  as Discontinued operations in accordance with the  applicable accounting standards. Obtained and read the Board Resolution for  understanding the impact on the standalone Ind AS  financial statements including identification of the  assets and liabilities to be transferred and assessment  of the key estimates and judgement involved therein. Performed procedures on the disclosures relating  to discontinued operations and assets held for sale,  made in the standalone Ind AS financial statements  for  assessing  the  compliance  with  disclosure  requirements.  ===== PAGE 266 ===== ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED 384 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 Information other than the Financial Statements  and Auditor’s Report thereon The Company’s management and Board of Directors are  responsible for the preparation of the other information.  The other information comprises the information  included in the Management Discussion and Analysis,  Board’s Report including Annexure to Board’s Report,  Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report,  Corporate Governance and Shareholder’s Information,  but  does  not  include  the  standalone  financial  statements, consolidated financial statement and our  audit reports thereon. Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does  not cover the other information and we do not express  any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the standalone financial  statements, our responsibility is to read the other  information and, in doing so, consider whether the  other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the  course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially  misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we  conclude that there is a material misstatement of this  other information, we are required to report that fact.  We have nothing to report in this regard. Management’s  and  Board  of  Director’s  Responsibility  for  the  Standalone  Financial  Statements The Company’s Management and the Board of Directors  are responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5)  of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) with respect to  the preparation and presentation of these Standalone  Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of  the financial position, financial performance including  other comprehensive income, cash flows and changes  in equity of the Company in accordance with the  accounting principles generally accepted in India,  including the applicable Indian Accounting Standards  (Ind AS) prescribed under Section 133 of the Act, read  with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)  Rules, 2015, as amended. This  responsibility  also  includes  maintenance  of  adequate accounting records in accordance with the  provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of  the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds  and other irregularities; selection and application of  appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and  estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design,  implementation and maintenance of adequate internal  financial controls, that were operating effectively  for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the  accounting records, relevant to the preparation and  presentation of the Standalone Financial Statements  that give a true and fair view and are free from material  misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, the  management and the Board of Directors are responsible  for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a  going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related  to going concern and using the going concern basis  of accounting unless management either intends to  liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no  realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing  the Company’s financial reporting process. Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the  Standalone Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance  about whether the standalone financial statements as  a whole are free from material misstatement, whether  due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that  includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high  level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit  conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect  a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements  can arise from fraud or error and are considered  material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could  reasonably be expected to influence the economic  decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone  financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise  professional  judgment  and  maintain  professional  skepticism throughout the audit. We also: 	 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement  of the standalone financial statements, whether  due to fraud or error, design and perform audit  procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain  audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate  to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not  detecting a material misstatement resulting from  fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,  as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional  omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of  internal control. 	 Obtain an understanding of internal financial  controls relevant to the audit in order to design  audit procedures that are appropriate in the  circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act,  we are also responsible for expressing our opinion   ===== PAGE 267 ===== 385 Strategic Review Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements on whether the Company has adequate internal  financial controls system in place and the operating  effectiveness of such controls. 	 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies  used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates  and related disclosures made by management. 	 Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s  use of the going concern basis of accounting and,  based on the audit evidence obtained, whether  a material uncertainty exists related to events or  conditions that may cast significant doubt on the  Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists,  we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s  report to the related disclosures in the standalone  financial statements or, if such disclosures are  inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions  are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the  date of our auditor’s report. However, future events  or conditions may cause the Company to cease to  continue as a going concern. 	 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and  content of the standalone financial statements,  including  the  disclosures,  and  whether  the  standalone financial statements represent the  underlying transactions and events in a manner that  achieves fair presentation. We communicate with those charged with governance  regarding, among other matters, the planned scope  and timing of the audit and significant audit findings,  including any significant deficiencies in internal control  that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with  a statement that we have complied with relevant  ethical requirements regarding independence, and to  communicate with them all relationships and other  matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our  independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged  with governance, we determine those matters that  were of most significance in the audit of the standalone  financial statements of the current year and are  therefore the key audit matters. We describe these  matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation  precludes public disclosure about the matter or when,  in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that  a matter should not be communicated in our report  because the adverse consequences of doing so would  reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest  benefits of such communication.

We have audited the internal financial controls over  financial reporting of Adani Enterprises Limited (“the  Company”) as of March 31, 2024 in conjunction with  our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the  company for the year ended on that date. Management’s  and  Board  of  Director’s  Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls The Company’s Management and the Board of Directors  are responsible for establishing and maintaining  internal financial controls based on the internal control  over financial reporting criteria established by the  Company considering the essential components of  internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit  of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting  issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of  India (ICAI). These responsibilities include the design,  implementation and maintenance of adequate internal  financial controls that were operating effectively  for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its  business, including adherence to company’s policies, the  safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection  of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness  of the accounting records, and the timely preparation  of reliable financial information, as required under the  Companies Act, 2013. Auditors’ Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the  Company’s internal financial controls over financial  reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in  accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal  Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (“the  Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing, issued  by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under section  143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent  applicable to an audit of internal financial controls and,  both issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants  of India. Those Standards and the Guidance Note  require that we comply with ethical requirements  and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether adequate internal financial  controls over financial reporting was established and  maintained and if such controls operated effectively in  all material respects. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit  evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial  controls system over financial reporting and their  operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial  controls over financial reporting included obtaining  an understanding of internal financial controls over  financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material  weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design  and operating effectiveness of internal control based  on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend  on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of  the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone  Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained  is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for  our audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial  controls system over financial reporting with reference  to standalone financial statements. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over  Financial Reporting A company’s internal financial control over financial  reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable  assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting  and the preparation of Standalone financial statements  for external purposes in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal  financial control over financial reporting includes those  policies and procedures that (1)	 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in  reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect  the transactions and dispositions of the assets  of the company; (2)	 provide reasonable assurance that transactions  are recorded as necessary to permit preparation  of Standalone financial statements in accordance  with generally accepted accounting principles, and  that receipts and expenditures of the company are  being made only in accordance with authorizations  of management and directors of the company; and (3)	 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention  or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,  use, or disposition of the company’s assets that  could have a material effect on the financial statements. Annexure – B to the Independent Auditor’s Report  ===== PAGE 277 ===== 395 Strategic Review Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial  Controls over Financial Reporting Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial  controls over financial reporting, including the possibility  of collusion or improper management override of controls,  material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur  and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation  of the internal financial controls over financial reporting  to future years are subject to the risk that the internal  financial control over financial reporting may become  inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that  the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures  may deteriorate. Opinion In our opinion the company has, in all material aspects,  an adequate internal financial controls system over  financial reporting and such internal financial controls  over financial reporting were operating effectively as  at 31st March, 2024, based on the internal control over  financial reporting criteria established by the Company  considering the essential components of internal control  stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial  Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute  of Chartered Accountants of India.

Corporate Information 	 Adani Enterprises Limited (‘the Company’, ‘AEL’)  is a listed public company domiciled in India and  incorporated under the provisions of Companies  Act, 1956, having its registered office at “Adani  Corporate  House”,  Shantigram,  Near  Vaishno  Devi Circle, S. G. Highway, Khodiyar, Ahmedabad  - 382421, Gujarat, India. Its shares are listed on  the BSE Limited and National Stock Exchange of  India Limited. The Company is in the business of  integrated resources management, mining services  and other trading activities. The Company operates  as an incubator, establishing new businesses in  various areas like new energy ecosystem, data  center, airports, roads, copper, digital space, Food  FMCG and others. 2.	 Material Accounting Policies I	 Basis of Preparation a)	 Statement of Compliance 	 The financial statements of the Company have been  prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting  Standards (Ind AS) notified under section 133 of  the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies  (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as  amended from time to time and other accounting  principles generally accepted in India. 	 These financial statements have been prepared  under the historical cost convention with the  exception of certain assets and liabilities that are  required to be carried at fair values by Ind AS. 	 The financial statements are presented in INR except  when otherwise stated. All amounts have been  rounded-off to the nearest crore, unless otherwise  indicated and amounts less than ` 50,000/- have  been presented as ''0.00''. b)	 Significant accounting judgements, accounting  estimates and assumptions 	 The preparation of financial statements requires  management to make certain judgements, estimates  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of  revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities (including  contingent  liabilities)  and  the  accompanying  disclosures. Estimates and underlying assumptions  are reviewed on an ongoing basis. 	 Key sources of estimation uncertainty 	 The key assumptions concerning the future and  other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the  reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing  a material adjustment to the carrying amounts  of assets and liabilities within the next financial  years, are described below. Existing circumstances  and assumptions about future developments may  change due to market changes or circumstances  arising that are beyond the control of the Company.  Such changes are reflected in the assumptions  when they occur. 	 Material estimates and assumptions are required  in particular for: 	 i)	 Useful life of property, plant and equipment  and intangible assets: 	 	 This involves determination of the estimated  useful life of property, plant and equipment  and intangible assets and the assessment  as to which components of the cost may be  capitalised. Useful life of these assets is based  on the life prescribed in Schedule II to the  Companies Act, 2013 or based on technical  estimates, taking into account the nature of  the asset, estimated usage, expected residual  values, anticipated technological changes,  maintenance support and operating conditions  of the asset. Management reviews its estimate  of the useful lives of depreciable/ amortisable  assets at each reporting date, based on the  expected utility of the assets. 	 ii)	 Impairment of Non Financial Asset : 	 	 Impairment exists when the carrying value  of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds  its recoverable amount, which is the higher  of its fair value less costs of disposal and  its value in use. The fair value less costs of  disposal calculation is based on available data  for similar assets or observable market prices  less incremental costs for disposing of the  asset. The value in use calculation is based  on a discounted future cashflows model.  The recoverable amount is sensitive to the  discount rate used for the discounted future  cashflows model as well as the expected future  cash-inflows and the growth rate used.  ===== PAGE 285 ===== Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 403 Strategic Review Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 	 iii)	 Taxes: 	 	 The Company’s tax jurisdiction is India.  Significant  judgements  are  involved  in  estimating budgeted profits for the purpose of  paying advance tax, determining the provision  for income taxes, including amount expected to  be paid/recovered for uncertain tax positions.  Significant management judgement is also  required to determine the amount of deferred  tax assets that can be recognised, based upon  the likely timing and the level of future taxable  profits together with future tax planning  strategies, including estimates of temporary  differences reversing on account of available  benefits from the Income Tax Act, 1961. 	 iv)	 Fair  value  measurement  of  financial  instruments: 	 	 In estimating the fair value of financial assets  and financial liabilities, the Company uses  market observable data to the extent available.  Where such Level 1 inputs are not available,  the Company establishes appropriate valuation  techniques and inputs to the model. The inputs  to these models are taken from observable  markets where possible, but where this is not  feasible, a degree of judgment is required in  establishing fair values. Judgments include  considerations of inputs such as liquidity  risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in  assumptions about these factors could affect  the reported fair value of financial instruments. 	 v)	 Defined benefit plans (Gratuity Benefits): 	 	 The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan  and the present value of the gratuity obligation  are determined using actuarial valuations.  An actuarial valuation involves making various  assumptions that may differ from actual  developments in the future. These include  the determination of the discount rate, future  salary increases, attrition rate and mortality  rates. Due to the complexities involved in the  valuation and its long-term nature, a defined  benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes  in these assumptions. All assumptions are  reviewed at each reporting date. 	 vi)	 Inventory Measurement 	 	 Measurement of bulk inventory quantities of  coal lying at port/ yards is material, complex and  involves significant judgement and estimate  resulting from measuring the surface area.  The Company performs physical counts of above  inventory on a periodic basis using internal /  external experts to perform volumetric surveys  and assessments, basis which the estimate of  quantity for these inventories is determined.  The variations noted between book records and  physical quantities of above inventories are  evaluated and appropriately accounted in the  books of accounts. 	 vii)	 Determination of lease term & discount rate : 	 	 Ind AS 116 Leases requires lessee to determine  the lease term as the non-cancellable period of  a lease adjusted with any option to extend or  terminate the lease, if the use of such option  is reasonably certain. The Company makes  assessment on the expected lease term on lease  by lease basis and thereby assesses whether it  is reasonably certain that any options to extend  or terminate the contract will be exercised.  In evaluating the lease term, the Company  considers factors such as any significant  leasehold improvements undertaken over the  lease term, costs relating to the termination  of lease and the importance of the underlying  to the Company’s operations taking into  account the location of the underlying asset  and the availability of the suitable alternatives.  The lease term in future periods is reassessed to  ensure that the lease term reflects the current  economic circumstances. 	 	 The discount rate is generally based on the  incremental borrowing rate specific to the  lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases  with similar characteristics. 	 viii)	 Asset Retirement Obligation: 	 	 The liability for asset retirement obligations  are recognised when the Company has an  obligation to perform site restoration activity.  The recognition and measurement of asset  retirement obligations involves the use of   ===== PAGE 286 ===== Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED 404 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 estimates and assumptions, viz. the timing of  abandonment of site facilities which would  depend upon the ultimate life of the project,  expected utilisation of assets in other projects,  the scope of abandonment activity and pre-tax  rate applied for discounting. 	 ix)	 Recognition and measurement of Contingent  liabilities, provisions and uncertain tax positions: 	 	 There are various legal, direct and indirect tax  matters and other obligations including local  and state levies, availing input tax credits etc.,  which may impact the Company. Evaluation of  uncertain liabilities and contingent liabilities  arising out of above matters and recognition  and measurement of other provisions are based  on the assessment of the probability of an  outflow of resources, and on past experience  and circumstances known at the balance sheet  date. The actual outflow of resources at a  future date may therefore vary from the figure  included in other provisions. c)	 Current & Non-Current Classification 	 Any asset or liability is classified as current if it  satisfies any of the following conditions: 	 i)	 The asset/liability is expected to be realised/ settled in the Company’s normal operating cycle; 	 ii)	 The asset is intended for sale or consumption; 	 iii)	 The asset/liability is held primarily for the  purpose of trading; 	 iv)	 The asset/liability is expected to be realised/ settled  within  twelve  months  after  the  reporting period; 	 v)	 The asset is cash or cash equivalent unless it  is restricted from being exchanged or used to  settle a liability for at least twelve months after  the reporting date; 	 vi)	 In the case of a liability, the Company does not  have an unconditional right to defer settlement  of the liability for at least twelve months after  the reporting date. 	 All other assets and liabilities are classified as  non-current. Deferred tax assets and liabilities  are  classified  as  non-current  assets  and  liabilities respectively. 	 For  the  purpose  of  current/non-current  classification of assets and liabilities, the Company  has ascertained its normal operating cycle as twelve  months. This is based on the nature of services  and the time between the acquisition of assets or  inventories for processing and their realisation in  cash and cash equivalents. II	 Summary of Material Accounting Policies a)	 Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation 	 i)	 Functional and presentation currency 	 	 The financial statements are presented in  Indian Rupee (INR), which is entity's functional  and presentation currency. 	 ii)	 Transactions and Balances 	 	 Foreign currency transactions are translated  into  the  functional  currency,  for  initial  recognition, using the exchange rates at the  dates of the transactions. 	 	 All foreign currency denominated monetary  assets and liabilities are translated at the  exchange  rates  on  the  reporting  date.  Exchange differences arising on settlement or  translation of monetary items are recognised  in Statement of Profit and Loss except to the  extent of exchange differences which are  regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on  foreign currency borrowings that are directly  attributable to the acquisition or construction  of qualifying assets which are capitalised as  cost of assets. Non-monetary items that are  measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign  currency are not retranslated. b)	 Non Current Assets held for Sale and Discontinued  Operations 	 The Company classifies Non Current assets (or  disposal group) and operations as held for sale or  as discontinued operations if their carrying amounts  will be recovered principally through a sale rather  than through continuing use. Classification as  a discontinued operations occurs upon disposal  or when the operation meets the below criteria,  whichever is earlier.  ===== PAGE 287 ===== Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 405 Strategic Review Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 	 Non Current Assets are classified as held for sale  only when both the conditions are satisfied – 	 1. 	 The sale is highly probable, and 	 2. 	 The asset or disposal group is available for  immediate sale in its present condition subject  only to terms that are usual and customary for  sale of such assets. 	 Non-current  assets  which  are  subject  to  depreciation are not depreciated or amortised once  those classified as held for sale. 	 A discontinued operation is a component of the  Company's business, the operations of which can  be clearly distinguished from those of the rest of  the Company and 	 i)	 is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose  of a separate major line of business or  geographical area of operations; or 	 ii)	 is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a  view to resale. 	 Non-current assets and disposal groups classified  as held for sale are measured at the lower of their  carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell.  Assets and associated liabilities classified as held for  sale are presented separately in the balance sheet.  The results of discontinued operations are excluded  from the overall results of the Company and are  presented separately as a single amount in the  statement of profit and loss. Also, the comparative  statement of profit and loss is re-presented as if the  operations had been discontinued from the start of  the comparative period. c)	 Cash & Cash Equivalents 	 Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposit  with banks. Cash equivalents are short-term  balances (with an original maturity of three months  or less from the date of acquisition), that are readily  convertible into known amounts of cash and which  are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. d)	 Property, Plant and Equipment 	 Recognition and Measurement 	 Property, Plant and Equipment, including Capital  Work in Progress, are stated at cost of acquisition  or construction less accumulated depreciation and  impairment losses, if any. Borrowing cost relating  to acquisition / construction of Property, Plant and  Equipment which takes substantial period of time  to get ready for its intended use are also included to  the extent they relate to the period till such assets  are ready to be put to use. 	 The present value of the expected cost for the  decommissioning of an asset after its use is included  in the cost of the respective asset if the recognition  criteria for a provision are met. 	 If significant parts of an item of property, plant and  equipment have different useful lives, then they are  accounted for as separate items (major components)  of property, plant and equipment. 	 The Company has elected to regard previous GAAP  carrying values of property, plant and equipment  as deemed cost at the date of transition to Ind AS  i.e. April 1, 2015. 	 Subsequent Measurement 	 Subsequent expenditure related to an item of  Property, Plant and Equipment are included in its  carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset,  as appropriate, only when it is probable that the  future economic benefits associated with the item  will flow to the Company and the cost of the item  can be measured reliably. Subsequent costs are  depreciated over the residual life of the respective  assets. All other expenses on existing Property,  Plant  and  Equipment,  including  day-to-day  repair and maintenance expenditure and cost of  replacing parts, are charged to the Statement of  Profit and Loss for the period during which such  expenses are incurred. 	 Capital Work in Progress 	 Expenditure  related  to  and  incurred  during  implementation of capital projects to get the assets  ready for intended use is included under “Capital  Work in Progress”. The same is allocated to the  respective items of property plant and equipment on  completion of construction/ erection of the capital  project/ property plant and equipment. The cost of  asset not ready for its intended use before the year  end & capital inventory are disclosed under capital  work in progress.  ===== PAGE 288 ===== Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED 406 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 	 Depreciation 	 Depreciation is provided using straight-line method  as specified in Schedule II to the Companies  Act, 2013 or based on technical estimates.  Depreciation on assets added / disposed off during  the year is provided on pro-rata basis with reference  to the date of addition / disposal. 	 Derecognition 	 An item of property, plant and equipment is  derecognised upon disposal or when no future  economic benefits are expected to arise from  continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising  on the disposal or retirement of property, plant  and equipment is determined as the difference  between the sale proceeds and the carrying amount  of the assets and is recognised in Statement of  Profit and Loss. e)	 Investment Properties 	 i)	 Assets which are held for long-term rental  yields or for capital appreciation or both,  are  classified  as  Investment  Properties.  Investment properties are measured initially at  cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to  initial recognition, investment properties are  stated at cost less accumulated depreciation  and accumulated impairment loss, if any. 	 	 The Company has elected to regard previous  GAAP carrying values of investment properties  as deemed cost at the date of transition to Ind  AS i.e. April 1, 2015. 	 ii)	 The  Company  depreciates  investment  properties over their estimated useful lives, as  specified in Schedule II to the Companies  Act, 2013. 	 iii)	 Investment properties are derecognised either  when they have been disposed off or when  they are permanently withdrawn from use and  no future economic benefit is expected from  their disposal. The difference between the net  disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of  the asset is recognised in Statement of Profit  and Loss in the period in which the property  is derecognised. f)	 Intangible Assets 	 i)	 Intangible assets are measured on initial  recognition at cost and are subsequently  carried  at  cost  less  any  accumulated  amortisation and accumulated impairment  losses, if any. Internally generated intangibles  are not capitalised. 	 	 Mine Development Assets include expenses  pertaining to land and mine development,  initial overburden removal, environmental and  other regulatory approvals etc. It represents  expenses incurred towards development of  mines where the Company is operating as  operator and developer. 	 	 The Company has elected to regard previous  GAAP carrying values of intangible assets as  deemed cost at the date of transition to Ind AS  i.e. April 1, 2015. 	 ii)	 The intangible assets with finite lives are  amortised over the useful economic life and  assessed for impairment whenever there is an  indication that the intangible asset may be  impaired. The Company reviews amortisation  period on an annual basis. 	 	 Intangible assets are amortised on straight line  basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Intangible Assets Estimated Useful Life  (Years) Software  applications 3-5 Years based on  management estimate Mine Development  Assets Over a period of  underlying contract 	 iii)	 Gains or losses arising from derecognition  of an intangible asset are measured as the  difference between the net disposal proceeds  and the carrying amount of the asset and are  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss  when the asset is derecognised. 	 	 Intangible Assets under Development 	 	 Expenditure incurred during development of  intangible assets is included under “Intangible  Assets under Development”. The same is  allocated to the respective items of intangible  assets on completion of the project.  ===== PAGE 289 ===== Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 407 Strategic Review Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements g)	 Impairment of Non-Financial Assets 	 At the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews  the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible  assets to determine whether there is any indication  that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.  If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount  of the asset is estimated in order to determine the  extent of the impairment loss (if any). 	 Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing  the recoverable amount of CGU to which such  goodwill relates. 	 If the recoverable amount of an asset (or  cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less  than its carrying amount, the carrying amount  of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced  to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss  is recognised immediately in the Statement of  Profit or Loss. 	 Assets (other than goodwill) for which impairment  loss has been recognised in prior periods, the  Company reviews at each reporting date whether  there is any indication that the loss has decreased  or no longer exists. When an impairment loss  subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the  asset (or a cash-generating unit) is increased to the  revised estimate of its recoverable amount, so that  the increased carrying amount does not exceed the  carrying amount that would have been determined  had no impairment loss been recognised. A reversal  of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in  Statement of Profit and Loss. 	 Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing  the recoverable amount of CGU to which such  goodwill relates. When the recoverable amount of the  CGU is less than its carrying amount, an impairment  loss is recognised. Impairment losses relating to  goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods. h)	 Investment in Subsidiaries, Jointly Controlled  Entities, Associates and Unincorporated Entities 	 Investment  in  Subsidiaries,  Joint  Controlled  Entities and Associates are measured at cost less  impairment in accordance with Ind AS 27 ''Separate  Financial Statements''. 	 In case of unincorporated entities in the nature  of a Joint Operation, the Company recognises its  direct right and its share of jointly held or incurred  assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, revenues  and expenses of joint operations. These have been  incorporated in these financial statements under  the appropriate headings. i)	 Financial Instruments 	 A financial instrument is any contract that gives  rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial  liability or equity instrument of another entity. 	 Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially  measured at fair value, except for trade receivables  which are measured at transaction price. 	 The financial assets comprise of trade receivables,  cash and cash equivalents, other bank balances  and deposits, interest accrued, security deposits,  intercorporate  deposits,  contract  assets  and  other receivables. These assets are measured  subsequently at amortised cost. 	 The financial liabilities comprise of borrowings,  lease liabilities, retention and capital creditors,  interest accrued, deposit from customers, trade and  other payables. 	 Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset  when the Company has a legally enforceable right  (not contingent on future events) to off-set the  recognised amounts either to settle on a net basis,  or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities  simultaneously. 	 An equity instrument is any contract that evidences  a residual interest in the assets of an entity after  deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments  issued by the Company are recognised at the  proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 	 A)	 Financial Assets 	 	 Initial Recognition 	 	 All financial assets, except trade receivables,  are initially recognised at fair value. 	 	 Subsequent Measurement 	 	 Business Model Assessment 	 	 The Company makes an assessment of the  objectives of the business model in which a  financial asset is held because it best reflects  the way business is managed and information  is provided to management. The assessment  of business model comprises the stated  policies and objectives of the financial assets,   ===== PAGE 290 ===== Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED 408 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 management strategy for holding the financial  assets, the risk that affects the performance  etc.  Further  management  also  evaluates  whether the contractual cash flows are solely  payment of principal and interest considering  the contractual terms of the instrument. 	 	 The subsequent measurement of financial  assets depends on their classification, as  described below: 	 1) 	 At amortised cost 	 	 A financial asset is measured at the amortised  cost if both the following conditions are met : 	 	 (a) 	 The asset is held within a business model  whose objective is to hold assets for  collecting contractual cash flows, and 	 	 (b)	 Contractual terms of the asset give rise, on  specified dates, to cash flows that are solely  payments of principal and interest (SPPI)  on the principal amount outstanding. 	 	 After initial measurement, such financial assets  are subsequently measured at amortised cost  using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method.  Amortised cost is calculated by taking into  account any discount or premium on acquisition  and fees or costs that are an integral part of  the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in  finance income in the Statement of Profit and  Loss. The losses arising from impairment are  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.  This category generally applies to trade and  other receivables. 	 	 The effective interest rate is the rate that  exactly  discounts  estimated  future  cash  receipts (including all fees and transaction costs  and other premiums or discounts) through the  expected life of the financial assets, or where  appropriate, a shorter period, to the gross  carrying amount on initial recognition. 	 2)	 At Fair Value through Other Comprehensive  Income (FVTOCI) 	 	 A financial asset is classified as at the FVTOCI if  both of the following criteria are met: 	 	 (a)	 The objective of the business model is  achieved both by collecting contractual  cash flows and selling the financial assets,  and 	 	 (b)	 Contractual terms of the asset give rise on  specified dates to cash flows that are solely  payments of principal and interest (SPPI)  on the principal amount outstanding. 	 	 Debt  instruments  included  within  the  FVTOCI category are measured initially as  well as at each reporting date at fair value.  Fair value movements are recognised in the  Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) and on  derecognition, cumulative gain or loss previously  recognised in OCI is reclassified to Statement  of Profit and Loss. For equity instruments, the  Company may make an irrevocable election to  present subsequent changes in the fair value  in OCI. If the Company decides to classify an  equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair  value changes on the instrument, excluding  dividends, are recognised in the OCI. There is no  recycling of the amounts from OCI to Statement  of Profit and Loss, even on sale of investment. 	 3) 	 At Fair Value through Profit & Loss (FVTPL) 	 	 Financial assets which are not measured at  amortised cost or FVTOCI and are held for  trading are measured at FVTPL. 	 	 In addition, the Company may elect to designate  a debt instrument, which otherwise meets  amortised cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL.  However, such election is allowed only if doing  so reduces or eliminates a measurement or  recognition inconsistency (referred to as  ‘accounting mismatch’). 	 	 Equity investments 	 	 All equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109  are measured at fair value. The Company may  make an irrevocable election to present in other  comprehensive income subsequent changes  in the fair value. The Company makes such  election on an instrument-by-instrument basis.  The classification is made on initial recognition  and is irrevocable. 	 	 If the Company decides to classify an equity  instrument as FVTOCI, then all fair value  changes  on  the  instrument,  excluding  dividends, are recognised in the OCI. There is no  recycling of the amounts from OCI to profit and  loss, even on sale of investment. However, the   ===== PAGE 291 ===== Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 409 Strategic Review Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements Company may transfer the cumulative gain or  loss within equity. 	 	 Equity instruments included within the FVTPL  category are measured at fair value with all  changes recognised in the profit and loss. 	 	 Derecognition 	 	 On derecognition of a financial asset, the  difference between the asset’s carrying amount  and the sum of the consideration received and  receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that  had been recognised in other comprehensive  income and accumulated in equity is recognised  in Statement of Profit and Loss if such gain or  loss would have otherwise been recognised in  Statement of Profit and Loss on disposal of that  financial asset. 	 	 Impairment of financial assets 	 	 The Company applies Expected Credit Loss  (ECL) model for measurement and recognition  of impairment loss on the financial assets and  credit risk exposure. The Company assesses  on a forward looking basis the expected credit  losses associated with its receivables based on  historical trends and past experience. 	 	 The Company follows 'Simplified Approach’ for  recognition of impairment loss allowance on all  trade receivables or contractual receivables. 	 	 ECL is the difference between all contracted  cash flows that are due to the Company in  accordance with the contract and all the cash  flows that the Company expects to receive,  discounted at the original EIR. ECL impairment  loss allowance (or reversal) recognised during  the period is recognised as income / (expense)  in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 	 B)	 Financial Liabilities 	 	 Financial liabilities are classified, at initial  recognition as at amortised cost or fair value  through profit or loss. The measurement  of  financial  liabilities  depends  on  their  classification, as described below: 	 1) 	 At amortised cost 	 	 This is the category most relevant to the  Company. After initial recognition, financial  liabilities  are  subsequently  measured  at  amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and  losses are recognised in Statement of Profit  and Loss when the liabilities are derecognised  as well as through the EIR amortisation process.  Amortised cost is calculated by taking into  account any discount or premium on acquisition  and fees or costs that are an integral part of the  EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance  costs in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 	 	 The effective interest method is a method of  calculating the amortised cost of a financial  liability and of allocating interest expense over  the relevant period. The effective interest rate  is the rate that exactly discounts estimated  future cash payments (including all fees and  points paid or received that form an integral  part of the effective interest rate, transaction  costs and other premiums or discounts) through  the expected life of the financial liability, or  (where appropriate) a shorter period, to the net  carrying amount on initial recognition. 	 2) 	 At fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) 	 	 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit  or loss include financial liabilities held for  trading and financial liabilities designated  upon initial recognition as such. Subsequently,  any changes in fair value are recognised in the  Statement of Profit and Loss. 	 	 Derecognition of Financial Liability 	 	 A financial liability is derecognised when the  obligation under the liability is discharged  or  cancelled  or  expires.  An  exchange  with a lender of debt instruments with  substantially different terms is accounted for  as an extinguishment of the original financial  liability and the recognition of a new financial  liability. Similarly, a substantial modification  of the terms of an existing financial liability  is accounted for as an extinguishment of the  original financial liability and the recognition of  a new financial liability. 	 C)	 Derivative financial instruments 	 	 Initial recognition and subsequent  measurement 	 	 The  Company  uses  derivative  financial  instruments such as forward and options   ===== PAGE 292 ===== Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED 410 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency  risks. Such derivative financial instruments are  initially recognised and subsequently measured  at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).  Derivatives are carried as financial assets  when the fair value is positive and as financial  liabilities when the fair value is negative. 	 	 Any gains or losses arising from changes in the  fair value of derivative financial instrument  are recognised in the Statement of Profit and  Loss and reported with foreign exchange gains/ (loss). Changes in fair value and gains/(losses)  on settlement of foreign currency derivative  financial instruments relating to borrowings,  which have not been designated as hedge are  recorded as finance cost. j)	 Income Taxes 	 Income tax expense comprises current tax expense  and the net change in the deferred tax asset or  liability during the year. Current and deferred taxes  are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss,  except when they relate to items that are recognised  in other comprehensive income or directly in equity,  in which case, the current and deferred tax are  also recognised in other comprehensive income or  directly in equity, respectively. i)	 Current Tax 	 Current income tax assets and liabilities are  measured  at  the  amount  expected  to  be  recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.  Current income tax(including Minimum Alternate  Tax (MAT)) is measured at the amount expected to  be paid to the tax authorities in accordance with  the Income-Tax Act, 1961 enacted in India. The tax  rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are  those that are enacted or substantially enacted, at  the reporting date. 	 Current income tax relating to items recognised  outside the statement of profit and loss is  recognised outside the statement of profit and  loss (either in other comprehensive income (OCI)  or in equity). Management periodically evaluates  positions taken in the tax returns with respect to  situations in which applicable tax regulations are  subject to interpretation and establishes provisions  where appropriate. ii)	 Deferred Tax 	 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised  for deductible and taxable temporary differences  arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities  and their carrying amount, except when the deferred  tax arises from the initial recognition of an asset  or liability in a transaction that is not a business  combination and affects neither accounting nor  taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction. 	 Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent  that it is probable that taxable profit will be available  against which the deductible temporary differences,  and the carry forward of unused tax credits and  unused tax losses can be utilised. 	 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured  at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the  year when the asset is realised or the liability is  settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that  have been enacted or substantively enacted at the  reporting date. 	 Deferred tax includes MAT tax credit. The Company  recognises tax credits in the nature of MAT credit as  an asset only to the extent that there is convincing  evidence that the Company will pay normal income  tax during the specified period, i.e., the period for  which tax credit is allowed to be carried forward.  In the year in which the Company recognises tax  credits as an asset, the said asset is created by way  of tax credit to the statement of profit and loss.  The Company reviews such tax credit asset at each  reporting date to assess its recoverability. k)	 Inventories 	 i)	 Inventories are valued at lower of cost or net  realisable value. 	 ii)	 Cost of inventories have been computed to  include all costs of purchases, cost of conversion,  all non-refundable duties & taxes and other  costs incurred in bringing the inventories to  their present location and condition. 	 iii)	 The basis of determining cost for various  categories of inventories are as follows: 	 	 Traded goods		 	 Weighted Average Cost 	 	 Stores and Spares		 Weighted Average Cost  ===== PAGE 293 ===== Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 411 Strategic Review Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 	 iv)	 Net realisable value is the estimated selling  price in the ordinary course of business,  less  estimated  cost  of  completion  and  estimated cost necessary to make the sale.  Necessary adjustment for shortage / excess  stock is given based on the available evidence  and past experience of the Company. l)	 Provision, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent  Assets 	 Provisions are recognised for when the Company has  at present, legal or contractual obligation as a result  of past events, only if it is probable that an outflow  of resources embodying economic outgo or loss  will be required and if the amount involved can be  measured reliably. If the effect of the time value of  money is material, provisions are discounted using a  current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate,  the risks specific to the liability. When discounting  is used, the increase in the provision due to the  passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.  The Company recognises provision for asset  retirement obligation in accordance with the mining  services contract. 	 Contingent liabilities being a possible obligation  as a result of past events, the existence of which  will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non  occurrence of one or more future events not wholly  in control of the Company are not recognised in  the accounts. The nature of such liabilities and an  estimate of its financial effect are disclosed in notes  to the financial statements. 	 Contingent assets are not recognised in the  financial statements. The nature of such assets and  an estimate of its financial effect are disclosed in  notes to the financial statements. m)	 Revenue Recognition 	 Revenue from contract with customer is recognised  upon transfer of control of promised products or  services to customers on complete satisfaction of  performance obligations for an amount that reflects  the consideration which the Company expects to  receive in exchange for those products or services.  Revenue is measured based on the transaction price,  which is the consideration, adjusted for discounts  and other incentives, if any, as per contracts with the  customers. Revenue also excludes taxes or amounts  collected from customers in its capacity as agent. 	 The specific recognition criteria from various stream  of revenue is described below: 	 (i)	 Sale of Goods 	 	 Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when  the Company transfers control of the goods,  generally on delivery, or when the goods have  been dispatched to the customer's specified  location as per the terms of contract, provided  the company has not retained any significant  risk of ownership or future obligation with  respect to the goods dispatched. 	 (ii)	 Rendering of Services 	 	 Revenue from services rendered is recognised  when the work is performed and as per the  terms of agreement. 	 (iii)	 Dividends 	 	 Revenue is recognised when the Company’s  right to receive the payment is established,  which  is  generally  when  shareholders  approve the dividend. 	 (iv)	 Interest Income 	 	 Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by  reference to the principal outstanding and at  the effective interest rate applicable, which  is the rate that exactly discounts estimated  future cash receipts through the expected  life of the financial asset to that asset's net  carrying amount on initial recognition. 	 	 Contract Assets 	 	 A contract asset is the right to consideration  in exchange for goods or services transferred  to the customer. If the Company performs by  transferring goods or services to a customer  before the customer pays consideration or  before payment is due, a contract asset is  recognised for the earned consideration that is  conditional. The same is disclosed under Other  Current Financial Assets. 	 	 Trade Receivable 	 	 A receivable represents the Company's right to  an amount of consideration that is unconditional  i.e. only the passage of time is required before  payment of consideration is due.  ===== PAGE 294 ===== Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED 412 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 	 	 Contract Liability 	 	 A contract liability is the obligation to transfer  goods or services to a customer for which  the Company has received consideration (or  an amount of consideration is due) from the  customer. Contract liabilities are recognised as  revenue when the Company performs under the  contract. The same is disclosed under Other  Current Liabilities. n)	 Employee Benefits 	 Employee benefits includes gratuity, compensated  absences, contribution to provident fund, employees'  state insurance and superannuation fund. 	 i)	 Short Term Employee Benefits 	 	 Employee benefits payable wholly within twelve  months of rendering the services are classified  as short term employee benefits and recognised  in the period in which the employee renders  the related service. These are recognised at the  undiscounted amount of the benefits expected  to be paid in exchange for that service. 	 ii)	 Post Employment Benefits 	 	 Defined Contribution Plans 	 	 Retirement benefits in the form of provident  fund and superannuation fund are defined  contribution schemes. The Company has no  obligation, other than the contribution payable  to the provident fund. The Company recognises  contribution payable to the these funds as  an expense, when an employee renders the  related service. If the contribution payable to  the scheme for service received before the  balance sheet date exceeds the contribution  already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme  is recognised as a liability after deducting the  contribution already paid. 	 	 Defined Benefit Plans 	 	 The Company operates a defined benefit  gratuity plan in India, in which contributions  are maintained to a separately administered  fund. The cost of providing benefits under  the defined benefit plan is determined based  on actuarial valuation, carried out by an  independent actuary, using the projected  unit credit method. The liability for gratuity is  funded annually to a gratuity funds maintained  with the Life Insurance Corporation of India  and SBI Life Insurance Company Limited. 	 	 Re-measurements gains and losses arising  from experience adjustments, changes in  actuarial assumptions and the return on plan  assets (excluding net interest) are recognised  immediately in the balance sheet with a  corresponding debit or credit to retained  earnings  through  other  comprehensive  income in the period in which they occur.  Re-measurements are not reclassified to profit  or loss in subsequent periods. Net interest is  calculated by applying the discount rate to the  net balance of defined benefit liability or asset. 	 	 The Company recognises the following changes  in the net defined benefit obligation as an  expense in the statement of profit and loss in  the line item ''Employee Benefits Expense'': 	  	 -	 Service cost including current service  cost,  past  service  cost,  gains  and  losses on curtailments and non-routine  settlements; and 	 	  -	 Net interest expense or income. 	 iii)	 Other Employee Benefits 	 	 Other  employee  benefits  comprise  of  compensated absences / leaves.

Remeasurements as a result of  experience  adjustments  and  changes  in  actuarial assumptions are recognised in the  Statement of Profit and Loss. 	 iv)	 For the purpose of presentation of defined  benefit plans and other long term benefits,  the  allocation  between  current  and  non-current provisions has been made as  determined by an actuary. o)	 Borrowing Costs 	 Borrowing costs directly attributable to the  acquisition, construction or production of a  qualifying asset that necessarily takes a substantial  period of time to get ready for its intended use or  sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.  Borrowing costs consist of interest and transaction  costs that an entity incurs in connection with the   ===== PAGE 295 ===== Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 413 Strategic Review Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements borrowing of funds. Transaction costs in respect of  long-term borrowings are amortised over the tenor  of respective loans using effective interest method.  All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period  in which they are incurred. Borrowing costs also  includes exchange differences arising from foreign  currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded  as an adjustment to the borrowing costs. p)	 Leases 	 The Company assesses whether a contract contains  a lease, at the inception of the contract. A contract  is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the  right to control the use of an identified asset for a  period of time in exchange for consideration. 	 Company as a lessee 	 The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and  a lease liability at the lease commencement date.  The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost,  which comprises the initial amount of the lease  liability adjusted for any lease payments made at  or before the commencement date, plus any initial  direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to  dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to  restore the site on which it is located, less any lease  incentives received. 	 Certain lease arrangements include the option to  extend or terminate the lease before the end of  the lease term. The right-of-use assets and lease  liabilities include these options when it is reasonably  certain that the option will be exercised. 	 The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated  using  the  straight-line  method  from  the  commencement date to the earlier of the end of  the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end  of the lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset  is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any,  and adjusted for certain re-measurements of the  lease liability. 	 The lease liability is initially measured at the present  value of the lease payments that are not paid at the  commencement date, discounted using the interest  rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be  readily determined, the Company’s incremental  borrowing rate. Generally, the Company uses its  incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. 	 The lease liability is subsequently measured at  amortised cost using the effective interest method.  It is remeasured when there is a change in future  lease payments arising from a change in an index or  rate, if there is a change in the Company’s estimate  of the amount expected to be payable under a  residual value guarantee, or if there is a change in  the lease payments or a change in the assessment  of an option to purchase the underlying asset. 	 For a lease modification that is not a separate lease,  at the effective date of the modification, the lessee  accounts for the lease modification by remeasuring  the lease liability using a discount rate determined  at that date and the lessee makes a corresponding  adjustment to the right-of-use asset. 	 When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a  corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying  amount of the right-of-use asset or is recorded in  profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of- use asset has been reduced to zero. 	 Lease payments have been classified as financing  activities in Statement of Cash Flow. 	 The Company has elected not to recognise right-of- use assets and lease liabilities for short term leases  that have a lease term of less than or equal to 12  months with no purchase option and assets with  low value leases. The Company recognises the  lease payments associated with these leases as an  expense in statement of profit and loss over the  lease term. The related cash flows are classified as  operating activities. 	 Company as a lessor 	 Leases in which the Company does not transfer  substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership  of an asset are classified as operating leases.  Rental income from operating lease is recognised  on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant  lease. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in  the period in which they are earned. 	 Leases are classified as finance leases when  substantially all of the risks and rewards of  ownership transfer from the Company to the lessee.  Amounts due from lessees under finance leases  are recorded as receivables at the Companies net  investment in the leases. Finance lease income   ===== PAGE 296 ===== Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED 414 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect  a constant periodic rate of return on the net  investment outstanding in respect of the lease. q)	 Earnings Per Share 	 Basic EPS is computed by dividing the profit or  loss attributable to the owners of the Company  by the weighted average number of equity shares  outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is computed  by dividing the profit or loss attributable to the  owners of the Company (after adjusting for costs  associated with dilutive potential equity shares)  by the weighted average number of equity shares  and dilutive potential equity shares outstanding  during the year. r)	 Service Work in Progress 	 Service Work in Progress is valued at lower of cost  and net realisable value. Cost is determined based  on Weighted Average Cost Method. 	 Service Work in Progress represents closing  inventory of Washed Coal, which is not owned by the  Company as per the terms of Mine Development and  Operation (MDO) contract. Hence, this represents  work performed under contractual liability in bringing  this inventory to its present condition and location. 	 Net realisable value is the contract price as per the  MDO Agreement, less estimated costs of completion  and estimated costs necessary to make the sale. s)	 Overburden Cost Adjustment 	 Overburden removal expenses incurred during  production stage are charged to revenue based on  waste-to-ore ratio, (commonly known as Stripping  Ratio in the industry). This ratio is taken based on  the current operational phase of overall mining  area. To the extent the current period ratio exceeds  the expected Stripping Ratio of a phase, excess  overburden costs are deferred. t)	 Expenditure 	 Expenses are net of taxes recoverable, where  applicable.  ===== PAGE 297 ===== 415 Strategic Review Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 3.

Fair Value Hierarchy : The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are  either observable or unobservable and consists of the following three levels: Level-1 : Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level-2 : Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level-1 that are observable for the asset or liability,  either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Level-3 : Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in  whole or in part using a valuation model based on the assumptions that are neither supported by prices from  observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data. The following tables summarise carrying amounts of financial instruments by their categories and their levels in  fair value hierarchy for each year end presented.

Financial Instruments and Risk Review (Contd.)  ===== PAGE 331 ===== Notes forming part of the Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 449 Strategic Review Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements (b)	 Financial Risk Management Objective and Policies : The Company's risk management activities are subject to the management direction and control under the  framework of Risk Management Policy as approved by the Board of Directors of the Company. The Management  ensures appropriate risk governance framework for the Company through appropriate policies and procedures and  that risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with the Company's policies and risk objectives. The Company is primarily exposed to risks resulting from fluctuation in market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk,  which may adversely impact the fair value of its financial instruments. 	 (i)	 Market Risk 	 Market risk is the risk that future earnings and fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument may  fluctuate because of changes in market price. Market risk comprises of commodity price risk, currency risk  and interest risk. 	 A.	 Commodity Price Risk : 	 The Company's performance is affected by the price volatility of commodities being traded (primarily coal  and also other materials) which are being sourced mainly from international markets. As the Company is  engaged in the on-going purchase or continuous sale of traded goods, it keeps close monitoring over its  purchases to optimise the price. Commodity prices are affected by demand and supply scenario in the  international market, currency exchange fluctuations and taxes levied in various countries. To mitigate  price risk, the Company effectively manages availability of coal as well as price volatility through widening  its sourcing base, appropriate combination of long term and short term contracts with its vendors and  customers and well planned procurement and inventory strategy. 	 B.	 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk : 	 Since the Company operates internationally and portion of the business transacted are carried out in more  than one currency, it is exposed to currency risks through its transactions in foreign currency or where  assets or liabilities are denominated in currency other than functional currency. 	 The Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from foreign currency transactions and follows  established risk management policies including the use of derivatives like foreign exchange forward and  option contracts to hedge exposure to foreign currency risks. 	 For open positions on outstanding foreign currency contracts and details on unhedged foreign currency  exposure, please refer note no. 44. 	 For every percentage point depreciation / appreciation in the exchange rate between the functional currency  and foreign currency, the Company's profit before tax for the year would increase or decrease as follows: (` In crore) Particulars For the year ended  March 31, 2024 For the year ended  March 31, 2023 Impact on profit before tax for the year 0.26 11.41 	 C. 	 Interest Risk : The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates due to its financing, investing and cash management  activities. The risks arising from interest rate movements arise from borrowings with variable interest rates.  The Company manages its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of fixed and variable rate loans  and borrowings. 43.

The Group’s Central Treasury Team ensures appropriate financial risk governance framework for the Company  through appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed  in accordance with the Group’s policies and risk objectives. For Company's floating rate borrowings, the analysis is prepared assuming that the amount of the liability  outstanding at the end of the reporting period was outstanding for the whole year. A 50 basis point increase  or decrease is used, which represents management's assessment of the reasonably possible change  in interest rate.

Financial instruments that are subject to credit risk principally consist  of Loans, Trade and Other Receivables, Cash & Cash Equivalents, Investments and Other Financial Assets.  The carrying amounts of financial assets represent the maximum credit risk exposure. Credit risk encompasses both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness as well  as concentration of risks. Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness of counter  parties on continuous basis with appropriate approval mechanism for sanction of credit limits. Credit risk  from balances with banks, financial institutions and investments is managed by the Company's treasury team  in accordance with the Company's risk management policy. Cash and cash equivalents and Bank Deposits  are placed with banks having good reputation, good past track record and high quality credit rating. The concentration of credit risk is very limited due to the fact that the large customers are mainly public sector  units (which are government undertakings) and hence may not entail any credit risk. Remaining customer  base is large and widely dispersed.

The Company's objective is to provide financial resources to meet  its obligations when they are due in a timely, cost effective and reliable manner and to manage its capital  structure.

The use of derivative instruments is subject to  limits, authorities and regular monitoring by appropriate levels of management. The limits, authorities and  monitoring systems are periodically reviewed by management and the Board. The market risk on derivatives  is mitigated by changes in the valuation of the underlying assets, liabilities or transactions, as derivatives are  used only for risk management purposes.

In this regard, certain  writ petitions were filed with the Hon'ble Supreme Court (''SC'') seeking independent investigation of the  allegations in SSR. During the proceedings, SC observed that the Securities and Exchange Board of India  (''SEBI'') was investigating the matter. The SC also constituted an Expert Committee to investigate as well as  suggest measures to strengthen existing laws and regulations and also directed the SEBI to consider certain  additional aspects in its scope. The Expert Committee submitted its report dated May 6, 2023, finding no  regulatory failure in respect of applicable laws and regulations. The SEBI also concluded its investigations  in twenty-two of the twenty-four matters as per the status report dated August 25, 2023 to the SC. 	 On January 3, 2024, the SC disposed off all matters in various petitions including those relating to separate  independent investigations relating to the allegations in the SSR. Further, the SC directed SEBI to complete  the pending two investigations, preferably within three months, and take its investigations (including 22  already completed) to their logical conclusion in accordance with law. During the year ended March 31,  2024, the Company has received two show cause notices (SCNs) from the SEBI alleging non-compliance of  provisions of the Listing Agreement and LODR Regulations pertaining to related party transactions in respect  of certain transactions with third parties and validity of peer review certificates of statutory auditors with  respect to earlier years. The management believes that there is no material consequential effect of above  SCNs to relevant financial statements and no material non-compliance of applicable laws and regulations. 	 Earlier in April 2023, the Company had undertaken review of transactions referred in SSR through  an independent assessment by a law firm, which confirmed that (a) none of the alleged related parties  mentioned in the SSR were related parties to the Company or its subsidiaries, under applicable frameworks;  and (b) the Company is in compliance with the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. 	 Based on above independent assessment, the SC order and the fact that there are no pending regulatory  or adjudicatory proceedings as of date, except as mentioned above, the management concludes that that  there is no material non-compliance of applicable laws and regulations and accordingly, these financial  statements do not carry any adjustments in this regard. 45.

(c)	 Contributions to Defined Benefit Plan are as under : 	 	 The status of gratuity plan as required under Ind AS-19 : 	 	 The Company operates a defined benefit plan (the Gratuity plan) covering eligible employees, which provides  a lump sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death, incapacitation or termination of employment,  of an amount based on the respective employee's salary and the tenure of employment. 	 	 The Company has a defined benefit gratuity plan (funded) and is governed by the Payment of Gratuity Act,  1972. Under the Act, every employee who has completed at least five year of service is entitled to gratuity  benefits on departure at 15 days of basic salary (last drawn basic salary) for each completed year of service.  The scheme is funded with contributions to insurers (LIC and SBI) in form of a qualifying insurance policy. 	 	 Aforesaid post-employment benefit plans typically expose the Company to actuarial risks such as: investment  risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and salary risk Investment Risk: These Plans invest in long term debt instruments such as Government securities and  highly rated corporate bonds. The valuation of which is inversely proportionate to  the interest rate movements. There is risk of volatility in asset values due to market  fluctuations and impairment of assets due to credit losses. Interest Risk: The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated using a discount rate  which is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on  Government securities. A decrease in yields will increase the fund liabilities and vice- versa. Longevity Risk: The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated by reference to the best  estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment.  An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan's  liability. Salary Risk: The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated by reference to the future  salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in salary of the plan participants will  increase the plan's liability. 	 	 The following tables summarise the component of the net benefits expense recognised in the statement  of profit and loss account and the funded status and amounts recognised in the balance sheet for the  respective plan.

The insurance  Company, as part of the policy rules, makes payment of all gratuity outgoes happening during the year  (subject to sufficiency of funds under the policy). Any deficit in the policy assets is funded by the Company.  The policy helps mitigate the liquidity risk. However, being a cash accumulation plan, the duration of assets  is shorter compared to the duration of liabilities. Thus, the Company is exposed to movement in interest  rate (in particular, the significant fall in interest rates, which should result in a increase in liability without  corresponding increase in the asset). 	 (7)	 The Company's expected contribution to the fund in the next financial year is ` 22.27 crore (March 31, 2023  : ` 17.03 crore) 	 (8)	 The estimate of future salary increase, considered in actuarial variation, take account of inflation, seniority,  promotion and other relevant factors, such as supply and demand in the employment market. 	 	 * As the gratuity fund is managed by life insurance companies, details of fund invested by insurer are not  available with the Company. 49.	Disclosure of transactions with Related Parties, as required by Ind AS 24 “Related Party Disclosures” has been  set out below.

In our opinion and to the best of our information and  according to the explanations given to us, and based  on the consideration of the reports of other auditors on  separate audited financial statements of the subsidiaries,  jointly controlled entities and associates, referred to in  the Other Matter section below except for the possible  effects of the matters described in the ‘Basis for Qualified  Opinion’ section of our report, the aforesaid Consolidated  Financial Statements give the information required  by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in the manner  so required and give a true and fair view in conformity  with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under  section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian  Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended, (“Ind  AS”) and other accounting principles generally accepted  in India, of the Consolidated state of affairs of the  Group as at March 31, 2024, the Consolidated profit and  other comprehensive income, Consolidated changes  in equity and its Consolidated cash flows for the year  ended on that date. Basis for Qualified Opinion As described in Note 50(m) to the accompanying  Consolidated Financial Statements, on account of  pending adjudications / outcome of the investigations  by the Securities and Exchange Board of India and  based on our review of related documents, we are  unable to comment on the possible adjustments and / or disclosures, if any, that may be required to be made  in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements  in respect of this matter. We will continue to evaluate  the impact of this matter on our opinion based on any  changes in circumstances or additional information that  may become available. Further, as detailed in Note 48(f) and 48(g) of the  Consolidated Financial Statements, in case of one  of the subsidiaries, namely Mumbai International  Airport Limited (‘MIAL’), the legal proceedings involving  investigations initiated by the Ministry of Corporate  Affairs (‘MCA’) and chargesheet filed by the Central  Bureau of Investigation are currently on-going in respect  of matters involving potential conflict of interest  and alleged misuse of funds of MIAL aggregating to  ` 845.76 crores related to works contracts that are  currently included in Property, Plant and Equipment  at a net book value of ` 539.50 crores. The auditors of  MIAL have given a qualified opinion in the absence of  sufficient appropriate audit evidence in respect of the  above. Similar qualifications are inserted by the auditors  of immediate holding entities of MIAL. Our audit report for the previous year ended 31 March,  2023 was also qualified in respect of these matters. We conducted our audit of the Consolidated Financial  Statements in accordance with the Standards on  Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act  (SAs). Our responsibilities under those Standards are  further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the  Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section  of our report. We are independent of the company  in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the  Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together  with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our  audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements under  the provisions of the Act and the Rules made there under,  and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities  in accordance with these requirements and the Code  of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have  obtained along with the consideration of reports of  the other auditors referred to in Other Matters section  below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis  for our qualified audit opinion on the Consolidated  Financial Statements. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our  professional judgment, were of most significance in our  audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the   ===== PAGE 370 ===== ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED 488 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 current year. These matters were addressed in the context  of our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements as  a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do  not provide a separate opinion on these matters. In addition to the matter described in the Basis for  Qualified Opinion section we have determined the  matters described below to be the key audit matters to  be communicated in our report. Sr.  No. Key Audit Matters Auditor’s Response 1 Contingencies relating to taxation, litigations and  arbitrations The provisions and contingent liabilities relate to  ongoing litigations and claims with various authorities  and third parties. These relate to direct tax, indirect  tax, claims and other general legal proceedings  arising in the ordinary course of business. As at the  year ended 31 March 2024, the amounts involved  were significant. The assessment of a provision or a  contingent liability requires significant judgement by  the management because of the inherent complexity  in estimating future costs. The amount recognized as  a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure.  The provisions and contingent liabilities are subject to  changes in the outcomes of litigations and claims and  the positions taken by the management. It involves  significant judgement and estimation to determine  the likelihood and timing of the cash outflows and  interpretations of the legal aspects, tax legislations  and judgements previously made by authorities. Assessment of provisions arising from ongoing tax  litigations is also determined as a Key Audit Matter in  one of the components, namely New Delhi Television  Limited. Arbitration with respect to Monthly Annual Fees to  Airport Authority of India (AAI) and uncertainties  relating to the future outcome of the litigation is  also determined as a Key Audit Matter in one of the  components, namely Mumbai International Airport  Limited Principal Audit Procedures We have obtained an understanding of the process  followed by the management for assessment and  determination of the amounts of provisions and  contingent liabilities relating to taxation, litigations  and arbitrations. We have made inquiries about the status in respect  of significant provisions and contingent liabilities  with the Group’s internal tax and legal team, including  challenging the assumptions and critical judgements  made by the Group which impacted the computation  of the provisions and inspecting the computation. We assessed management’s conclusions through  discussions held with their in-house legal counsel  and understanding precedents in similar cases.  We communicated with the group’s external legal  counsel on the certain material litigations to establish  likelihood of outflow of economic resources being  probable, possible or remote in respect of the  litigations. We have involved subject matter experts with  specialized skills and knowledge to assist in the  assessment of the value of significant provisions  and contingent liabilities relating to the pending  litigations, on sample basis, in light of the nature of  the exposures, applicable regulations and related  correspondence with the authorities. We also assessed and validated the adequacy  and appropriateness of the disclosures made by  the management in the Consolidated Financial  Statements.  ===== PAGE 371 ===== 489 Strategic Review Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements Sr.  No. Key Audit Matters Auditor’s Response 2 Timing of Revenue recognition and adjustments for  coal quality variances involving critical estimates Material estimation is involved in recognition and  measurement of its revenue. The value and timing  of revenue recognition for sale of goods varies from  contract to contract, and the activity can span  beyond the year end. Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when  control is transferred to the customers and when  there are no other unfulfilled obligations. This  requires detailed analysis of each sale agreement/  contract /customer purchase order regarding timing  of revenue recognition. Inappropriate assessment could lead to a risk of  revenue being recognized on sale of goods before the  control in the goods is transferred to the customer. Subsequent adjustments are made to the transaction  price due to grade mismatch/slippage of the  transferred goods (coal). The variation in the contract  price if not settled mutually between the parties to  the contract is referred to third party testing and  the Parent estimates the adjustments required for  revenue recognition pending settlement of such  dispute. Such adjustments in revenue are made on  estimated basis following historical trend. Inappropriate estimation could lead to a risk of revenue  being overvalued or undervalued. Accordingly, timing  of recognition of revenue and adjustments for coal  quality variances involving critical estimates is a key  audit matter. Revenue Recognition is also determined as a Key  Audit Matter in one of the jointly controlled entity,  namely Adani Wilmar Limited. Principal Audit Procedures We have assessed the accounting policies for revenue  recognition in accordance with the applicable  accounting standards i.e Ind AS 115; We have conducted testing of design, implementation  and operating effectiveness of key internal financial  controls over timing of recognition of revenue from  sale of goods and subsequent adjustments made to  the transaction price; We have also performed substantive audit procedures  on selected statistical samples of customer contracts.  Verified terms and condition related to acceptance  of goods, acknowledgement on delivery receipts and  tested the transit time to deliver the goods and its  revenue recognition. Our tests of details focused on  period end samples to verify only revenue pertaining  to current year is recognized based on terms and  conditions set out in sale agreements/ contracts  and delivery documents. We have assessed the  appropriateness of the estimated adjustments in the  process. We also performed tests to establish the basis  of estimation of the consideration and whether such  estimates are commensurate with the accounting  policy. We have reviewed the calculations and adequacy of  the provision for coal quality variances. We verified  the methodology used for estimating the provision  and assess the reasonable of assumption. We have assessed the adequacy of disclosure in the  Consolidated Financial Statements.  ===== PAGE 372 ===== ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED 490 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 Sr.  No. Key Audit Matters Auditor’s Response 3 Measurement of inventory quantities of coal As at March 31, 2024 the Parent has coal inventory  of ` 2,933.99 Crores. This was determined a key  audit matter, as the measurement of these inventory  quantities lying at the ports/ yards involves significant  judgement and estimate resulting from measuring the  surface area.

As at March 31, 2024, the Parent Company  has presented the operations under Power Trading  business as “Discontinued Operations” and its related  assets as “Assets held for sale” and liabilities as  “Liabilities associated with the assets held for sale” in  accordance with Ind AS 105 (Non-current Assets held  for Sale and Discontinued Operations). Accounting  for discontinued operations requires judgment to  identify and separate the relevant financial effects  from  continuing  and  discontinued  operations.

In connection with our audit of the Consolidated  Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read  the other information, compare with the financial  statement of the subsidiaries, associates and jointly  controlled entities audited by the other auditors, to  the extent it relates to these entities and, in doing so,  consider whether the other information is materially  inconsistent with the Consolidated Financial Statements  or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise  appears to be materially misstated. Other information  so far as it relates to the subsidiaries, associates and  jointly controlled entities, is traced from its financial  statements audited by the other auditors or certified by  the management, as the case may be. If, based on the  work we have performed, we conclude that there is a  material misstatement of this other information; we are  required to report that fact. We have nothing to report  in this regard. Management’s  and  Board  of  Director’s  Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial  Statements The Parent Company’s management and the Board  of Directors are responsible for the matters stated in  Section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)  with respect to the preparation and presentation of  these Consolidated Financial Statements that give  a true and fair view of the consolidated financial  position, consolidated financial performance including  other comprehensive income, consolidated cash flows  and consolidated changes in equity of the Group, its  associates and jointly controlled entities in accordance  with the accounting principles generally accepted  in India, including the applicable Indian Accounting  Standards (Ind AS) prescribed under Section 133 of  the Act, read with the Companies (Indian Accounting  Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. The  respective  management  and  the  Board  of  Directors of the companies included in the Group  and its associates and jointly controlled entities are  responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting  records in accordance with the provisions of the Act  for safeguarding the assets of the Group, its associates  and jointly controlled entities and for preventing and  detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and  application of appropriate accounting policies; making  judgments and estimates that are reasonable and  prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance  of adequate internal financial controls, that were  operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and  completeness of the accounting records, relevant to  the preparation and presentation of the Consolidated  Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and  are free from material misstatement, whether due to  fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of  preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements by  the Board of Directors of the Parent, as aforesaid. In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the  respective management and the Boards of Directors of  the companies included in the Group its associates and  jointly controlled entities are responsible for assessing  the ability of the respective entities to continue as a  going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related  to going concern and using the going concern basis  of accounting unless respective management either  intends to liquidate or to cease operations, or has no  realistic alternative but to do so. The respective Boards of Directors of the companies  included in the Group, its associates and jointly controlled  entities are also responsible for overseeing the financial  reporting process of the Group its associates and jointly  controlled entities. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the  Consolidated Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether the Consolidated Financial Statements as a  whole are free from material misstatement, whether due  to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that  includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high  level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit  conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect  a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements  can arise from fraud or error and are considered material  if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably  be expected to influence the economic decisions  of users taken on the basis of these Consolidated  Financial Statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise  professional  judgment  and  maintain  professional  skepticism throughout the audit. We also: 	 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement  of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether  due to fraud or error, design and perform audit  procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain  audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate  to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not  detecting a material misstatement resulting from  fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,  as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional  omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of  internal control.  ===== PAGE 374 ===== ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED 492 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 	 Obtain an understanding of internal financial  controls relevant to the audit in order to design  audit procedures that are appropriate in the  circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the  Act, we are also responsible for expressing our  opinion on whether the Group, its associates and  its jointly controlled entities has adequate internal  financial controls system in place and the operating  effectiveness of such controls. 	 Evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies used and the reasonableness of accounting  estimates  and  related  disclosures  made  by  management and the Board of Directors. 	 Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s  use of the going concern basis of accounting and,  based on the audit evidence obtained, whether  a material uncertainty exists related to events or  conditions that may cast significant doubt on the  ability of the Group, its associates and its jointly  controlled entities to continue as a going concern.  If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists,  we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s  report to the related disclosures in the Consolidated  Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are  inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions  are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the  date of our auditor’s report. However, future events  or conditions may cause the Group its associates and  its jointly controlled entities to cease to continue as  a going concern. 	 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and  content of the Consolidated Financial Statements,  including  the  disclosures,  and  whether  the  Consolidated Financial Statements represent the  underlying transactions and events in a manner that  achieves fair presentation. 	 Obtain  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding the financial information of the entities  or business activities within the Group, its  associates and its jointly controlled entities to  express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial  Statements. We are responsible for the direction,  supervision and performance of the audit of the  financial statements of such entities included in  the Consolidated Financial Statements of which we  are the independent auditors. For the other entities  included in the Consolidated Financial Statements,  which have been audited by other auditors, such  other auditors remain responsible for the directions,  supervision and performance of the audits carried  out by them. We remain solely responsible for our  audit opinion. Our responsibilities in this regard are  further described in the section titled Other Matters  in this audit report. We communicate with those charged with governance  of the Parent Company and such other entities included  in the Consolidated Financial Statements of which we  are the independent auditors regarding, among other  matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit  and significant audit findings, including any significant  deficiencies in internal control that we identify  during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with  a statement that we have complied with relevant  ethical requirements regarding independence, and to  communicate with them all relationships and other  matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our  independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged  with governance, we determine those matters that were  of most significance in the audit of the Consolidated  Financial Statements of the current period and are  therefore the key audit matters. We describe these  matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation  precludes public disclosure about the matter or when,  in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that  a matter should not be communicated in our report  because the adverse consequences of doing so would  reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest  benefits of such communication.

Management’s  and  Board  of  Director’s  Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls The respective Board of Directors or management of  the Parent company, subsidiaries, associates and jointly  controlled entities, which are companies incorporated in  India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining  internal financial controls based on the internal  control over financial reporting criteria established by  the respective Companies considering the essential  components of internal control stated in the Guidance  Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial  Reporting (the ‘Guidance Note’) issued by the Institute  of Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities  include the design, implementation and maintenance  of adequate internal financial controls that were  operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and  efficient conduct of its business, including adherence  to respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of  its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and  errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting  records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial  information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013. Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the  internal financial controls over financial reporting of the  Parent Company, based on our audit. We conducted our  audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the  Standards on Auditing, issued by Institute of Chartered  Accountants of India and deemed to be prescribed  under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to  the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial  controls and both issued by the Institute of Chartered  Accountants of India. Those Standards and the Guidance  Note require that we comply with ethical requirements  and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether adequate internal financial  controls over financial reporting was established and  maintained and if such controls operated effectively in  all material respects. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit  evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial  controls system over financial reporting and their  operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial  controls over financial reporting included obtaining  an understanding of internal financial controls over  financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material  weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design  and operating effectiveness of internal control based  on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend  on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of  the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated  Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and  the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms  of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph  below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis  for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls  system over financial reporting of the Parent Company,  its subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities,  which are companies incorporated in India. Other Matters 1.	 Our report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on  the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the  internal financial controls over financial reporting  of the Parent Company, its subsidiaries, associates  and jointly controlled entities, which are companies  incorporated in India, in so far as it relates to  separate financial statements of 122 subsidiaries 14  Jointly Controlled entities and 11 associates is based  on the corresponding reports of the auditors of  such subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled  entities, which are companies incorporated in India. 2.	 We do not comment on the adequacy and operating  effectiveness of the internal financial controls over  financial reporting of 6 subsidiaries and 1 associate  incorporated in India, whose financial statements  are unaudited and have been furnished to us by  the Management. 3.	 We further draw attention to Note 48(f) of the  accompanied Consolidated Financial Statements,  where in case of Mumbai International Airport  Limited, various investigations and enquiries are  pending. The implication on adequacy of subsidiary’s  Annexure – B to the Independent Auditor’s Report (Referred to in paragraph 1 (h) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of  our Report of even date)  ===== PAGE 383 ===== 501 Strategic Review Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements internal financial control and the operational  effectiveness of such control, if any, would be  known only after the investigations are concluded.  The component auditors of this subsidiary have  qualified their opinion in this regard. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over  Financial Reporting A company’s internal financial control over financial  reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable  assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting  and the preparation of financial statements for external  purposes in accordance with generally accepted  accounting principles. A company’s internal financial  control over financial reporting includes those policies  and procedures that: (1)	 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in  reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect  the transactions and dispositions of the assets  of the company; (2)	 provide reasonable assurance that transactions  are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of  financial statements in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles, and that receipts  and expenditures of the company are being  made only in accordance with authorizations of  management and directors of the company; and (3)	 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention  or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,  use, or disposition of the company’s assets that  could have a material effect on the financial statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls  over Financial Reporting Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial  controls over financial reporting, including the possibility  of collusion or improper management override of controls,  material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur  and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation  of the internal financial controls over financial reporting  to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal  financial control over financial reporting may become  inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that  the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures  may deteriorate. Opinion In our opinion, to the best of our information and  according to the explanations given to us and based on  the consideration of reports of the other auditors, as  referred to in Other Matters paragraph above, the Group,  its associates and jointly controlled entities, which are  companies incorporated in India, have maintained, in  all material respects, an adequate internal financial  controls system over financial reporting and such  internal financial controls over financial reporting were  operating effectively as at March 31, 2024, based on  the internal control over financial reporting criteria  established by the Parent Company considering the  essential components of internal control stated in the  Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Control  over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of  Chartered Accountants of India.

G. Highway, Khodiyar, Ahmedabad -  382421, Gujarat, India. Its shares are listed on the  BSE Limited and the National Stock Exchange of  India Limited. AEL along with its subsidiaries (''the  Group''), associates and jointly controlled entities  is a global integrated infrastructure player with  businesses spanning across integrated resources  management, mining services and commercial  mining, new energy ecosystem, data center, airports,  roads, copper, digital space, Food FMCG and others. 2	 MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES I.	 Basis of Preparation a)	 Statement of Compliance 	 The consolidated financial statements of the Group  have been prepared in accordance with Indian  Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under  Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with  the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards)  Rules, 2015, as amended from time to time and other  accounting principles generally accepted in India. 	 These consolidated financial statements have been  prepared under the historical cost convention with  the exception of certain assets and liabilities that  are required to be carried at fair values by Ind AS. 	 The Group's consolidated financial statements are  presented in INR except when otherwise stated.  All amounts have been rounded-off to the nearest  Crore, unless otherwise indicated and amounts less  than ` 50,000/- have been presented as ''0.00''. b)	 Principles of Consolidation 	 The consolidated financial statements comprise  the financial statements of the Company, its  subsidiaries and equity accounting of its investment  in associates and jointly controlled entities. 	 Control is achieved when the Group has:- 	 -	 Power over the investee 	 -	 Exposure or rights, to variable returns from its  involvement with the investee and 	 -	 The ability to use its power over the investee to  affect its returns 	 Generally, there is a presumption that a majority  of voting rights result in control. To support this  presumption and when the Group has less than  a majority of the voting or similar rights of an  investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and  circumstances in assessing whether it has power  over an investee, including: 	 -	 Rights  arising  from  other  contractual arrangements 	 -	 Potential voting rights held by the group  and other parties 	 -	 The size of the group’s holding of voting rights  relative to the size and dispersion of the  holdings of the other voting rights holders. 	 The Group re-assesses whether or not it controls  an investee if facts and circumstances indicate  that there are changes to one or more of the three  elements of control. Consolidation of a subsidiary  begins when the Group obtains control over the  subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control  of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and  expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed off  during the year are included in the consolidated  financial statements from the date the Group gains  control until the date the Group ceases to control  the subsidiary. 	 Consolidated financial statements are prepared using  uniform accounting policies for like transactions and  other events in similar circumstances. If a member of  the group uses accounting policies other than those  adopted in the consolidated financial statements,  appropriate adjustments are made to that group  member’s financial statements in preparing the  consolidated  financial  statements  to  ensure  conformity with the group’s accounting policies. 	 The financial statements of all the entities used  for the purpose of consolidation are drawn up to  same reporting date as that of the parent company.  When the end of the reporting period of the parent is  different from that of a subsidiary, jointly controlled  entities or associate, the respective entity prepares,  for consolidation purposes, additional financial  information as of the same date as the financial  statements of the parent to enable the parent to   ===== PAGE 393 ===== Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 511 Strategic Review Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements consolidate the financial information of the said  entity, unless it is impracticable to do so. 	 The consolidated financial statements have been  prepared on the following basis. 	 Subsidiaries 	 Subsidiaries are considered for consolidation when  the Group obtains control over the subsidiary  and are derecognised when the Group loses  control of the subsidiary. Subsidiaries have been  consolidated on a line-by-line basis by adding  together the book values of the like items of assets,  liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows.  Intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised  gains resulting on intra-group transactions are  eliminated in full. Unrealised losses resulting  from intra-group transactions are eliminated in  arriving at the carrying amount of assets unless  transaction provides an evidence of impairment of  transferred asset. 	 Non-controlling interests represent the portion of  profit or loss and net assets not held by the Group  and are presented separately in the Statement of  Profit and Loss and Consolidated Balance Sheet,  separately  from  parent  shareholders’  equity,  profit and loss and each component of other  comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed to the  equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the  non-controlling interests, even if this results in the  non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. 	 Changes in the Group’s ownership interests in  subsidiaries that do not result in the Group losing  control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as  equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the  Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests  are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative  interests in the subsidiaries. 	 Associates and Jointly Controlled Entities - Equity  Accounting 	 An associate is an entity over which the Group has  significant influence. Significant influence is the  power to participate in the financial and operating  policy decisions of the investee but is not control or  joint control over those policies. 	 A jointly controlled entity is a joint arrangement  whereby the parties that have joint control of the  arrangement have rights to the net assets of the  joint arrangement. Joint control is the contractually  agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which  exists only when decisions about the relevant  activities require unanimous consent of the parties  sharing control. 	 The results and assets and liabilities of associates  and jointly controlled entities are incorporated in  the consolidated financial statements using the  equity method of accounting. Under the equity  method, an investment in an associate or a jointly  controlled entity is initially recognised at cost and  adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group's share  of post acquisition profits or losses and that of other  comprehensive income of the associate or jointly  controlled entity. Distributions received from an  associate or a jointly controlled entity reduce the  carrying amount of the investment. Unrealised gains  and losses resulting from transactions between  the Group, Jointly Controlled Entity and Associate  entities are eliminated to the extent of the interest in  the Jointly Controlled Entity and Associate entities. 	 If an entity’s share of losses of an associate or  joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the  associate or joint venture (which includes any  long term interest that, in substance, form part  of the Group’s net investment in the associate or  joint venture), the entity discontinues recognising  its share of further losses. Additional losses are  recognised only to the extent that the Group has  incurred legal or constructive obligations or made  payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.  If the associate or joint venture subsequently  reports profits, the entity resumes recognising its  share of those profits only after its share of the  profits equals the share of losses not recognised. 	 After application of the equity method, at each  reporting date, the Group determines whether there  is objective evidence that the investment in the  associate or jointly controlled entity is impaired.  If there exists such evidence, the Group determines  extent of impairment and then recognises the loss  in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 	 Upon loss of significant influence over the associate  or joint control over the jointly controlled entity,  the Group measures and recognises any retained  investment at its fair value. Any difference between  the carrying amount of the associate or the jointly   ===== PAGE 394 ===== Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED 512 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 controlled entity and the fair value of the retained  investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised  in profit and loss. 	 Unincorporated Entities 	 In case of unincorporated entities in the nature  of a Joint Operation, the Group recognizes its  direct right and its share of jointly held or incurred  assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, revenues  and expenses of joint operations. These have been  incorporated in these financial statements under  the appropriate headings. 	 The list of Companies / Firms included in  consolidation, relationship with the Company and  shareholding therein is as under.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed  on an ongoing basis. 	 Key sources of estimation uncertainty 	 The key assumptions concerning the future and  other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the  reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing  a material adjustment to the carrying amounts  of assets and liabilities within the next financial  years, are described below. Existing circumstances  and assumptions about future developments may  change due to market changes or circumstances  arising that are beyond the control of the Group.  Such changes are reflected in the assumptions  when they occur. 	 Material estimates and assumptions are required  in particular for: 	 i)	 Useful life of property, plant and equipment  and intangible assets: 	 	 This involves determination of the estimated  useful life of property, plant and equipment  and intangible assets and the assessment  as to which components of the cost may be  capitalised. Useful life of these assets is based  on the life prescribed in Schedule II to the  Companies Act, 2013 or based on technical  estimates, taking into account the nature of  the asset, estimated usage, expected residual  values, anticipated technological changes,  maintenance support and operating conditions  of the asset. Management reviews its estimate  of the useful lives of depreciable/ amortisable  assets at each reporting date, based on the  expected utility of the assets. 	 ii)	 Impairment of Non Financial Asset : 	 	 Impairment exists when the carrying value  of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds  its recoverable amount, which is the higher  of its fair value less costs of disposal and  its value in use. The fair value less costs of  disposal calculation is based on available data  for similar assets or observable market prices  less incremental costs for disposing of the  asset. The value in use calculation is based  on a discounted future cashflows model.  The recoverable amount is sensitive to the  discount rate used for the discounted future  cashflows model as well as the expected future  cash-inflows and the growth rate used. 	 iii)	 Taxes: 	 	 Significant  judgements  are  involved  in  estimating budgeted profits for the purpose of  paying advance tax, determining the provision  for income taxes, including amount expected to  be paid/recovered for uncertain tax positions.  Significant management judgement is also  required to determine the amount of deferred  tax assets that can be recognised, based upon  the likely timing and the level of future taxable  profits together with future tax planning  strategies, including estimates of temporary  differences reversing on account of available  benefits from the tax laws applicable to  respective entities. 	 iv)	 Fair  value  measurement  of  financial instruments: 	 	 In estimating the fair value of financial assets  and financial liabilities, the Group uses market  observable data to the extent available.  Where such Level 1 inputs are not available,  the Group establishes appropriate valuation  techniques and inputs to the model. The inputs  to these models are taken from observable  markets where possible, but where this is not  feasible, a degree of judgment is required in  establishing fair values. Judgments include  considerations of inputs such as liquidity  risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in  assumptions about these factors could affect  the reported fair value of financial instruments. 	 v)	 Defined benefit plans: 	 	 The cost of the defined benefit plan and the  present value of the obligation are determined  using  actuarial  valuations.  An  actuarial  valuation involves making various assumptions  that may differ from actual developments in   ===== PAGE 407 ===== Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 525 Strategic Review Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements the future. These include the determination  of the discount rate, future salary increases,  attrition rate and mortality rates. Due to the  complexities involved in the valuation and its  long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation  is highly sensitive to changes in these  assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at  each reporting date. 	 vi)	 Inventory Measurement 	 	 Measurement of bulk inventory lying at  ports/ yards is material, complex and involves  significant judgement and estimate resulting  from measuring the surface area. The Group  performs physical counts of above inventory  on a periodic basis using internal / external  experts to perform volumetric surveys and  assessments, basis which the estimate of  quantity for these inventories is determined.  The variations noted between book records and  physical quantities of above inventories are  evaluated and appropriately accounted in the  books of accounts. 	 vii)	 Determination of lease term & discount rate : 	 	 Ind AS 116 Leases requires lessee to determine  the lease term as the non-cancellable period  of a lease adjusted with any option to extend  or terminate the lease, if the use of such  option is reasonably certain. The Group makes  assessment on the expected lease term on  lease by lease basis and thereby assesses  whether it is reasonably certain that any  options to extend or terminate the contract will  be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the  Group considers factors such as any significant  leasehold improvements undertaken over the  lease term, costs relating to the termination  of lease and the importance of the underlying  to the Group’s operations taking into account  the location of the underlying asset and  the availability of the suitable alternatives.  The lease term in future periods is reassessed  to ensure that the lease term reflects the  current economic circumstances. 	 	 The discount rate is generally based on the  incremental borrowing rate specific to the  lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases  with similar characteristics. 	 viii)	 Asset Retirement Obligation : 	 	 The liability for asset retirement obligations  are recognised when the Group has an  obligation to perform site restoration activity.  The recognition and measurement of asset  retirement obligations involves the use of  estimates and assumptions, viz. the timing of  abandonment of site facilities which would  depend upon the ultimate life of the project,  expected utilization of assets in other projects,  the scope of abandonment activity and pre-tax  rate applied for discounting. 	 ix)	 Recognition and measurement of Contingent  liabilities,  provisions  and  uncertain  tax positions: 	 	 There are various legal, direct and indirect tax  matters and other obligations including local  and state levies, availing input tax credits etc.,  which may impact the Group. Evaluation of  uncertain liabilities and contingent liabilities  arising out of above matters and recognition  and measurement of other provisions are based  on the assessment of the probability of an  outflow of resources, and on past experience  and circumstances known at the balance sheet  date. The actual outflow of resources at a  future date may therefore vary from the figure  included in other provisions. d)	 Current & Non-Current Classification 	 Any asset or liability is classified as current if it  satisfies any of the following conditions : i)	 The asset/liability is expected to be realised/ settled in the Group’s normal operating cycle; ii)	 The asset is intended for sale or consumption; iii)	 The asset/liability is held primarily for the  purpose of trading; iv)	 The asset/liability is expected to be realised/ settled  within  twelve  months  after  the  reporting period; v)	 The asset is cash or cash equivalent unless it  is restricted from being exchanged or used to  settle a liability for at least twelve months after  the reporting date; vi)	 In the case of a liability, the Group does not  have an unconditional right to defer settlement   ===== PAGE 408 ===== Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED 526 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 of the liability for at least twelve months after  the reporting date. 	 All other assets and liabilities are classified as  non-current. Deferred tax assets & liabilities  are  classified  as  non-current  assets  &  liabilities respectively. 	 For the purpose of current/non-current classification  of assets and liabilities, the Group has ascertained  its normal operating cycle as twelve months.  This is based on the nature of services and the time  between the acquisition of assets or inventories  for processing and their realisation in cash and  cash equivalents. II	 Summary of Material Accounting Policies a)	 Foreign Currency Transactions and Translations 	 i)	 Functional and Presentation Currency 	 	 The Consolidated financial statements are  presented in Indian Rupee (INR), which is the  functional and presentation currency of the  parent company. 	 ii)	 Transactions and Balances 	 	 Foreign currency transactions are translated  into  the  functional  currency,  for  initial  recognition, using the exchange rates at the  dates of the transactions. 	 	 All foreign currency denominated monetary  assets and liabilities are translated at the  exchange  rates  on  the  reporting  date.  Exchange differences arising on settlement or  translation of monetary items are recognised  in statement of profit and loss except to the  extent of exchange differences which are  regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on  foreign currency borrowings that are directly  attributable to the acquisition or construction  of qualifying assets which are capitalised  as cost of assets. Additionally, all exchange  gains or losses on foreign currency borrowings  taken prior to April 1, 2016 which are related  to the acquisition or construction of qualifying  assets are adjusted in the carrying cost of such  assets. Non-monetary items that are measured  in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency  are not retranslated. 	 iii)	 Group Companies 	 	 On consolidation, the assets and liabilities  of foreign operations are translated at the  exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date  and their statements of profit and loss are  translated using average rate of exchange  prevailing during the year, which approximates to  the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction  date. All resulting exchange differences arising  on translation for consolidation are recognised  in OCI. On disposal of a foreign operation, the  component of OCI relating to that particular  foreign operation is reclassified / recognised in  the statement of profit and loss. b)	 Non Current Assets held for Sale and Discontinued  Operations 	 The Group classifies Non Current assets (or  disposal group) and operations as held for sale or  as discontinued operations if their carrying amounts  will be recovered principally through a sale rather  than through continuing use. Classification as  a discontinued operations occurs upon disposal  or when the operation meets the below criteria  whichever earlier. 	 Non Current Assets are classified as held for sale  only when both the conditions are satisfied – 	 1.	 The sale is highly probable, and 	 2.	 The asset or disposal group is available for  immediate sale in its present condition subject  only to terms that are usual and customary for  sale of such assets. 	 Non-current  assets  which  are  subject  to  depreciation are not depreciated or amortized once  those classified as held for sale. 	 A discontinued operation is a component of the  Group's business, the operations of which can  be clearly distinguished from those of the rest  of the Group and 	 i)	 is part of a single co-ordinated plan to  dispose of a separate major line of business or  geographical area of operations; or 	 ii)	 is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a  view to resale.  ===== PAGE 409 ===== Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 527 Strategic Review Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 	 Non-current assets and disposal groups classified  as held for sale are measured at the lower of their  carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell.  Assets and associated liabilities classified as held  for sale are presented separately in the balance  sheet. The results of discontinued operations are  excluded from the overall results of the Group and  are presented separately as a single amount in the  statement of profit and loss. Also, the comparative  statement of profit and loss is re-presented as if the  operations had been discontinued from the start of  the comparative period. c)	 Cash & Cash Equivalents 	 Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposit  with banks. Cash equivalents are short-term  balances (with an original maturity of three months  or less from the date of acquisition), which are  subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. d)	 Property, Plant and Equipment 	 Recognition and Measurement 	 Property, Plant and Equipment, including Capital  Work in Progress, are stated at cost of acquisition  or construction less accumulated depreciation and  impairment losses, if any. Borrowing cost relating  to acquisition / construction of Property, Plant and  Equipment which takes substantial period of time  to get ready for its intended use are also included to  the extent they relate to the period till such assets  are ready to be put to use. 	 The present value of the expected cost for the  decommissioning of an asset after its use is included  in the cost of the respective asset if the recognition  criteria for a provision are met. 	 If significant parts of an item of property, plant and  equipment have different useful lives, then they are  accounted for as separate items (major components)  of property, plant and equipment. 	 The Group has elected to regard previous GAAP  carrying values of property, plant and equipment  as deemed cost at the date of transition to Ind AS  i.e April 1, 2015. 	 Subsequent Measurement 	 Subsequent expenditure related to an item of  Property, Plant and Equipment are included in its  carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset,  as appropriate, only when it is probable that the  future economic benefits associated with the item  will flow to the Group and the cost of the item  can be measured reliably. Subsequent costs are  depreciated over the residual life of the respective  assets. All other expenses on existing Property,  Plant  and  equipment,  including  day-to-day  repair and maintenance expenditure and cost of  replacing parts, are charged to the Statement of  Profit and Loss for the period during which such  expenses are incurred. 	 Capital Work in Progress 	 Expenditure  related  to  and  incurred  during  implementation of capital projects to get the assets  ready for intended use is included under “Capital  Work in Progress”. The same is allocated to the  respective items of property plant and equipment on  completion of construction/ erection of the capital  project/ property plant and equipment. The cost of  asset not ready for its intended use before the year  end & capital inventory are disclosed under Capital  work in progress. 	 Depreciation 	 Depreciation is provided using straight-line method  as specified in Schedule II to the Companies  Act, 2013 or based on technical estimates.  Depreciation on assets added / disposed off during  the year is provided on pro-rata basis with reference  to the date of addition / disposal. 	 Except incase of some overseas entities where  schedule II is not applicable, useful life is considered  based on management estimates or as per the  prevailing laws in those countries. 	 Oil & Gas assets : 	 Expenditure incurred prior to obtaining the right(s)  to explore, develop and produce oil and gas are  expensed off in the year of incurrence to the extent  of the efforts not successful. Expenditure incurred on  the acquisition of the license are initially capitalised  on a license by license basis. Costs including  indirect cost incurred for the block are held,  undepleted within ''Capital Work in Progress'' until  the exploration phase relating to the license area is  complete or commercial oil and gas reserves have  been discovered. Indirect costs are expensed off in  the year of incurrence.  ===== PAGE 410 ===== Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED 528 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 	 Exploratory/appraisal drilling costs are initially  capitalised within ''Capital Work in Progress'' on a  block by block basis until the success or otherwise  of the block is established. The success or failure  of each exploration/appraisal effort is judged  on a block basis. 	 Where results of seismic studies or exploration  drilling indicate the presence of oil and gas reserves  which are ultimately not considered commercially  recoverable and no additional exploratory activity  is firmly planned, all related costs are written off  to the Statement of Profit and Loss in the year of  cessation of the exploration activity. 	 Any  payment  made  towards  fulfilment  of  commitment under the contracts from earlier  periods continues to be included under Exploration  and Evaluation Assets at its carried value in  accordance with Ind AS 101. 	 Exploration and Evaluation assets : 	 Exploration and evaluation expenditure comprises  cost that are directly attributable to : 	  -	 Cost of acquiring mining and exploration  tenements; 	  - 	 Research  and  analysing  historical  exploration data; 	 -	 Conducting topographical, geochemical and  geophysical studies; 	 -	 Conducting  exploratory  drilling,  trenching and sampling; 	 -	 Examining and testing extraction and treatment  methods; and/or 	  -	 Compiling prefeasibility and feasibility studies. 	 Exploration expenditure relates to the initial search  for mineral deposits with economic potential.  Evaluation  expenditure  arises  from  detailed  assessment of deposits or other projects that have  been identified as having economic potential. 	 Exploration and evaluation expenditure is charged  to Statement of Profit and Loss as incurred unless  the directors are confident of the project's technical  and commercial feasibility and it is probable that  economic benefits will flow to the Group, in which  case expenditure may be capitalised. 	 Capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure  is treated as a tangible asset and is recorded at  cost less any accumulated impairment charges.  No amortisation is charged during the exploration  and evaluation phase as the assets is not  available for use. 	 Derecognition 	 An item of property, plant and equipment is  derecognised upon disposal or when no future  economic benefits are expected to arise from  continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising  on the disposal or retirement of property, plant and  equipment is determined as the difference between  the sale proceeds and the carrying amount of  the assets and is recognised in the Consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss. e)	 Investment Properties 	 i)	 Assets which are held for long-term rental  yields or for capital appreciation or both,  are  classified  as  Investment  Properties.  Investment properties are measured initially at  cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to  initial recognition, investment properties are  stated at cost less accumulated depreciation  and accumulated impairment loss, if any. 	 	 The Group has elected to regard previous GAAP  carrying values of investment properties as  deemed cost at the date of transition to Ind AS  i.e April 1, 2015. 	 ii)	 The Group depreciates investment properties  over their estimated useful lives as specified in  Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013. 	 iii)	 Investment properties are derecognised /  transferred when they have been disposed off,  have been used for own purpose of the Company  or when they have permanently withdrawn from  use and no future economic benefit is expected  from their disposal. The difference between the  net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount  of the asset is recognised in Statement of Profit  and Loss in the period in which the property  is derecognised. f)	 Intangible Assets 	 i)	 Intangible assets are measured on initial  recognition at cost and are subsequently carried   ===== PAGE 411 ===== Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 529 Strategic Review Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements at cost less any accumulated amortisation  and accumulated impairment losses, if any.  Internally generated intangibles other than  software and applications are not capitalised.  In  case  of  softwares  and  applications,  production costs associated with development  of original content are capitalised. 	 	 Mine Development Assets include expenses  pertaining to land and mine development,  initial overburden removal, environmental and  other regulatory approvals etc. It represents  expenses incurred towards development of  mines where the Company is operating as  operator and developer. 	 	 The Group has intangible assets in the nature  of right to collect toll charges which are  capitalised as intangible asset on the appointed  date and having useful life over the period in  terms of concession agreement. 	 	 The Group has intangible assets in the nature  of airport operation rights having useful life  over period of operation agreement which are  capitalised as intangible asset on the appointed  date in terms of concession agreement. 	 	 The Group has elected to regard previous  GAAP carrying values of intangible asset as  deemed cost at the date of transition to Ind AS  i.e April 1, 2015. 	 ii)	 The intangible assets with finite lives are  amortised over the useful economic life and  assessed for impairment whenever there is  an indication that the intangible asset may  be impaired. The Group reviews amortisation  period on an annual basis. 	 	 Intangible assets are amortised on straight line  basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Intangible Assets Estimated Useful Life  (Years) Software applications 3-5 Years based on  management estimate Mine Development  Assets Over a period of  underlying contract Right to collect toll  charges 20 years based on  concession agreement Airport operation  rights Over a period of operation  agreement 	 iii)	 Expenditure incurred during development of  intangible assets is included under “Intangible  Assets under Development”. The same is  allocated to the respective items of intangible  assets on completion of the project. 	 iv)	 Gains or losses arising from derecognition  of an intangible asset are measured as the  difference between the net disposal proceeds  and the carrying amount of the asset and are  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss  when the asset is derecognised. g)	 Impairment of Non-Financial Assets 	 i)	 At the end of each reporting period, the  Group reviews the carrying amounts of its  tangible and intangible assets to determine  whether there is any indication that those  assets have suffered an impairment loss.  If any such indication exists, the recoverable  amount of the asset is estimated in order to  determine the extent of the impairment loss  (if any). When it is not possible to estimate  the recoverable amount of an individual asset,  the Group estimates the recoverable amount  of the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which  the asset belongs. Each CGU represents the  smallest group of assets that generates cash  inflows that are largely independent of the  cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. When a  reasonable and consistent basis of allocation  can be identified, corporate assets are also  allocated to individual cash-generating units,  or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest  group of cash-generating units for which a  reasonable and consistent allocation basis  can be identified. ii)	 Recoverable amount is the higher of fair  value less costs of disposal and value in use.  In assessing value in use, the estimated future  cash flows are discounted to their present  value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects  current market assessments of the time value  of money and the risks specific to the asset for  which the estimates of future cash flows have  not been adjusted. iii)	 If the recoverable amount of an asset (or  cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less  than its carrying amount, the carrying amount   ===== PAGE 412 ===== Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED 530 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced  to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss  is recognised immediately in the Statement of  Consolidated Profit or Loss. iv)	 Assets  (other  than  goodwill)  for  which  impairment loss has been recognised in prior  periods, the Group reviews at each reporting  date whether there is any indication that  the loss has decreased or no longer exists.  When  an  impairment  loss  subsequently  reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or  a cash-generating unit) is increased to the  revised estimate of its recoverable amount,  so that the increased carrying amount does  not exceed the carrying amount that would  have been determined had no impairment loss  been recognised. A reversal of an impairment  loss is recognised immediately in Consolidated  Statement of Profit and Loss. v)	 Impairment is determined for goodwill by  assessing the recoverable amount of CGU  to which such goodwill relates. When the  recoverable amount of the CGU is less than  its carrying amount, an impairment loss is  recognised. Impairment losses relating to  goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods. h)	 Service Concession Arrangements Service Concession Arrangements (SCA) refers to an  arrangement between the grantor (a public sector  entity) and the operator (a private sector entity) to  provide services that give the public access to major  economic and social facilities utilising private sector  funds and expertise. With respect to SCA, revenue and costs are allocated  between those relating to construction services and  those relating to operation and maintenance services,  and accounted for separately. The infrastructure  used in a concession are classified as an intangible  asset or a financial asset, depending on the nature  of the payment entitlements under the SCA.  When the Company has an unconditional right to  receive cash or another financial asset from or at  the direction of the grantor, such right is recognised  as a financial asset and is subsequently measured  at amortised cost. When the demand risk is with the  Group and it has right to charge the user for use  of facility, the right is recognised as an intangible  asset and is subsequently measured at cost less  accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.  The intangible assets are amortised over a period of  service concession arrangements. i)	 Government Grants 	 Government grants are recognised at their fair value  where there is reasonable assurance that the grant  will be received and all attached conditions will  be complied with. 	 When the grant relates to an expense item, it is  deferred and recognised as income in the Statement  of Profit and Loss on a systematic basis over the  periods necessary to match the related costs, which  they are intended to compensate. 	 When the grant relates to an asset or a non-monetary  item, it is recognised as deferred income under  liabilities and is recognised as income in the  Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight line basis  over the expected useful life of the related asset or  a non-monetary item. j)	 Financial Instruments 	 A financial instrument is any contract that gives  rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial  liability or equity instrument of another entity. 	 Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially  measured at fair value, except for trade receivables  which are measured at transaction price. 	 The Group’s financial assets comprise of trade  receivables, cash and cash equivalents, other bank  balances and deposits, interest accrued, security  deposits, intercorporate deposits, contract assets  and other receivables. These assets are measured  subsequently at amortised cost. 	 The  Group's  financial  liabilities  comprise  of  borrowings, lease liabilities, retention and capital  creditors, Interest accrued, deposit from customers,  contract liabilities, trade and other payables. 	 Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset  when the Group has a legally enforceable right  (not contingent on future events) to off-set the  recognised amounts either to settle on a net basis,  or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities  simultaneously.  ===== PAGE 413 ===== Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 531 Strategic Review Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 	 An equity instrument is any contract that evidences  a residual interest in the assets of an entity after  deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments  issued by a Group entity are recognised at the  proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 	 A)	 Financial Assets 	 	 Initial Recognition 	 	 All financial assets, except trade receivables,  are initially recognised at fair value. 	 	 Subsequent measurement 	 	 Business Model Assessment 	 	 The Group makes an assessment of the  objectives of the business model in which a  financial asset is held because it best reflects  the way business is managed and information  is provided to management. The assessment  of business model comprises the stated  policies and objectives of the financial assets,  management strategy for holding the financial  assets, the risk that affects the performance  etc.  Further  management  also  evaluates  whether the contractual cash flows are solely  payment of principal and interest considering  the contractual terms of the instrument. 	 The subsequent measurement of financial assets  depends on their classification, as described below: 	 1)	 At amortised cost 	 	 A financial asset is measured at the amortised  cost if both the following conditions are met : 	 	 (a)	 The asset is held within a business model  whose objective is to hold assets for  collecting contractual cash flows, and 	 	 (b)	 Contractual terms of the asset give rise, on  specified dates, to cash flows that are solely  payments of principal and interest (SPPI)  on the principal amount outstanding. 	 	 After initial measurement, such financial assets  are subsequently measured at amortised  cost using the effective interest rate (EIR)  method. The EIR amortisation is included in  finance income in the Statement of Profit and  Loss. The losses arising from impairment are  recognised in the profit or loss. This category  generally applies to trade and other receivables. 	 	 The effective interest rate is the rate that  exactly  discounts  estimated  future  cash  receipts (including all fees and transaction costs  and other premiums or discounts) through the  expected life of the financial assets, or where  appropriate, a shorter period, to the gross  carrying amount on initial recognition. 	 2)	 At fair value through other comprehensive  income (FVTOCI) 	 	 A financial asset is classified as at the FVTOCI if  both of the following criteria are met: 	 	 (a)	 The objective of the business model  is  achieved  both  by  collecting  contractual cash flows and selling the  financial assets, and 	 	 (b)	 Contractual terms of the asset give rise on  specified dates to cash flows that are solely  payments of principal and interest (SPPI)  on the principal amount outstanding. 	 	 Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI  category are measured initially as well as at each  reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements  are recognised in the other comprehensive  income (OCI) and on derecognition, cumulative  gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is  reclassified to Statement of Profit and Loss.  For equity instruments, the Group may make  an irrevocable election to present subsequent  changes in the fair value in OCI. If the Group  decides to classify an equity instrument as  at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the  instrument, excluding dividends, are recognised  in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts  from OCI to the Statement of Profit and Loss,  even on sale of investment. 	 3)	 At fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) 	 	 Financial assets which are not measured at  amortised cost or FVTOCI and are held for  trading are measured at FVTPL. 	 	 In addition, the Group may elect to designate  a debt instrument, which otherwise meets  amortised cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL.  However, such election is allowed only if doing  so reduces or eliminates a measurement or  recognition inconsistency (referred to as  ‘accounting mismatch’).  ===== PAGE 414 ===== Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED 532 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 	 	 Equity investments 	 	 All equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109  are measured at fair value. The Group may  make an irrevocable election to present in other  comprehensive income subsequent changes  in the fair value. The Group makes such  election on an instrument-by-instrument basis.  The classification is made on initial recognition  and is irrevocable. 	 	 If the Group decides to classify an equity  instrument as FVTOCI, then all fair value  changes  on  the  instrument,  excluding  dividends, are recognised in the OCI. There is no  recycling of the amounts from OCI to profit and  loss, even on sale of investment. However, the  Group may transfer the cumulative gain or  loss within equity. 	 	 Equity instruments included within the FVTPL  category are measured at fair value with all  changes recognised in the profit and loss. 	 	 Derecognition 	 	 On derecognition of a financial asset, the  difference between the asset’s carrying amount  and the sum of the consideration received and  receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that  had been recognised in other comprehensive  income and accumulated in equity is recognised  in profit or loss if such gain or loss would have  otherwise been recognised in profit or loss on  disposal of that financial asset. 	 	 Impairment of Financial Assets 	 	 The Group applies Expected Credit Loss (ECL)  model for measurement and recognition of  impairment loss on the financial assets and  credit risk exposure. The Group assesses on  a forward looking basis the expected credit  losses associated with its receivables based on  historical trends and past experience. 	 	 The Group follows 'Simplified Approach’ for  recognition of impairment loss allowance on all  trade receivables or contractual receivables. 	 	 ECL is the difference between all contracted  cash flows that are due to the Group in  accordance with the contract and all the  cash flows that the Group expects to receive,  discounted at the original EIR. ECL impairment  loss allowance (or reversal) recognised during  the period is recognised as income / (expense)  in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 	 B)	 Financial Liabilities 	 	 Financial liabilities are classified, at initial  recognition as at amortised cost or fair value  through profit or loss. The measurement  of  financial  liabilities  depends  on  their  classification, as described below: 	 	 At amortised cost 	 	 This is the category most relevant to the Group.  After initial recognition, financial liabilities are  subsequently measured at amortised cost using  the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised  in Statement of Profit and Loss when the  liabilities are derecognised as well as through  the EIR amortisation process. Amortised cost is  calculated by taking into account any discount  or premium on acquisition and fees or costs  that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR  amortisation is included as finance costs in the  Statement of Profit and Loss. 	 	 The effective interest method is a method of  calculating the amortised cost of a financial  liability and of allocating interest expense over  the relevant period. The effective interest rate  is the rate that exactly discounts estimated  future cash payments (including all fees and  points paid or received that form an integral  part of the effective interest rate, transaction  costs and other premiums or discounts) through  the expected life of the financial liability, or  (where appropriate) a shorter period, to the net  carrying amount on initial recognition. 	 	 At fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) 	 	 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit  or loss include financial liabilities held for  trading and financial liabilities designated  upon initial recognition as such. Subsequently,  any changes in fair value are recognised in the  Statement of Profit and Loss. 	 	 Derecognition of Financial Liability 	 	 A financial liability is derecognised when the  obligation under the liability is discharged   ===== PAGE 415 ===== Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 533 Strategic Review Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements or  cancelled  or  expires.  An  exchange  with a lender of debt instruments with  substantially different terms is accounted for  as an extinguishment of the original financial  liability and the recognition of a new financial  liability. Similarly, a substantial modification  of the terms of an existing financial liability  is accounted for as an extinguishment of the  original financial liability and the recognition of  a new financial liability. 	 C)	 Derivative financial instruments 	 	 Initial recognition and subsequent measurement 	 	 The Group uses derivative financial instruments  such as forward, options currency contracts and  currency swaps to hedge its foreign currency  risks. Such derivative financial instruments  are initially recognised and subsequently  measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried  as financial assets when the fair value is  positive and as financial liabilities when the fair  value is negative. 	 	 Any gains or losses arising from changes in the  fair value of derivative financial instrument  are recognised in the Statement of Profit and  Loss and reported with foreign exchange gains/ (loss). Changes in fair value and gains/(losses)  on settlement of foreign currency derivative  financial instruments relating to borrowings,  which have not been designated as hedge  are recorded as finance expense and those  pertaining to the effective portion of cash  flow hedges is recognised in OCI and later  reclassified to profit or loss when the hedge  item affects profit or loss or treated as basis  adjustment if a hedged forecast transaction  subsequently results in the recognition of a  non-financial asset or non-financial liability. k)	 Hedge Accounting 	 Few Subsidiaries of the group designates certain  hedging instruments, which include derivatives  in respect of foreign currency risk, as cash  flow hedges. To qualify for hedge accounting,  the hedging relationship must meet all of the  following requirements: 	 -	 there is an economic relationship between the  hedged items and the hedging instruments, 	 -	 the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is  the same as that resulting from the quantity of  the hedged item that the entity actually hedges  and the quantity of the hedging instrument  that the entity actually uses to hedge that  quantity of hedged item. 	 -	 the effect of credit risk does not dominate  the value changes that result from that  economic relationship. At the inception of  the hedge relationship, the entity documents  the  relationship  between  the  hedging  instrument and hedged item, along with its risk  management objectives and its strategy for  undertaking various hedge transactions. 	 Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on  an ongoing basis, it is documented whether the  hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting  changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged  item attributable to the hedged risk. 	 Cash flow hedges 	 Above companies designate derivative contracts or  non derivative financial assets / liabilities as hedging  instruments to mitigate the risk of movement in  interest rates and foreign exchange rates for foreign  exchange exposure on highly probable future cash  flows attributable to a recognised asset or liability  or forecast cash transactions. 	 When a derivative is designated as a cash flow  hedging instrument, the effective portion of  changes in the fair value of the derivative / hedging  instruments is recognized in the cash flow hedging  reserve being part of other comprehensive income.  The effective portion of cash flow hedges is adjusted  to the lower of the cumulative gain or loss on the  hedging instrument and the cumulative change in  fair value of the hedged item. 	 Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value  of the derivative is recognized immediately in  the Statement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging  relationship no longer meets the criteria for  hedge accounting, then hedge accounting is  discontinued prospectively. 	 If the hedging instrument expires or is sold,  terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or  loss on the hedging instrument recognized in cash  flow hedging reserve till the period the hedge was   ===== PAGE 416 ===== Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED 534 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 effective remains in cash flow hedging reserve until  the underlying transaction occurs. The cumulative  gain or loss previously recognized in the cash flow  hedging reserve is transferred to the Statement  of Profit and Loss upon the occurrence of the  underlying transaction. 	 For cash flow hedges, the amount accumulated in  OCI is reclassified to profit or loss as reclassification  adjustment in the same period or periods during  which the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss. l)	 Income Taxes 	 Income tax expense comprises current tax expense  and the net change in the deferred tax asset or  liability during the year. Current and deferred taxes  are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss,  except when they relate to items that are recognised  in other comprehensive income or directly in equity,  in which case, the current and deferred tax are  also recognised in other comprehensive income or  directly in equity, respectively. 	 i)	 Current Income Tax 	 	 Provision for current tax is measured at the  amount of tax expected to be payable on the  taxable income for the year as determined in  accordance with the provisions of the tax laws  of the concerned jurisdiction. Current income  tax assets and liabilities are measured at the  amount expected to be recovered from or paid  to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and  tax laws used to compute the amount are those  that are enacted or substantially enacted, at the  reporting date for each concerned jurisdiction. 	 	 Current income tax relating to items recognised  outside the statement of profit and loss is  recognised outside the statement of profit and  loss (either in other comprehensive income  (OCI) or in equity). The Group periodically  evaluates positions taken in the tax returns  with respect to situations in which applicable  tax regulations are subject to interpretation  and establishes provisions where appropriate. 	 	 Current tax assets and liabilities are offset  where the Group has a legally enforceable right  to offset and intends either to settle on a net  basis, or to realise the asset and settle the  liability simultaneously. 	 ii)	 Deferred Tax 	 	 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised  for  deductible  and  taxable  temporary  differences arising between the tax base of  assets and liabilities and their carrying amount,  except when the deferred tax arises from the  initial recognition of an asset or liability in a  transaction that is not a business combination  and affects neither accounting nor taxable  profit or loss at the time of the transaction. 	 	 Deferred tax assets are recognised to the  extent that it is probable that taxable profit  will be available against which the deductible  temporary differences, and the carry forward  of unused tax credits and unused tax losses  can be utilised. 	 	 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured  at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the  year when the asset is realised or the liability is  settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that  have been enacted or substantively enacted at  the reporting date. 	 	 Deferred tax includes MAT tax credit. The Group  recognises tax credits in the nature of MAT  credit as an asset only to the extent that there  is convincing evidence that the Group will pay  normal income tax during the specified period,  i.e., the period for which tax credit is allowed  to be carried forward. In the year in which the  Group recognises tax credits as an asset, the  said asset is created by way of tax credit to  the consolidated statement of profit and loss.  The Group reviews such tax credit asset at each  reporting date to assess its recoverability. m)	 Inventories i)	 Inventories are valued at lower of cost or net  realisable value. ii)	 Cost of inventories have been computed to  include all costs of purchases, cost of conversion,  all non refundable duties & taxes and other  costs incurred in bringing the inventories to  their present location and condition. iii)	 The basis of determining cost for various  categories of inventories are as follows: 	 	 Raw Material		 :  Weighted Average Cost  ===== PAGE 417 ===== Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 535 Strategic Review Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements 	 	 Traded Goods		 : 	 Weighted Average Cost 	 	 Stores and Spares	: 	 Weighted Average Cost 	 	 Work-in-progress	 : 	 Weighted Average Cost 	 	 Finished Goods	 : 	 Weighted Average Cost 	 iv)	 Net realisable value is the estimated selling  price in the ordinary course of business,  less  estimated  cost  of  completion  and  estimated cost necessary to make the sale.  Necessary adjustment for shortage / excess  stock is given based on the available evidence  and past experience of the Group. n)	 Provision, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent  Assets 	 Provisions are recognised for when the Group has at  present, legal or contractual obligation as a result  of past events, only if it is probable that an outflow  of resources embodying economic outgo or loss  will be required and if the amount involved can be  measured reliably. If the effect of the time value of  money is material, provisions are discounted using a  current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate,  the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is  used, the increase in the provision due to the passage  of time is recognised as a finance cost. The Group  recognises provision for asset retirement obligation  in accordance with the mining services contract. 	 Contingent liabilities being a possible obligation as a  result of past events, the existence of which will be  confirmed only by the occurrence or non occurrence  of one or more future events not wholly in control  of the Group are not recognised in the accounts.  The nature of such liabilities and an estimate of  its financial effect are disclosed in notes to the  financial statements. 	 Contingent assets are not recognised in the  financial statements. the nature of such assets and  an estimate of its financial effect are disclosed in  notes to the financial statements. o)	 Revenue recognition 	 Revenue from contract with customer is recognised  upon transfer of control of promised products or  services to customers on complete satisfaction of  performance obligations for an amount that reflects  the consideration which the Group expects to  receive in exchange for those products or services.  Revenue is measured based on the transaction price,  which is the consideration, adjusted for discounts  and other incentives, if any, as per contracts with the  customers. Revenue also excludes taxes collected  from customers in its capacity as agent. 	 The specific recognition criteria described below  must also be met before revenue is recognised. 	 i)	 Sale of Goods 	 	 Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised  when the control of the goods has been passed  to the customer as per the terms of agreement  and there is no continuing effective control or  managerial involvement with the goods. 	 ii)	 Rendering of Services 	 	 Revenue from services rendered is recognised  when the work is performed and as per the  terms of agreement. 	 iii)	 Service Concession Arrangements 	 	 Revenue related to construction services  provided under service concession arrangement  is recognised based on the stage of completion  of  the  work  performed.  Operation  and  maintenance services revenue with respect to  intangible assets is recognised in the period in  which the services are provided by the Group.  Finance income is recognised using effective  interest rate method for financial assets. 	 iv)	 Dividends 	 	 Revenue is recognised when the Group’s  right to receive the payment is established,  which  is  generally  when  shareholders  approve the dividend. 	 v)	 Interest Income 	 	 Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by  reference to the principal outstanding and at  the effective interest rate applicable, which  is the rate that exactly discounts estimated  future cash receipts through the expected  life of the financial asset to that asset's net  carrying amount on initial recognition. 	 	 Contract Assets 	 	 A contract asset is the right to consideration  in exchange for goods or services transferred  to the customer. If the Group performs by   ===== PAGE 418 ===== Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED 536 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 transferring goods or services to a customer  before the customer pays consideration or  before payment is due, a contract asset is  recognised for the earned consideration that is  conditional. The same is disclosed under Other  Current Financial Assets. 	 	 Trade Receivable 	 	 A receivable represents the Group's right to an  amount of consideration that is unconditional  i.e. only the passage of time is required before  payment of consideration is due. 	 	 Contract Liability 	 	 A contract liability is the obligation to transfer  goods or services to a customer for which  the Group has received consideration (or an  amount of consideration is due) from the  customer. Contract liabilities are recognised as  revenue when the Group performs under the  contract The same is disclosed as under Other  Current Liabilities. p)	 Employee Benefits 	 Employee benefits includes gratuity, compensated  absences, contribution to provident fund, employees'  state insurance and superannuation fund. 	 i)	 Short Term Employee Benefits 	 	 Employee benefits payable wholly within twelve  months of rendering the services are classified  as short term employee benefits and recognised  in the period in which the employee renders  the related service. These are recognised at the  undiscounted amount of the benefits expected  to be paid in exchange for that service. 	 ii)	 Share-based payment transactions 	 	 The grant date fair value of equity settled  share-based  payment  awards  granted  to  employees is recognised as an employee  benefits  expense,  with  a  corresponding  increase in equity, over the period that the  employees unconditionally become entitled  to the awards. The amount recognised as  expense is based on the estimate of the  number of awards for which the related service  conditions are expected to be met, such  that the amount ultimately recognised as an  expense is based on the number of awards that  do meet the related service and non-market  vesting  conditions  at  the  vesting  date. In case of forfeiture/lapse/surrender stock  option,  which  is  not  vested,  amortised  portion is reversed by credit to employee  compensation expense. In a situation where  the stock option expires unexercised, the  related balance standing to the credit of the  Share based payment reserve, is transferred  within other equity. 	 iii)	 Post Employment Benefits 	 	 Defined Contribution Plans 	 	 Retirement benefits in the form of provident  fund and superannuation fund are defined  contribution schemes. The Group has no  obligation,  other  than  the  contribution  payable to these funds. The Group recognises  contribution payable to these funds as an  expense, when an employee renders the  related service. If the contribution payable to  the scheme for service received before the  balance sheet date exceeds the contribution  already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme  is recognised as a liability after deducting the  contribution already paid. 	 	 Defined Benefit Plans 	 	 The Group operates a defined benefit gratuity  plan. The cost of providing benefits under  the defined benefit plan is determined based  on actuarial valuation, carried out by an  independent actuary, using the projected  unit credit method. The liability for gratuity is  funded annually to a gratuity funds maintained  with the Life Insurance Corporation of India  and SBI Life Insurance Company Limited. 	 	 Re-measurements gains and losses arising  from experience adjustments, changes in  actuarial assumptions and the return on plan  assets (excluding net interest) are recognised  immediately in the balance sheet with a  corresponding debit or credit to retained  earnings  through  other  comprehensive  income in the period in which they occur.  Re-measurements are not reclassified to  Statement of Profit and Loss in subsequent  periods. Net interest is calculated by applying   ===== PAGE 419 ===== Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 537 Strategic Review Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements the discount rate to the net balance of defined  benefit liability or asset. 	 	 The Group recognises the following changes  in the net defined benefit obligation as an  expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss in  the line item ''Employee Benefits Expense'': 	  	 -	 Service cost including current service  cost,  past  service  cost,  gains  and  losses on curtailments and non-routine  settlements; and 	  	 -	 Net interest expense or income 	 iv)	 Other Employee Benefits 	 	 Other  employee  benefits  comprise  of  compensated absences/leaves. The actuarial  valuation is done as per projected unit credit  method. Remeasurements as a result of  experience  adjustments  and  changes  in  actuarial assumptions are recognised in the  Statement of Profit and Loss. 	 v)	 For the purpose of presentation of defined  benefit plans and other long term benefits,  the  allocation  between  current  and  non-current provisions has been made as  determined by an actuary. q)	 Borrowing Costs 	 Borrowing costs directly attributable to the  acquisition, construction or production of a  qualifying asset that necessarily takes a substantial  period of time to get ready for its intended use or  sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.  Borrowing costs consist of interest and other  costs that an entity incurs in connection with the  borrowing of funds. Transaction costs in respect of  long-term borrowings are amortised over the tenor  of respective loans using effective interest method.  All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period  in which they are incurred. Borrowing costs also  includes exchange differences arising from foreign  currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded  as an adjustment to the borrowing costs. r)	 Leases 	 The Group assesses whether a contract contains a  lease, at the inception of the contract. A contract is,  or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right  to control the use of an identified asset for a period  of time in exchange for consideration. 	 Group as a lessee 	 The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a  lease liability at the lease commencement date.  The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost,  which comprises the initial amount of the lease  liability adjusted for any lease payments made at  or before the commencement date, plus any initial  direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to  dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to  restore the site on which it is located, less any lease  incentives received. 	 Certain lease arrangements include the option to  extend or terminate the lease before the end of  the lease term. The right-of-use assets and lease  liabilities include these options when it is reasonably  certain that the option will be exercised. 	 The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated  using  the  straight-line  method  from  the  commencement date to the earlier of the end of  the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end  of the lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset  is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any,  and adjusted for certain re-measurements of the  lease liability. 	 The lease liability is initially measured at the present  value of the lease payments that are not paid at the  commencement date, discounted using the interest  rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot  be readily determined, the Group's incremental  borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its  incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. 	 The lease liability is subsequently measured at  amortised cost using the effective interest method.  It is remeasured when there is a change in future  lease payments arising from a change in an index or  rate, if there is a change in the Group's estimate of  the amount expected to be payable under a residual  value guarantee, or if there is a change in the lease  payments or a change in the assessment of an  option to purchase the underlying asset. 	 For a lease modification that is not a separate lease,  at the effective date of the modification, the lessee  accounts for the lease modification by remeasuring   ===== PAGE 420 ===== Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED 538 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 the lease liability using a discount rate determined  at that date and the lessee makes a corresponding  adjustment to the right-of-use asset. 	 When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a  corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying  amount of the right-of-use asset or is recorded in  profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of- use asset has been reduced to zero. 	 Lease payments have been classified as financing  activities in Statement of Cash Flow. 	 The Group has elected not to recognise right-of- use assets and lease liabilities for short term leases  that have a lease term of less than or equal to 12  months with no purchase option and assets with  low value leases. The Group recognises the lease  payments associated with these leases as an  expense in statement of profit and loss over the  lease term. The related cash flows are classified as  operating activities. 	 Group as a lessor 	 Leases in which the Group does not transfer  substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership  of an asset are classified as operating leases.  Rental income from operating lease is recognised  on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant  lease. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in  the period in which they are earned. 	 Leases are classified as finance leases when  substantially all of the risks and rewards of  ownership transfer from the Group to the lessee.  Amounts due from lessees under finance leases  are recorded as receivables at the Group’s net  investment in the leases. Finance lease income  is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect  a constant periodic rate of return on the net  investment outstanding in respect of the lease. s)	 Business Combination 	 Business combinations are accounted for using the  acquisition method of accounting. The cost of an  acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets  transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities  assumed at their acquisition date i.e. the date on  which control is acquired. Contingent consideration  to be transferred is recognised at fair value  and included as part of cost of acquisition.  Transaction related costs are expensed in the period  in which the costs are incurred. For each business  combination, the Group elects whether to measure  the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair  value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s  identifiable net assets. 	 Where the aggregate of consideration transferred  and  amount  recognised  for  non-controlling  interests exceeds the fair value of net identifiable  assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the excess  is recorded as goodwill. After initial recognition,  goodwill is tested for impairment annually and  measured at cost less any accumulated impairment  losses if any. Alternatively, in case of a bargain  purchase wherein the aggregate of consideration  transferred  and  amount  recognised  for  non-controlling interests is lower than the fair value  of net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities  assumed, the difference is recognised as capital  reserve within equity. 	 If the initial accounting for a business combination  is incomplete by the end of reporting period in  which the combination occurs, the Group reports  provisional amounts for the items for which the  accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts  are adjusted during the measurement period, or  additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to  reflect new information obtained about facts and  circumstances that existed at the acquisition date  that, if known, would have affected the amount  recognised at that date. 	 Business combinations involving entities under  common control are accounted for using the  pooling of interest method, wherein the assets and  liabilities of the business acquired are reflected at  carrying value. t)	 Earnings Per Share (EPS) 	 Basic EPS is computed by dividing the profit or  loss attributable to the owners of the Group by  the weighted average number of equity shares  outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is  computed by dividing the profit or loss attributable  to owners of the Company (after adjusting for costs  associated with dilutive potential equity shares)  by the weighted average number of equity shares  and dilutive potential equity shares outstanding  during the year.  ===== PAGE 421 ===== Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 539 Strategic Review Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements u)	 Service Work in Progress 	 Service Work in Progress is valued at lower of cost  and net realisable value. Cost is determined based  on Weighted Average Cost Method. 	 Service Work In Progress represents closing  inventory of Washed Coal and Iron Ore which is  not owned by the Group as per the terms of Mine  Development  and  Operation  (MDO)  contract.  Hence, this represents work performed under  contractual liability in bringing this inventory to its  present condition and location. 	 Net realisable value is the contract price as per  the Mining Development and Operation (MDO)  agreement , less the estimated costs of completion  and estimated costs necessary to make the sale. v)	 Overburden Cost Adjustment 	 Overburden removal expenses incurred during  production stage are charged to revenue based on  waste-to-ore ratio, (commonly known as Stripping  Ratio in the industry). This ratio is taken based on  the current operational phase of overall mining  area. To the extent the current period ratio exceeds  the expected Stripping Ratio of a phase, excess  overburden costs are deferred. w)	 Expenditure 	 Expenses  are  net  of  taxes  recoverable,  where applicable.  ===== PAGE 422 ===== ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED 540 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 3.

During March 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic had caused MIAL to invoke force majeure provision under the  Operation, Management and Development Agreement ('OMDA') against the Airports Authority of India ('AAI')  due to significant reduction in operations, and had thus claimed relief from AAI towards, inter alia, excuse/ suspension from discharging its annual fee obligations. 	 This matter went under arbitration before the Arbitral Tribunal. During the course of arbitration, MIAL did not  provide for its annual fees liability for the period from April 01, 2020 to September 30, 2022. On January 6,  2024, the Arbitral Tribunal has pronounced the award dated December 21, 2023 and declared that MIAL is  excused from making payment of Annual Fees to AAI from March 13, 2020 to February 28, 2022. 	 In April 2024, AAI has filed a petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 for  setting aside the award challenging certain aspects of the award. MIAL’s management is of the view that it  has a strong case in its favour to claim such relief basis legal assessment supported by its operational and  financial data upto March 31, 2023, But basis the re-evaluation of arbitration award, MIAL has decided to  seek relief from AAI only upto February 28, 2022 and accordingly has recognized annual fees as an expense  for the period of March 1, 2022 to September 30, 2022 of ` 627.37 crore (net of reversals). (b)	 During the previous year expenses of ` 71.67 crore incurred by the Parent Company in connection with the  further public offer (“FPO”) had been presented as an exceptional item.

Financial Instruments And Risk Review (a)	 Accounting Classification and Fair Value Hierarchy 	 Financial Assets and Liabilities : 	 The Group's principal financial assets include loans and trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents and other  receivables. The Group's principal financial liabilities comprise of borrowings, trade and other payables. The main  purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group's operations and projects. 	 Fair Value Hierarchy : 	 The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are  either observable or unobservable and consists of the following three levels: 	 Level-1 : Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 	 Level-2 : Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level-1 that are observable for the asset or liability,  either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). 	 Level-3 : Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in  whole or in part using a valuation model based on the assumptions that are neither supported by prices from  observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.

Financial Instruments And Risk Review (Contd.)  ===== PAGE 464 ===== Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 ADANI ENTERPRISES LIMITED 582 Integrated Annual Report 2023-24 	 A.	 Commodity Price Risk : 	 The Group’s performance is affected by the price volatility of commodities being traded (primarily coal and  also other materials) which are being sourced mainly from international markets. As the Group is engaged  in the on-going purchase or continuous sale of traded goods, it keeps close monitoring over its purchases  to optimise the price. Commodity prices are affected by demand and supply scenario in the international  market, currency exchange fluctuations and taxes levied in various countries. To mitigate price risk, the  Group effectively manages availability of coal as well as price volatility through widening its sourcing base,  appropriate combination of long term and short term contracts with its vendors and customers and well  planned procurement and inventory strategy. 	 B.	 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk : 	 Since the Group operates internationally and portion of the business transacted are carried out in more than  one currency, it is exposed to currency risks through its transactions in foreign currency or where assets or  liabilities are denominated in currency other than functional currency. 	 The Group evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from foreign currency transactions and follows  established risk management policies including the use of derivatives like foreign exchange forward and  option contracts to hedge exposure to foreign currency risks. 	 For open positions on outstanding foreign currency contracts and details on unhedged foreign currency  exposure, Refer Note 41. 	 Every percentage point depreciation / appreciation in the exchange rate between the Indian Rupee and the  U.S. Dollar, would have affected the Group's profit before tax for the year as follows : (` In crore) Particulars For the year ended  March 31, 2024 For the year ended  March 31, 2023 Impact on Consolidated profit before tax for the year 10.64 83.86 	 C.	 Interest Risk : 	 The Group is exposed to changes in interest rates due to its financing, investing and cash management  activities. The risks arising from interest rate movements arise from borrowings with variable interest rates.  The Group manages its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of fixed and variable rate loans  and borrowings. 	 The Group's risk management activities are subject to the management, direction and control of Central  Treasury Team of the Adani Group under the framework of Risk Management Policy for interest rate risk.  The Group’s central treasury team ensures appropriate financial risk governance framework through  appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in  accordance with the Group’s policies and risk objectives. 	 For Group's floating rate borrowings, the analysis is prepared assuming that the amount of the liability  outstanding at the end of the reporting period was outstanding for the whole year. A 50 basis point increase  or decrease is used, which represents management's assessment of the reasonably possible change  in interest rate.

Financial instruments that are subject to credit risk principally consist  of Loans, Trade and Other Receivables, Cash & Cash Equivalents, Investments and Other Financial Assets.  The carrying amounts of financial assets represent the maximum credit risk exposure. 	 Credit risk encompasses both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness  as well as concentration of risks. Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness  of counter parties on continuous basis with appropriate approval mechanism for sanction of credit limits.  Credit risk from balances with banks, financial institutions and investments is managed by the Group's  treasury team in accordance with the Company's risk management policy. Cash and cash equivalents and  Bank deposits are placed with banks having good reputation, good past track record and high quality credit  rating and also reviews their credit-worthiness on an on-going basis. 	 Since the Group has a fairly diversified portfolio of receivables in terms of spread, no concentration risk  is foreseen. A significant portion of the Group's receivables are due from public sector units (which are  government undertakings) and hence may not entail any credit risk.

The Group’s objective is to provide financial resources to meet its obligations  when they are due in a timely, cost effective and reliable manner and to manage its capital structure.  The Group monitors liquidity risk using cash flow forecasting models. These models consider the maturity of  its financial investments, committed funding and projected cash flows from operations. A balance between  continuity of funding and flexibility is maintained through continued support from trade creditors, lenders  and equity contributions. 	 The tables below provide details regarding contractual maturities of significant financial liabilities as at the  reporting date based on contractual undiscounted payments. 40.

MIAL’s management is of the view that it  has a strong case in its favour to claim such relief basis legal assessment supported by its operational and  financial data upto March 31, 2023, But basis the re-evaluation of arbitration award, MIAL has decided to  seek relief from AAI only upto February 28, 2022 and accordingly has recognized annual fees as an expense  for the period of March 1, 2022 to September 30, 2022 of ` 627.37 crore (net of reversals). m)	 During the year ended March 31, 2023, a short seller’s report (“SSR”) was published making certain  allegations against some of the Adani Group Companies (including the Company). In this regard, certain  writ petitions were filed with the Hon'ble Supreme Court (''SC'') seeking independent investigation of the  allegations in SSR. During the proceedings, SC observed that the Securities and Exchange Board of India  (''SEBI'') was investigating the matter. The SC also constituted an Expert Committee to investigate as well as   ===== PAGE 495 ===== Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2024 613 Strategic Review Corporate Overview Portfolio Overview ESG Overview Statutory Reports Financial Statements suggest measures to strengthen existing laws and regulations and also directed the SEBI to consider certain  additional aspects in its scope. The Expert Committee submitted its report dated May 6, 2023, finding no  regulatory failure in respect of applicable laws and regulations. The SEBI also concluded its investigations  in twenty-two of the twenty-four matters as per the status report dated August 25, 2023 to the SC. 	 On January 3, 2024, the SC disposed off all matters in various petitions including those relating to separate  independent investigations relating to the allegations in the SSR. Further, the SC directed SEBI to complete  the pending two investigations, preferably within three months, and take its investigations (including 22  already completed) to their logical conclusion in accordance with law. During the year ended March 31,  2024, the Company has received two show cause notices (SCNs) from the SEBI alleging non-compliance of  provisions of the Listing Agreement and LODR Regulations pertaining to related party transactions in respect  of certain transactions with third parties and validity of peer review certificates of statutory auditors with  respect to earlier years. The management believes that there is no material consequential effect of above  SCNs to relevant financial statements and no material non-compliance of applicable laws and regulations. 	 Earlier in April 2023, the Company had undertaken review of transactions referred in SSR through  an independent assessment by a law firm, which confirmed that (a) none of the alleged related parties  mentioned in the SSR were related parties to the Company or its subsidiaries, under applicable frameworks;  and (b) the Company is in compliance with the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. 	 Based on above independent assessment, the SC order and the fact that there are no pending regulatory or  adjudicatory proceedings as of date, except as mentioned above, the management concludes that there is  no material non-compliance of applicable laws and regulations and accordingly, these financial statements  do not carry any adjustments in this regard.

The valuation of which is inversely proportionate to  the interest rate movements. There is risk of volatility in asset values due to market  fluctuations and impairment of assets due to credit losses. Interest Risk: The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated using a discount  rate which is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting  period on Government securities. A decrease in yields will increase the fund liabilities  and vice-versa. Longevity Risk: The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated by reference to the best  estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment.  An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability. Salary Risk: The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated by reference to the future  salaries of plan participants.

The insurance Company, as part of the policy rules, makes payment of all gratuity outgoes happening  during the year (subject to sufficiency of funds under the policy). Any deficit in the policy assets are funded  by the such companies. The policy helps mitigate the liquidity risk. However, being a cash accumulation plan,  the duration of assets is shorter compared to the duration of liabilities. Thus, the companies are exposed to  movement in interest rate (in particular, the significant fall in interest rates, which should result in a increase  in liability without corresponding increase in the asset).

We have observed that following the announcement  of liberalisation in 1991, India has not just grown faster; it has compressed the GDP growth of the earlier  decades into considerably fewer years for equivalent growth. India is now expected to transition from a  sub-USD 3 Trillion economy to a USD 5 Trillion economy in the next few years. At Adani Group, we proactively invested in businesses that will ride the middle-income consumption  engine seeking improved life quality. We have invested not on the basis of what is, but on what can be. By  making disproportionate investments, we intend to shift the needle not just for the Company but for the  country as a whole - with the objective of extending access, reducing costs, widening the market and, in  doing so, helping strengthen India. Competitive advantage At the Adani Group, we believe  that the ability to make a  significant national contribution  can only be derived from  a broadbased competitive  advantage that is not dependent  on any one factor but is the result  of an overarching culture of  excellence – the coming together  of adjacent business presence,  rich sectorial experience, timely  project implementation, ability to  commission projects faster than  the sectorial curve, competence  to do so at a cost lower than the  industry average, foresight to not  merely service the market but  to grow it, establish a decisive  sustainable leadership and evolve  the Company’s position into a  generic name within the sector of  its presence. Relatively non-mature  spaces At the Adani Group, we have  selected to enter businesses that  may be considered ‘maturely non- mature’. Some of the businesses  can be classified as mature,  based on the enduring industry  presence and the conventional  interpretation of their market  potential; these very businesses  can be considered non-mature  by the virtue of their vast  addressable market potential  and the superior Adani Group  value proposition. The result is  that the Adani Group addresses  sectorial spaces not on the basis  of existing market demand but on  the basis of prospective market  growth following the superior  Adani sectorial value proposition. Outsized The Adani Group has established  a respect for taking outsized  bets in select sectors and  businesses without compromising  Balance Sheet safety. The Group  establishes a large capacity  aspiration that sends out a  strong message of its long-term  direction. Its outsized initial  capacity establishes economies  of scale within a relatively  short time horizon that deters  prospective competition and  generates a substantial cost  leadership (fixed and variable)  across market cycles. Technology The Adani Group invests in the  best technology standards of  the day that could generate  precious additional basis points in  profitability and help more than  recover the additional cost (if at  all) paid within a short tenure.  This superior technology standard  evolves into the Company’s  sustainable competitive  advantage, respect, talent  traction and profitability. Annual Report 2021-22 031 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 34 ===== Execution excellence The Adani Group has built a  distinctive specialisation in  project execution, one of the  most challenging segments in  India. The Group has established  benchmark credentials in  executing projects faster than  the sectorial average by drawing  from the multi-decade Adani pool  of managerial excellence across  a range of competencies. This  capability has resulted in quicker  revenue inflow, increased surplus  and competitive project cost per  unit of delivered output. Scalable financial structure The Adani Group has created  a robust financial foundation  of owned and borrowed funds  (the lowest cost by far for  infrastructure building companies  in India). This enhanced  credibility makes it possible for  the Adani Group to mobilise  resources from some of the  largest global lenders at among  the lowest costs. This approach  helps transform these marquee  institutions from mere lenders to  stable resource (fund or growth)  providers for the long-term. Ownership The Adani Group comprises a high  promoter ownership, validating  a commitment and ownership in  projects.

Resilience  comes from Belief. Belief is Optimism T o say our world is in  uncharted waters would  be an understatement.  The adverse impact of the mix  of the pandemic, armed conflict,  and climate change has exposed  the fragility of the global system.  The challenge of predicting  the increasing complexity of  this multidimensional crisis has  become evident to governments  across the world. Amplified  inflation, disrupted food supplies,  increased human displacement,  exposed healthcare machinery,  stalled education levels and  faltering job creation are all  signs of the damaging effects of  the crisis and are testing every  nation’s resilience. Resilience is a characteristic  that makes it possible to bounce  back. It is the ability to withstand  unanticipated crises; to face  uncertainty with curiosity and  optimism. This capacity within  societies to rebound from  setbacks is increasingly difficult  to model or predict as the crisis  drivers become more complex  and intermingled. While there is  always room for debate, looking  back to the recent events, there  can be no denying that India  has emerged with more credit  for its handling of the Covid-19  crisis from a humanitarian and  economic perspective than most  developed economies. When it  comes to Russia, India has been  able to take a mature approach  to the ongoing conflict. And in  this complicated environment,  India has emerged as the  fastest growing major economy  when other major nations are  confronted with recessionary  trends. India has also been one of  the very few countries that has  accelerated its renewable energy  footprint despite the energy crisis  that has seen several countries  pause their pursuit of renewable  energy goals. The government  must be given credit for the way  it has played its role and managed  this all-round balancing act. Adani Enterprises Limited 036 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 39 =====  ===== PAGE 40 ===== A culture of resilience It is India’s inherent resilience  that provides our nation with its  underlying optimism. My belief in  our nation has never been higher.  To use a cricketing analogy, we  are now playing in one of the  strongest home grounds and  on one of the firmest pitches  that has ever existed. This pitch  is expected to remain firm for  several decades. Optimism comes from resilience.  Resilience comes from belief. And  belief is optimism. In our case, it  is this resilience, optimism and  belief that drives us forward. Our  belief in our past defines our  ability to believe in our future,  translating into the big bets  that we make in the present.  Never have we shied away from  investing in India, never have  we slowed our investments, and  never have we feared to enter  any uncharted territories in  adjacent sectors – our resilience  comes from this unshakeable  belief and robust confidence in  the aspirations of our country  and countrymen. The success of  the Adani Group is based on its  alignment with the India growth  story. We have always strongly believed  in the policies announced by  the government, continued to  invest throughout all economic  cycles, watched for emerging  sectors critical for the country’s  growth, and entered new  sectors with confidence in our  learning and operating abilities  and more importantly, belief  in ourselves. We have grown  adjacency by adjacency without  getting hung up on conventional  business models. We have built  infrastructure envisioning a  far larger and greater India; a  confidence which has paid us  dividends. During this journey of more than  25 years, we have faced our share  of crises, stumbled a few times  but have always got back on our  feet and emerged stronger and  with a greater belief in ourselves.  It is these experiences and belief  in ourselves that have given us  our resilience and our optimism  for a greater future. It is this  future that unfolded over the  period 2021-22. This was the year  when we announced ourselves to  the world. Preparing to go ‘Green’ The best evidence to showcase  our confidence and belief in the  future is our investment of $70  billion in facilitating India’s green  transition. We are already one  of the world’s largest developers  of solar power. Our strength in  renewables will empower us  enormously in the effort to make  green hydrogen the fuel of the  future. We are leading the race  to turn India from a country that  is an over-reliant importer of oil  and gas, into a country that might  one day become a net exporter  of clean energy - a ‘never-done  before’ transformation in a  stunningly short period of time - a  transformation which will help  reshape India’s energy footprint in  an extraordinary way. Our belief in our past  defines our ability to  believe in our future,  translating into the  big bets that we make  in the present. Never  have we shied from  investing in India,  never have we slowed  our investments  and never have we  feared to enter any  uncharted territories  of adjacent sectors –  our resilience comes  from this unshakeable  belief and robust  confidence in  the aspirations of  our country and  countrymen. 45% EBITDA growth of AEL’s  incubator business Adani Enterprises Limited 038 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 41 ===== While we now hold a major global  renewable energy portfolio, we  have made remarkable progress  in several other industries. In  one stroke, we have become the  largest airport operator in India.  Around these airports that we  operate today, we are engaged  in the adjacent businesses of  building aerotropolises and  creating localised community- based economic centres. We  have made entries in sectors  ranging from data centres, super  apps and industrial clouds, to  defence and aerospace, to metals  and materials — all aligned with  the Government’s vision of an  Atmanirbhar Bharat. We continue to grow as builders  of India’s infrastructure, winning  some of the largest road  contracts in the nation and  growing our already substantial  market share in businesses such  as ports, logistics, transmission  and distribution, city gas and  piped natural gas. Our successful  IPO of Adani Wilmar makes us  the largest FMCG company in  the country. And now, we are  the second largest cement  manufacturer in India as well.  Our combined Group market  capitalization this year exceeded  US$ 200 billion. We were able to  raise billions of dollars from the  international markets – a direct  validation of confidence in both  the India and the Adani growth  story. Our growth and success  have been recognised around the  world. Foreign governments are  now approaching us to work in  their geographies and help build  their infrastructure. In 2022, we  also laid the foundation to seek a  broader expansion beyond India’s  boundaries. Our growth and  success have been  recognised around  the world.

Our focus on operational  excellence and accretive capacity  addition delivered across our  portfolio an EBITDA growth of  26%. Portfolio EBITDA stood at  INR 42,623 crores. This growth  was diversified and was reflected  across all our businesses with the  results speaking for themselves: Group Highlights 	§ Our utility portfolio grew 26%; 	§ Our transport and logistics  portfolio grew by 19%; 	§ Our FMCG portfolio grew by  34%; and 	§ Our incubator business,  represented by AEL, grew by 45%. The high growth of our incubator  AEL provides the Group with  a reliable foundation for the  continued development of new  businesses for yet another big  decade. AEL’s unique business  model has no parallel and we  intend to leverage this further. Segment Highlights AGEL: 	§ AGEL added 1,940 MW  operational capacity in FY22  (Green field commissioning: 200  MW, Inorganic addition: 1,740  MW) 	§ AGEL’s Solar CUF improved by  130 bps YoY to 23.8% and wind  CUF improves by 400 bps YoY to  30.8% in FY22 ATL: 	§ Adani Transmission Limited  (ATL) added 1,519 circuit km to its  network, reaching 18,795 circuit  km, and sold a record 7,972 million  units during the year.

While we may look back and  feel content, it is now that we  are gathering real momentum.  What we have been able to build  A crucial piece of  this jigsaw will be  a better-trained,  better-educated  and technologically  nimble workforce  with a belief that  they can achieve  their aspirations and  improve their quality  of life. I have no doubt  we will see this unfold  over the next decade.  Adani Enterprises Limited 040 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 43 ===== in two decades is India’s largest  integrated infrastructure business  based on a rapid extension into  adjacent businesses. This has  resulted in our transformation  into an integrated ‘platform of  platforms’ that combines energy  with logistics, moving us closer  to unprecedented access to the  Indian consumer. I today know  of no company that has this  business model and has potential  access to an unlimited B2B and  B2C market for the next several  decades. The milestone year It is here that I want to take a  moment to reflect on 2022 as  a year with special personal  meaning. It represents the  100th birth anniversary of my  inspiring father and role model  Shri Shantilal Adani, and my 60th  birthday. To mark this milestone,  the Adani family came together  and decided to contribute Rs.  60,000 crores towards charitable  activities related to healthcare,  education, and skill development,  focusing especially on rural India.  These three areas should be seen  holistically, rather than separately,  as they collectively form the  drivers for an equitable and  future-ready India. We have an  opportunity in India to decisively  lift tens of millions of people  permanently out of poverty.  We not only owe it to ourselves  but also to our country to do  everything we can to catalyse  this process. Our experience  in large project planning and  execution and the learnings  from the ongoing work done by  the Adani Foundation will help  us to uniquely accelerate and  implement these programmes in  the communities that need them  the most. The road ahead Getting back to the theme of  optimism as a driving force  for a society, Martin Seligman,  often referred to as the ‘father  of positive psychology’, wrote  in the Harvard Business Review  that he came to his insights  into the power of optimism ‘the  long, hard way, through many  years of research on failure  and helplessness.’ Essentially,  he discovered over several  years of studies, that resilient  people develop the courage  of interpreting setbacks as  temporary, local, and changeable.  A quote attributed to Winston  Churchill echoes Seligman’s  findings on resilience. “Success  is not final,” Churchill is supposed  to have said, “failure is not fatal:  it is the courage to continue that  counts.” The reason I am inspired by  these quotes is because I am an  incurable optimist. I have always  believed India is one the greatest  countries for an entrepreneur to  learn, develop and flourish. Today,  I see a real drive in the young  Indians to reclaim our economic  stature and gain back our position  as a pivotal force in global  affairs. Undoubtedly, the largest  middle class that will ever exist,  augmented by an increase in  the working age and consuming  population share, will have an  enormously positive impact on  India’s economic growth — an  outcome of our much-vaunted  demographic dividend. A crucial  piece of this jigsaw will be a  better-trained, better-educated,  and technologically nimble  workforce armed with the belief  that they can achieve their  aspirations and improve their  quality of life. I have no doubt we  will see this unfold over the next  decade. India, today, indeed is the world’s  firmest pitch on which to bat. Gautam Adani Chairman 26% Portfolio EBITDA growth,  FY 21-22 42,623 crore, portfolio EBITDA,  FY 21-22 H Annual Report 2021-22 041 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 44 ===== M A N A G I N G  D I R E C T O R ’ S  M E S S A G E At AEL, we have  positioned ourselves  as a responsible  incubator today for  the businesses of  tomorrow. A focused approach within the  Adani Group has resulted in AEL  emerging as the largest listed  incubator of futuristic businesses  that need patience and nurturing.  It has been our experience that  this responsible incubation has  helped our demerged companies  grow rapidly on listing, validating  the robustness of our incubation  process. The year FY 21-22 proved  to be one of reckoning for  AEL’s incubation journey and  preparation for the decade ahead.  Despite challenges in the external  environment – pandemic, war,  rising freight and low container  availability, AEL reported  attractive growth in its existing  businesses on the one hand and  investments in new developing  businesses on the other. The attractive growth was the  result of a prudent portfolio- based approach. This approach  comprised various businesses  and we recognise that during a  given period, there will be some  businesses that may do well and  some that may not. However, the  complementarity of businesses  has been designed to generate  positive returns irrespective of  the state of the markets and  also adequate cash from some  businesses to feed the capital  appetite of the others. In this  manner, it has become possible  to grow all the businesses within  our desired overall risk and capital  appetites. The highlight of the performance  of the Company during the  year under review was the  incorporation of a new subsidiary  Adani New Industries Limited.  This is one of the most exciting  developments at AEL as it will  address the generation of green  hydrogen, related downstream  products and the manufacturing  of wind turbines, batteries and  electrolysers. We believe that  these represent the businesses  of tomorrow, leading humankind  into a world that is cleaner and  ‘greener’. Adani New Industries will act as  a holding company of an end- to-end supply chain of frontier  energies and technologies  within AEL, addressing the  needs of India’s long-term energy  security. We believe that this  business, when seen from a  limited perspective, is a proactive  instance of initiative in a new and  exciting sector; when seen from a  larger perspective, we believe that  initiatives like these can help shift  India’s energy needle from imports  to captive generation that could  have downstream implications  on the country’s balance of  payments, currency strength and  competitiveness. Coming to our operational  performance during the year,  the Company’s solar modules  manufacturing ecosystem, which  Adani Enterprises Limited 042 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 45 ===== will be an integral part of Adani  New Industries, maintained a 1.1  GW volume despite headwinds of  rising input costs. The data center business in  Chennai is slated for completion  in the first half of FY 22-23;  the Company completed land  acquisition in other states for  data center projects, creating a  foundation of multi-locational  growth within a compressed  period. In the airports infrastructure  business, the Company completed  the acquisition of one of the  biggest airports in India, the  Mumbai airport, coupled with  the development rights of a  greenfield airport in Navi Mumbai.  The Company also took over the  airports of Jaipur, Guwahati and  Thiruvananthapuram during the  third quarter of FY 21-22. Following these acquisitions,  Adani Airports now serves every  fifth passenger in the country. We  believe that this represents an  achievement of pride considering  that the Company ventured  into this business only in 2019  and has since achieved sizable  scale, despite passing through  an extended phase when air  passenger throughput was absent  or affected. We are optimistic  that our airports network,  structured around a hub-and- spoke approach, will transform  the paradigm of the airports  business in India. Our roads portfolio grew to  5000+ lane km through 14  projects across 10 States during  FY 21-22. The Company’s business  was considerably strengthened  through a concession agreement  for the 464 km Ganga Expressway  Project in Uttar Pradesh, entailing  an investment of H171 billion.  We believe that the scale of this  project represents a validation  of the Company’s ability to win  large contracts. The project win  graduates it to the high table  within the sector and should  translate into attractive returns  given the related economies. The bids that had been won in the  past translated into projects and  some of them neared completion  – a successful demonstration of  competence across the entire  project lifecycle. The construction  of the road project at Bilaspur- Pathrapalli neared completion;  the Company intends to complete  two or three projects in FY  22-23. The Company was also  awarded the Bhagalpur Waste  Water Project under the Hybrid  Annuity Model in Bihar (as a part  of the under our Water business  portfolio). The Company’s commitment  towards successful incubation  and subsequent independence  was validated during the year  under review. The Company  completed a successful Initial  Public Offering of its joint venture  Adani Wilmar Ltd on the Indian  capital market. The issue was  received enthusiastically by  investors with 17x subscription.  The success of the offering  validated confidence in the Adani  Group. The issue finished the year  under review with a 125% gain  over its offer price, a validation  of the Company’s commitment to  reward investors. The Company also initiated  its digital journey following  the launch of Adani Digital  Labs, integrating all consumer  businesses around a single  platform. This platform is  expected to enhance synergies  across consumers of the Adani  Group portfolio companies. This  journey was reinforced with an  investment in digital and new-age  start-ups, including Cleartrip. As far as the conventional  businesses were concerned, the  Company’s Parsa East and Kente  Basan (PEKB) mine, the first and  only captive open cast coal mine  with washeries in the country,  continued to operate at a peak  capacity of 15 MMT per annum.  Apart from other operational  mines at Talabira II & III, Gare  Pelma III and Kurmitar, the  Company also initiated operations  at its Suliyari coal mine with a  peak capacity of 5 MMT. The sum of these performances is  that AEL reported a 75% increase  in consolidated Total Income  to H70,433 crore in FY 21-22;  consolidated EBIDTA increased  45% to H4,726 crore. A prudent  mix of established and developing  businesses will continue to deliver  strong numbers, protecting the  present and building investments  in the future. It would be relevant to  communicate that the Company  continued to play the role of a  responsible corporate citizen  during the year under review.  During the initial months of FY  21-22, the Company leveraged  its sourcing and logistic abilities  to procure oxygen plants and  concentrators as a part of its  Covid relief initiatives for public  welfare. The Company continued  to make a positive impact in  the fields of education, health,  sustainable livelihoods generation  and community infrastructure  development through Adani  Foundation. I must thank our stakeholders –  employees, lenders, shareholders,  government and society at  large – for their continued  support and license to operate,  which translated into smooth a  multi-business operation across  different regions. Mr. Rajesh S Adani Managing Director Annual Report 2021-22 043 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 46 ===== C H I E F  F I N A N C I A L  O F F I C E R ’ S  M E S S A G E Adani Enterprises  has been engaged  in the business of  shareholder value  creation for a quarter  of a century. During the year under review,  the Company validated its  commitment to enhance  shareholder value following  patient investments and  incubation. The Company’s  edible oils and food business,  carried out under Adani Wilmar  Limited, was listed on the stock  exchanges, generating a 125%  appreciation from its offer  price to its year closing price.  This incubation and listing  comprised the classic elements  of our incubation commitment:  the Company was nurtured for  more than two decades through  business-strengthening initiatives  that translated into the creation  of enduing brands and market  leadership. The result is that  Adani Wilmar is one of the fastest  growing large foods companies in  India and the undisputed leader  of the Indian edible oils market. The success of the Adani Wilmar  IPO represents yet another  instance in a growing line of  post-listing successes of AEL- incubated companies. At AEL, we  believe that the robustness of our  incubation is not only reflected  in the growth of that business  while it is being incubated; it is  also reflected following listing.  The result is that the listing of  Adani Ports, Adani Transmission,  Adani Green Energy and Adani  Total Gas delivered returns at  a consolidated CAGR of 37% to  shareholders, considerably higher  than the broad stock market  indices. At AEL, our portfolio comprises  maturing and nascent businesses.  During the year under review,  AEL strengthened its incubation  pipeline through the addition of  the futuristic business of Adani  New Industries, while continuing  to strengthen its Airports, Roads  and Data Center businesses.  The last three business achieved  rapid scale within a compressed  period, considerably faster than  the sectors that they represent.  They service large addressable  markets and given adequate  support – strategic, financial and  managerial – these businesses  are expected to grow with  speed towards visible scale and  performance. In a portfolio of businesses  influenced by diverse market  pulls and pressures, the  over-riding validation of our  strategic direction is our capital  management. At AEL, capital  management is our capacity to  feed cash flows from a business  for its own sustainable growth  while addressing the short-term  needs of other businesses. The  effectiveness of the capital  Adani Enterprises Limited 044 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 47 ===== management plan was validated  by the Company’s credit rating  during the year under review:  upgraded to A+ for long-term  debt and to A1+ (highest rating)  for short-term credit facilities  by CARE Ratings. We believe  that the ability to enhance  credit rating during one of the  most challenging phases in the  country’s social and economic  existence is a testimony to the  Company’s nation-led and future- driven businesses. Following 2022, in a post-Balance  Sheet date development, AEL  strengthened its net worth  through a primary preferential  equity issuance of USD 1  billion to International Holding  Company, Abu Dhabi. This fund  raising showcases confidence of  global marquee investors in the  country’s long-term stability and  prospects in general, and AEL’s  business plan in particular. AEL’s Consolidated Total Income  for FY 21-22 increased 75% to  H70,433 crore, Consolidated  EBIDTA increased 45% to  H4,726 crore and Consolidated  attributable PAT was H777 crore.  The Company’s earnings per  share was H7.06 per share and  the Company proposed a final  dividend Re.1 per share for the  year. Even as a number of AEL’s  businesses are still in the  developing phase, they have  begun to contribute to EBITDA.  The Company’s Airports and  Roads business began to  generate a healthy EBITDA during  FY 21-22, validating the strength  of the AEL incubation story,  drawn from the scale and the  Adani Group synergy leading to a  short gestation towards maturity.  These relatively young businesses  contributed an EBITDA of H1,304  crore during FY 21-22 and should  grow attractively as our Airports  operations normalise following  increased passenger movement  starting the current financial  year and a ramp up in our Roads  portfolio. The EBITDA from our established  businesses sustained their robust  momentum, increasing 13% to  H3,664 crore, while attributable  PAT rose 74% to H2,038 crore. One of the achievements of  the Company was the financial  closure for its greenfield Navi  Mumbai International Airport  project. The Company arranged  for the entire debt of H12,770  crore from State Bank of India,  taking Mumbai a step closer  to the launch of another  infrastructure landmark. The credible feature of the  Company’s operations was  that significant investments  in new growth businesses did  not compromise its financial  discipline. The Company’s debt- to-equity ratio and interest  coverage ratio stood at 1.5x and  1.9x respectively, highlighting  sound capital management  practices. During the year under review,  the Company strengthened its  governance architecture and  assurance practices through the  creation of an Audit Committee  and Nomination & Remuneration  Committee (100% independent).  The Company also formed  a Corporate Responsibility  Committee comprising 100%  Independent Directors with  the objective to provide an ESG  roadmap and assurance to the  Board. AEL also overhauled its  Board-level review mechanism to  moderate risk. The principal message that one  seeks to send out is that AEL is  poised to embark on an exciting  journey with investments in the  futuristic energy value chain,  airports, roads, data center  and materials like copper and  petrochemicals. We believe that  these businesses represent the  building blocks of the India of the  next 25 years leading to 2047 –  the first centenary of this nation  – and we are optimistic that as  these businesses grow, they will  enhance considerable value for  our shareholders as well. Jugeshinder Singh Chief Financial Officer The credible  feature of the  Company’s  operations was  that significant  investments in new  growth businesses  did not compromise  its financial  discipline.

The theme of this year’s report is ‘Incubating for India’. As a concept, incubation  is becoming increasingly  relevant. The concept is not only  relevant for technology  companies; it is now  accepted as critical for all  companies. Successful incubation can  make or break companies  within the first few years of  being launched. The inability to incubate  successfully can result in an  extensive loss of national  resources. Incubation is increasingly  relevant due to the nature of  variables, Black Swans and  competitive pressures. When businesses are small,  they need to be protected  and supported by existing  businesses. They need to be sustained  by a strong Balance Sheet,  managerial bandwidth,  relationship networks and  institutionalised knowledge. They need to be spun off into  standalone status only when  they achieve self-reliance. Annual Report 2021-22 057 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 60 ===== The most critical words  in our commitment to  incubation: ‘Of India,  by India and for India’ Overview Adani Enterprises Limited is more than a company; it is a snapshot of the  world as it is likely to be in the future. A world that will gravitate  towards food hygiene. A world that will invest more  extensively in efficient and  convenient mass mobility. A world that will seek to invest  in energy-efficient resources. A world where companies will  need to build national internet  infrastructure. Adani Enterprises has seeded  today’s space with related  businesses that will be  increasingly relevant in tomorrow’s  world. The Company has brought to  these businesses a largeness of  vision, coupled with aggressive  business implementation and  patient capital. These businesses represent more  than a commercial or arbitrage  proposition; they represent a  superior proxy of a better lifestyle,  cleaner world and better hygienic  proposition. Most of these businesses  represent a showcase of how  humankind would want to live  across the foreseeable future. The result is that these businesses  hold out a growing bias for  consumption today and tomorrow,  the basis of business continuity. This assurance of being among the  first-movers in business today with  the prospect of a considerably  larger and more competitive  business tomorrow represents  the underlying optimism at Adani  Enterprises. Marked by the prospect  of enhancing value for all  stakeholders associated with the  Company. Adani Enterprises Limited 058 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 61 ===== Adani Enterprises, in its capacity  of a focused incubator, is unlike  any listed company in India. We have created an entire  company around the incubation  theme, which is unlike any listed  company in the country. We have focused exclusively on  incubation for more than two and  a half decades in a rapidly growing  post-liberalisation India. We combine the roles of venture  capitalist, private equity investor  and consultant. We provide Adani Group with the  courage to venture into new and  uncharted areas. We invest with the foresight that  our business will plug national  gaps a few years down the road. We bring a responsible patience  to our commitment – as opposed  to being pressured into short- term decisions by the debt on our  books. We are incubating businesses with  the aspiration to create industry  leaders and sectorial transformers. We leverage the power of deep  pockets, multi-year patience,  Group knowledge, visibility to  recruit talent and availability of  adequate capital. We provide our incubating  companies the shock absorbers to  ride out challenging market cycles  and sectorial shakeout. We have demonstrated the  courage to make outsized  investments at the outset,  transforming what would have  been a beginner’s handicap into a  competitive advantage. We have successfully reconciled  the soul of a start-up with the  competitiveness of a mature  organisation – a rare foundation  around which to build a modern  business. We have responded with a  portfolio approach - collection  of businesses – that enhances  business sustainability. We grow our business through  strategic business units,  accountable to the Board of  Directors for their sustainable  growth. We work with the objective to  create robust businesses that  strengthen profitability within our  system and enhance shareholder  when demerged.

Annual Report 2021-22 061 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 64 ===== A D A N I  A N D  T H E  I N D I A  S T O R Y Adani Enterprises is invested  in a story called India If India grows, Adani Enterprises grows faster Economic growth The GDP growth achieved by the  country in the first 60 years was  replicated and compressed in only  the next seven. We believe that  India will return to an aggressive  growth phase from the current  year onwards with the pandemic  behind it. Demographic advantage India is not just adding most  people to its population each  year; India’s average age at 29 is  also younger than the comparable  average age in China (38) and  USA (38). This indicates that  India’s youth will be economically  active far longer, a robust  foundation on which to build a  consumption-driven economy Catch up Our optimism is derived from  the reality that there are two  consumption curves transpiring  concurrently in India – one is the  catch-up curve where an under- consumed India (across virtually  every product or commodity)  that is lower than the global  average plays catch-up in the  first phase. There is a second  curve where the per capita  consumption average is aligned  with the economic growth of  that year. When you put these  consumption drivers together you  get a sustainable consumption  appetite for the long-term, the  scale of which if which is perhaps  unmatched anywhere. Aspiration The modern Indian is different  from his or her predecessor.  The modern Indian seeks to  live better, consume more, less  price-sensitive, open to buying  on credit, influenced by the  smartphone and more globally  exposed to trends than ever.  The result is that we foresee a  progressive decline in savings  and an increase in spending. Why  this is important is because this  is transpiring across the second  largest population spread of the  world, creating an unprecedented  economic transformation  opportunity. Government policy The principal driver of economic  change is top-down. The Indian  government has unleashed an  unprecedented complement  of economic reforms, providing  the country with a long-term  direction. The core of this  direction has been centred  around the concept of self- reliance - Atmanirbhar Bharat -  that ensures that India produces  much of her needs within and  uses the critical mass to service  the needs of other countries.  Besides, the Indian government  announced the production-linked  incentive scheme, catalysing  capital expenditure across a  range of large industries. We are  optimistic that these policies will  give the country a decisive push  towards manufacturing-driven  growth, accelerating the creation  of jobs, incomes and prosperity. Privatisation The last two Union Budgets  have underscored the need for  the monetisation of national  economic assets through  responsible privatisation. A  significant privatisation that  occurred during the last financial  year was that of India’;s national  carrier Air India. We foresee this  trend extending to other assets  and sectors, attracting private  sector capital and enterprise that  could result in enhanced national  productivity. We also perceive the  government’s monetisation plan  to be a decisive economic trigger. India and Adani Enterprises At Adani Enterprise, we believe  that we have a growing stake  in the emerging India story.  We are not just a collection of  a few businesses (as on 31st  March 2022), but we are also  the country’s largest organised  listed business incubator that is  focused on building for India, by  India and in India. The principal message that we  wish to communicate is that if  India grows quicker than it has  done in the past and higher than  the global economic growth, then  Adani Enterprises is likely to climb  into the next orbit. Adani Enterprises Limited 062 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 65 ===== The businesses of Adani  Enterprises have been threaded  around a singular idea: invest  today in what India will need  tomorrow.

Adani Enterprises has graduated  from the promotion of one  business (ports) into a collection  At Adani Enterprises, the  businesses of our constituent  companies are woven around  overarching Adani Group themes,  which enhance strategic synergy,  direction and outcomes. The incubation pedigree of Adani  Enterprises has been influenced  by the following realities: Structure: Adani Enterprises  operates like a holding company;  it owns complete or significant  equity stakes in its constituent  businesses Accountability: Each AEL  business vertical or constituent  company is headed by a Chief  Executive Officer who reports  periodically to the Chairman and  the Company’s Board of Directors  on business growth, profitability,  challenges and opportunities Financial support: The Company  provides critical cash flow support  during the initial phase of the  capital expenditure period, which  makes it possible to moderate  of several businesses (including  demerged) that have been grown  completely from scratch.

The constituent  business enjoy access to Adani  Group competencies that infuse  institutionalised competencies  into the new businesses without  each of these companies needing  to reinvent any wheel, making it  possible to leapfrog capabilities  and time Verticalisation: The Company has  been structured across distinctive  verticals that operate mutually  or perhaps in any listed company  anywhere in the world. These  businesses possess a complement  of scale, strategic importance and  technology sophistication. Ownership: The Adani Group  comprises a high promoter  ownership, enhancing the  confidence of other stakeholders. exclusive of each other. In turn,  this verticalisation enhances  focus, accountability and  specialisation. Partnership: The AEL corporate  team plays the role of a strategic  advisor to each of the Company’s  businesses, which ensures that  the Adani Group management  bandwidth is always available to  assist, support and nurture the  businesses Governance: The constituent  businesses get an immediate  access to an operating framework  (strategic/tactical/controls/ reporting) that makes it possible  to capitalise on and build on an  available governance foundation Overview Our Group priorities Process efficiency Adani Enterprises Limited 066 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 69 ===== Futuristic: We invest in business  likely to be futuristic or at least  likely to remain relevant for the  next few decades. Wherever the  sector is likely to be phased down  due to an overarching global  direction away from that product  or service, we cap investments in  that business. Competitive advantage: We have  invested in an overarching culture  of excellence – rich sectorial  experience, timely project  implementation, commission  projects faster than norm,  commission assets lower than the  industry average, grow markets,  establish leadership and evolve  into a generic name. Nascent spaces: We have  selected to enter ‘mature non- mature’ business spaces –  ‘mature’ based on a conventional  interpretation of their potential  and ‘non-mature’ based on their  vast emerging addressable  market and the Adani Group value  proposition. Outsized: We take outsized  bets in select sectors, which  sends out a strong message of  our long-term seriousness. The  disproportionate initial capacity  would have been a drag in a  conventional structure; it is  an advantage in an incubated  structure that establishes  economies of scale immediately  and deters prospective  competition. Execution excellence: We possess  a culture of specialisation in  projects execution, one of the  most challenging segments in  India, marked by the ability to  execute projects faster than the  sectorial average by drawing on a  validated Group level managerial  excellence. Technology: We invest in cutting- edge technology standards that  generate incremental profitability,  helping recover any additional  cost that might have been  paid. This superior technology  pedigree effectively becomes a  potent driver of the Company’s  competitive advantage,  positioning the Company around  a technology-driven recall even  as it may be present in relatively  conventional sectors. Scalable financial structure: We  have created a robust financial  foundation of owned and  borrowed funds (the lowest cost  by far for infrastructure building  companies in India), empowering  mobilisation from some of the  largest global lenders at the  lowest costs for the longest  tenures (quasi equity). The quality of AEL’s incubation  has been reflected in the speed  of maturing of its various  businesses. This has helped  mature the demerged entity so  that it emerges as a sectorial  benchmark with a credible  credit rating that leads to the  maximisation of stakeholder  value. This demonstrates that the  AEL influence is not restricted to  the incubation period but extends  beyond, helping create sectorial  leaders.

We are engaged in business  for the benefit of all our  stakeholders: the customer must  benefit through an enhanced  product or service, the employee  must derive pride, remuneration  and career growth, the investor  must generate a superior  return on employed capital  over competing investment  alternatives, the community must  benefit from our presence, the  government must benefit through  taxes and livelihood creation  while our vendors must benefit  through the outsourcing of  products and services. This commitment to the creation  of integrated value for all our  stakeholders represents the basis  of our long-term existence. It  reflects in enhanced Financial  capital, Manufactured capital,  Human capital, Intellectual  capital, Social and relationship  capital and Natural capital. The environment component  addresses the world’s priority  that businesses consume  environmentally responsible  resources, consume an optimal  quantum, recycle waste, consume  a modest quantum of finite fossil  fuels and build resistance to  climate change, moderating the  carbon footprint. The social component addresses  the need to invest in employees,  vendor/customer relationships  and community welfare. The governance component  enunciates strategic clarity,  prioritises values cum conduct  codes, selects a prudent Board of  Directors and indicates alignment  with UNGC principles, evoking a  responsible expectation across  stakeholders. The combination – environment,  social and governance – provides  a platform for long-term growth. Some of the principles of our ESG  commitment have been described  in this section, which provide a  perspective of who we are, where  we come from and what we hold  dear. Overview At AEL, we run businesses that  operate around a high sense  of discipline when it comes to  compliances, documentation,  reporting and transparency on  the one hand and operating  standards on the other, the basis  of sustained outperformance. Discipline At AEL, we have centralised the  importance of integrity in our  operations. We place the highest  standards when it comes to  personal and collective integrity,  reflected in a compliance with  the enunciated standards  stipulated by the government,  other regulatory agencies and  peer global standards. Over  the years, our commitment to  integrity has also extended to  gender respect, zero tolerance for  sexual harassment, impatience  with ethical transgressions,  commitment to recruit without  prejudice and appraise without  partialness, respect for the dignity  of people and environment  integrity and respect for the laws  of the lands of our presence. Integrity Adani Enterprises Limited 068 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 71 ===== At AEL, we believe that the  success of our strategic direction  is influenced by our Board of  Directors. Our Directors represent  the strategic ‘pilots’ of our  direction, helping the Company  accelerate or course-correct. We  have placed a premium on our  Board composition, comprising  achievers of standing. The Board  comprises a good proportion of  Independent Directors, who can  speak their mind and influence  the Board. At the core of our sustainability  lies our ESG (environment-social- governance) commitment. This  commitment has been formalised  through a policy; besides, this  ethic is not just documented  but is lived. Over the years,  this commitment has reflected  in pro-active investments in  equipment, certifications,  people and initiatives directed to  moderate the Company’s carbon  footprint. The Company’s social  commitment has been reflected  in various initiatives to enhance  value for employees, vendors,  customers and community.  The Company’s governance  commitment comprises an  enunciation of how it intends to  do business. ESG commitment At AEL, we are present in diverse  businesses that enrich the  holistic value of our portfolio.  Over the years, this diversity  has strengthened our ability  to withstand specific sectorial  headwinds. Besides, our ability to  cross-support other businesses  has enhanced our corporate  sustainability. Plural focus At AEL, we believe that growth  can be best derived when the  promoter charts out a strategic  direction, remains engaged in  the business at the strategic  level but delegates day-to-day  management to professionals.  This arrangement has been  catalysed by an investment in  processes and systems, a scalable  foundation that will enable the  Company to grow profitably  and sustainably. A framework  of checks and balances makes  our de-risking effective. As an  extension, our audit-driven and  compliance-driven approach  enhances the credibility of our  reported numbers. Process-driven Board of Directors At AEL, we plan for the long-term.  Our investments are not inspired  by considerations of short-term  arbitrage but by the sustainable  long-term value we can generate.  This is visible in the verticals of  our presence: some of the spaces  can be considered relatively  nascent; we believe that as the  lifestyle revolution widens and  the consumption market grows,  our businesses will progressively  mature, deepening our relevance. Long-term At AEL, we believe that business  sustainability is best derived  from achieving a balance  between aggressive growth  that threatens the safety of the  Balance Sheet and conservative  growth that leads to sectorial  under-performance. The result  is that each of our business  constituents has defined their  respective growth appetites  without impairing the overall  Balance Sheet. The Company has  consciously allocated accruals  into business growth without  stretching the Balance Sheet. The  result is that we have remained  liquid and profitable through  market cycles.

National Green Hydrogen  Policy: The government of India  notified the National Green  Hydrogen Policy to achieve a  production of 5 million tonnes  of green hydrogen by 2030. The  government announced measures  to promote the use of green  hydrogen through lower emission  incentives, comprising a waiver of  interstate transmission charges  for 25 years to the manufacturers  of green hydrogen and green  ammonia. This waiver would apply  for projects commissioned before  30th June 2025. National Green Hydrogen  Mission: The Union Government  plans to launch a comprehensive  green hydrogen mission to take  the Green Hydrogen Policy  ahead; this was announced in  February 2022. The mission  is expected to infuse green  hydrogen purchase / consumption  obligation (GHCO) in fertiliser  production and petroleum  refining, akin to the renewable  purchase obligation (RPO). The  mission is also expected to  list the sectors that will need  to start using green hydrogen  voluntarily with a mandatory  roadmap for the fertiliser and  petrochemical sectors. Under  the mission, the government is  expected to launch incentive  schemes, including a capex  incentive and PLI scheme for the  manufacture of electrolysers. The  mission is expected to propose  GHCO for 30% substitution of  green hydrogen in the refinery  and fertiliser sectors by FY30  and CGD for 10% blending of  green hydrogen by FY30. The  mission is expected to propose  15% grey ammonia substitution  (domestic + import) with green  ammonia in existing plants by FY  25-26 and 30% substitution by  FY 29-30 as per GHCO mandate.  The Government is expected to  waive transmission and wheeling  charges for green H2 and green  ammonia projects. Guidelines  are expected to be announced  for green ammonia export to  capitalise on low renewable  energy tariffs. The government intends to  provide a single portal for all  clearances required for setting  up green hydrogen production  along with a facility for producers  to bank any surplus renewable  energy generated with discoms  for up to 30 days and use it as  required.

India is not just playing a side role  in the global renewable energy  transformation; it is playing  a front-line role in altering its  reality within the country and  enhancing its respect in the  global community of nations.  The result is an unprecedented  growth headroom for companies  in the sectorial value chain,  whether they be engaged in  manufacturing renewable energy  products or generating clean  power. The scope resident within  the sector is reflected in the  following details: India ranked  third in Renewable Energy  Country Attractive Index in 2021.  India set an ambitious target to  achieve a capacity of 175 GW  of renewable energy by the end  of 2022 and 500 GW by 2030,  arguably the largest renewable  energy expansion programme  undertaken by any country. This enunciated policy translated  into positive ground realities.  About 63 GW of India’s renewable  energy capacity is under various  construction phases; installed  power capacity from non-fossil  fuels is expected to rise to 66%  of the overall national power  generation capacity by 2030.  In line with this projected  transformation, India’s renewable  energy generation capacity  addition in FY 22-23 was  estimated at 16 gigawatt (GW), its  highest annual increment. There is a basis for the national  optimism: as on 31st March 2022,  India’s cumulative renewable  energy generation capacity  (including hydro) stood at 150  GW and likely to accelerate from  this point for a good reason. Due  to India’s favourable location in  the solar belt (400 S to 400 N),  at is one of the best solar energy  recipients, marked by abundant  sunlight availability. This is how the picture is  expected to strengthen:  according to the government’s  vision document, coal-based  power is expected to account for  just 33% of the country’s total  installed 817 GW capacity in  2030, (presently, 53% of 393 GW  installed capacity) and a mere  10.5% in 2047. This projection  is aligned with Prime Minister  Narendra Modi’s net-zero  commitment to make India self- sustaining in its energy needs by  Solar manufacturing Annual Report 2021-22 077 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 80 ===== the 100th year of independence  and increase the share of  renewable energy from 22% to  67% by 2047. Of the 1,325 GW  projected installed capacity by  2047, 1,125 GW is expected to be  derived from renewable energy,  140 GW from coal, 10 GW from  gas and nuclear power generation  capacity from 7 GW to 50 GW. This provides an optimistic  encapsulation of where India  is and where it intends to go:  the fifth largest country in the  world in terms of solar rooftop  installations and one of the  fastest growing in terms of overall  renewable energy capacity  addition.

Because of this, copper demand  has grown in line with global  economic growth, making the  metal a reliable commodity with  which to track long-term business  cycles. It would be reasonable  to communicate that copper  represents the building block of  the modern world, a fair proxy of  economic growth and prosperity. On account of its properties,  singularly or in combination,  of high ductility, malleability,  and thermal and electrical  conductivity as well as its  resistance to corrosion, copper  has become a major industrial  metal (ranking third after iron and  aluminum by quantity consumed).  The major copper applications  comprise electrical wires (60%),  roofing and plumbing (20%) and  industrial machinery (15%). Adani Enterprises Limited 124 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 127 ===== Copper is used in building  construction, power generation  and transmission, electronic  product manufacturing, and  the production of industrial  machinery and transportation  vehicles. Copper wiring and  plumbing are integral to  appliances, heating or cooling  systems and telecommunications  links. Copper is an essential  component in the motors, wiring,  radiators, connectors, brakes and  bearings used in cars and trucks.  The average car contains 1.5  kilometers (0.9 mile) of copper  wire, and the total amount of  copper ranges from 20 kilograms  (44 pounds) in small cars to  45 kilograms (99 pounds) in  luxury and hybrid vehicles.

About 80% of  India’s petrochemicals capacity  is integrated with petroleum  refineries, an edge in terms  of petrochemical feedstock  certainty. markets. Within this volatility, India’s  petrochemical sector emerged  as a growth avenue. With a  significant import dependence  and high-demand growth, India  has emerged as one of the  most attractive markets for new  petrochemical investments. With  demand growth estimated at  around 8% CAGR over 15 years,  India could contribute to more  than 10% of incremental global  petrochemicals growth over the  decade and could need more than  15 world-scale petrochemicals  assets by 2035 to address  domestic demand. Market access: The current  per capita consumption of  chemicals in India is low (1/10th  of the world’s average). A large  population base, increasing per  capita income and rising demand  from end-use sectors make India  an attractive market. Capital cost: India offers a  competitive cost of infrastructure  fabrication compared to other  countries due to the presence of  a large fabrication market, low  cost of labour and a favourable  location. Operating cost: The availability  of competent and low-cost  labour coupled with affordable  electricity rates has helped  keep the operating cost of  petrochemical plants competitive.

The global economy was affected by prohibitive  shipping freight rates, a shortage of shipping  containers  and  semi-conductor  chips  in  2021.  Inflation was at its highest since 2011, especially in  the advanced economies, catalysed by a run up in  commodity prices. Some emerging and developing  economies were positioned to withdraw policy support  to contain inflation even as the economic recovery was  still incomplete. The global economy is projected to grow at a modest  2.6% in 2022 following the Russia-Ukraine war.   A higher interest rate environment could affect  emerging markets and developing economies with  large foreign currency borrowings and external  financing needs in 2022.

(Source: World Bank, IMF, Business Standard, Times of  India) Indian economic review The Indian economy reported an attractive recovery in  FY 22, its GDP rebounding from a de-growth of 7.3 per  cent in FY 21 to a an estimated growth of 8.7 per cent  in FY 22. By the close of FY 22, India was among the  six largest global economies, its economic growth rate  was the fastest among major economies (save China),  its market size at around 1.40 billion the second most  populous in the world and its rural under-consumed  population arguably the largest in the world.   Y-o-Y growth of the Indian economy Regional growth % FY19  FY20   FY21   FY22   Real GDP growth (%)    6.1     4.2    (7.3)    8.7 Growth of the Indian economy, FY 22    Regional growth % Q1,  FY22  Q2,  FY22  Q3  FY22  Q4,  FY22  Real GDP growth (%)    20.1    8.4    5.4     4.1   ===== PAGE 158 ===== 156 Adani Enterprises Limited CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Indian economy was affected by the second wave of  the pandemic that affected economic growth towards  the fag end of the previous financial year and across  the first quarter of the financial year under review. The  result is that after a growth of 1.6 per cent in the last  quarter of FY 21, the Indian economy grew 20.1 per  cent in the first quarter of FY 22 due to the relatively  small economic base during the corresponding period  of the previous year. India’s monsoon was abundant in 2021 as the country  received 99.32% of a normal monsoon, lower though  than in the previous year. The estimated production  of rice and pulses was of 127.93 million tonnes and  26.96 million tonnes respectively. The total oilseeds  production of the country recorded a volume of 371.47  million tonnes. Moreover, based on the spatial and  temporal distribution of the 2021 monsoon rainfall,  the agricultural gross value added (GVA) growth in  FY22 wasanticipated to be 3-3.5%. The country’s  manufacturing sector grew an estimated 12.5 per  cent, the agriculture sector 3.9 per cent, mining  and quarrying by 14.3%, construction by 10.7% and  electricity, gas and water supply by 8.5% in FY 2021-22. There were positive features of the Indian economy  during the year under review. India got the highest annual FDI inflow of USD 83.57  billion in FY2021-22, a validation of the global investing  confidence in India’s growth story. The Government  approved 100% FDI for insurance intermediaries and  increased FDI limit in the insurance sector from 49% to  74% in the Union Budget 2021-22. India surpassed the H88,000 Crore target set for asset  monetisation in FY 22, raising over H97,000 Crore with  roads, power, coal, mining and minerals accounting for  a large chunk of the transactions. The Indian Government launched a four-year H6 lakh  Crore asset monetisation plan (roads and highways,  pipelines, power transmission lines, telecom towers,  railways station re-development, private trains, tracks,  goods sheds, dedicated freight corridor, railways  stadiums, airports, projects in major ports, coal mining  projects, mineral mining blocks, national stadia,  redevelopment of colonies and hospitality assets). In 2021, India was the largest recipient of global  remittances. The country received USD 87 billion  during 2021, with the US being the largest source  (20%). India’s foreign exchange reserves stood at an  all-time high of USD 642.45 billion as on September  3, 2021, crossing USD 600 billion in forex reserves for  the first time. India’s currency weakened 3.59% from H73.28 to H75.91  to a US dollar through FY 22. The consumer price index  (CPI) of India stood at an estimated 5.3% in FY 2021- 22. India reported improving Goods and Services Tax  (GST) collections month-on-month in the second half  of 2021-22 following the relaxation of the lockdown,  validating the consumption-driven improvement in the  economy. The country recorded its all-time highest GST  collections in March 2022 at H1.42 lakh Crore, which  was 15% higher than the corresponding period in 2021. India ranked 62 in the 2020 World Bank’s Ease of Doing  Business ranking. The country received positive FPIs  worth H51,000 Crore in 2021 as the country ranked  fifth among the world’s top leading stock markets with  a market capitalisation of $3.21 trillion in March 2022. The fiscal deficit was estimated at ~H15.91 trillion for  the year ending 31st March, 2022 on account of a higher  Government expenditure during the year under review. India’s per capita income was estimated to have  increased 16.28% from H1.29 lakh in 2020-21 to H1.50  lakh in 2021-22 following a relaxation in lockdowns and  increased vaccine rollout. India’s tax collections increased to a record H27.07 lakh  Crore in FY 2021-22 compared with a Budget estimate  of H22.17 lakh Crore. While direct taxes increased 49  per cent, indirect tax collections increased 30 per cent.  The tax-to-GDP ratio increased from 10.3 per cent in  FY21 to 11.7 per cent in FY22, the highest since 1999. Retail inflation in March at 6.95 per cent was above  the RBI’s tolerance level of 6 per cent but fuel prices  played no part in this surge. Retail inflation spiked to a  17-month high in March 2022, above the upper limit of  the RBI’s tolerance band for the third straight month.

The Government is emphasizing the role of  PM Gati Shakti, Inclusive Development, Productivity  Enhancement & Investment, Sunrise Opportunities,  Energy Transition, Climate Action, and as Financing of  Investments. The capital expenditure target of the Indian Government  expanded by 35.4% from H5.54 lakh Crore to H7.50 lakh  Crore. The effective capital expenditure for FY23 was  seen at H10.7 lakh Crore. An outlay of H5.25 lakh Crore  was made to the Ministry of Defence, 13.31% of the  total Budget outlay. A boost was provided to India’s  electric vehicle policy ‘Scheme for Faster Adoption and  Manufacturing of (Hybrid and) Electric Vehicle in India’.  An announcement of nearly H20,000 Crore was made  for the PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan to catalyse  the infrastructure sector. An expansion of 25,000 km   ===== PAGE 159 ===== 157 Annual Report 2021-22 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS was initiated in 2022-23 for the national highways  network. To boost the agricultural sector, an allocation  of H2.37 lakh Crore was made towards the procurement  of wheat and paddy under MSP operations. An outlay  of H1.97 lakh Crore was announced for the Production  Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes across 13 sectors.  Outlook India’s medium-term optimism is derived from the fact  that three down cycles – long-term, medium-term  and short-term – could well be reversing at the same  time. The long-term downtrend, as a result of non- performing assets, scams and overcapacity could be  over; the medium-term downtrend that was caused by  the ILFS crisis, select banks collapse and weakening  NBFCs could well be over; the short-term downtrend  on account of the pandemic has weakened following  the acceleration of the vaccine rollout. There is a possibility of each of these downtrends  having played out, which could well lead to a multi-year  revival in capital investments. Some USD 500 billion  worth of investments are expected to be made in the  wind and solar infrastructure, energy storage and grid  expansion. The Indian economy is projected to grow by 8% in  FY23 (World Bank estimate), buoyed by tailwinds of  consistent agricultural performance, flattening of the  COVID-19 infection curve, increase in Government  spending, favourable reforms and an efficient roll-out  of the vaccine leading to a revival in economic activity. Across the next three years, capital expenditure in  core sectors - cement, metal, oil refining and power -  should be about H5 trillion. Besides, the Government’s  production linked incentives (PLI)–led capex should  generate an incremental H1.4 trillion in sectors like  consumer durables, pharmaceuticals and automobiles. Industry overview Coal business: India is the second-largest coal producer  and ranks fourth in terms of coal reserves in the  world, emphasizing the country’s capacity to provide  adequate coal and address its needs for industrial  development. India produced about 777.26 million tons  of coal in FY 22 compared to 716.08 million tonnes  in FY 21, an increase of 8.54%. The country’s  coal  requirement is  expected to reach 1,123 million tonnes  by 2023 from the present 777.26 million tonnes. India’s total coal production increased by 6.74 % to  74.78 million tonnes during December 2021  compared  to the same period in 2019. Elevated mining reforms  and a growing focus on the mineral-led manufacture of  downstream metals is expected to catalyse the growth  of steel, aluminium, fertilizers and cement industry.  The growth of the country’s coal mining business is  driven by the Government’s decision to eliminate coal  imports by 2023-24. Moreover, the demand for coal in  the country is expected to be in the range of 1.3-1.5  billion tonnes by 2030, despite the push for renewable  energy.

Quality airport infrastructure influences national  competitiveness, enabling a systematic movement of  people and cargo. Indian airports handled 20.97 lakh  tonnes of freight in 2021-22 (till November) compared  to 14.44 lakh tonnes during the same period in the  previous year, recording a growth of 45.25 per cent.  This was slightly lower than the air cargo loading of  22.88 lakh tonnes during the pre-pandemic period of  April-November 2019. India is a large market for travel and tourism. The travel  market in India is projected to reach US$ 125 billion by  FY 2026-27 from an estimated US$ 75 billion in FY 2019- 20. Also, the Indian airline travel market was estimated  at US$ 20 billion and is projected to double in size by   FY 27, owing to improved airport infrastructure and  growing access to passports. Besides, superior airport  infrastructure catalyses the growth of the tourism  sector, creating higher employment opportunities in  the country. India’s passenger traffic stood at 115.37 million in 2021  and is likely to reach 520 million by 2037. To cater to  the rising air traffic, the Government of India worked  towards increasing the number of airports. The rising  demand in the sector pushed the number of airplanes  operating in the sector. The number of airplanes is  expected to reach 1,100 planes by 2027. The number  of operational airports is projected to increase to 190- 200 by FY 2039-40. Moreover, the travel and tourism  industry is expected to contribute US$ 512 billion to  the GDP of the country by 2028, catalysed by growing  population, higher disposable incomes, increased fare  affordability, cost effectiveness, wider airline choice,  increased preference for better travelling modes, better  inter-modal connectivity, investment in modern aircraft  fleet and others. The Government of India took various initiatives to  address the incidence of growing air traffic in the  country. The Government of India launched a regional  connectivity scheme named UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam  Nagrik) to make flying affordable for the common man.  The Government also planned to invest H25,000 Crore  (US$ 3.58 billion) in five years to augment facilities and  infrastructure at airports.

Strong infrastructure enables  a country and its corporations to be competitive while  helping uplift people from poverty. The result is that  India’s infrastructure sector stood at the cusp of rapid  growth, driven by government reforms, incentives and  long-term prospects. In FY2020-21, the sector was  estimated to contribute nearly 4% to the GDP of the  country. The Government planned to invest H111 lakh Crore  (US$ 1.5 trillion) in National Infrastructure Pipeline to  complete projects by 2025. In FY 2021-22, US$ 100  billion was invested through FDI in the infrastructure  sector. From roads, ports, airports to power, water,  health and technology, each needed to grow in a  robust manner led by government investments and  risk sharing, bold policy initiatives, PPP models and  tax breaks, particularly for private participation and  a  necessary focus on skill development. These initiatives  are expected to help meet the US$ 5 trillion economy  target by FY 2024-25 and US$ 10 trillion by 2030.

The size of the Indian copper industry is around  6.6 lakh tonnes per annum, merely 3% of the world  copper market as of 2021. The factors that influence  d the growth of the copper in India are the regulations  and performance of London Metal Exchange, currency  exchange rates, infrastructure developments, electric  industry, telecom boost, renewable energy, electric  vehicles, consumer durables, among others. Further,  the sector is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7% until  2030. India’s per capita consumption of copper stood at  0.5 Kg against global average of 3.1 Kg. In terms of  exploration, only 20,000 sq.km. area is explored out of  a potential 60,000 sq.km in India. To boost recycling of  copper in India, the Indian government announced  a  reduction in the import duty on copper scrap from 5%  to 2.5%. (Source: mines.gov.in, IBEF) Petrochemicals: India’s petrochemical industry is one  of the fastest-growing industries in the country. The  country ranks sixth globally and fourth in Asia in terms  of global sale of chemicals. More than 80,000 varieties  of chemicals and petrochemicals were manufactured  in the country. The industry employed over two million  people per year. The petrochemicals market was estimated at US$ 700  million in 2021. Petrochemicals are a part of our day  to day lives – used in manufacturing, construction,  packaging,  agriculture,  textile  and  apparel,  pharmaceuticals and others. In terms of volume, the  petrochemical market in India stood at 42.50 million  tonnes in 2021 and is expected to reach 49.62 million  tonnes by 2025, growing at a CAGR of ~6.14% between  FY 2021 and FY 2025. The petrochemical market in India is segregated into  three divisions - basic petrochemicals, intermediates  and  other  petro-based  chemicals.  The  basic  petrochemicals segment (polymers, synthetic fibres,  synthetic rubber, synthetic detergent intermediates  and others) dominated the market, accounting  for ~45.53% of the share of the market volume in  2020. This growth was catalysed by the increasing  consumption of high-density polyethylene (HDPE),  linear low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene  and polyvinyl chloride, among others. The Indian  Government set up a 2034 vision for the chemicals  and petrochemicals sector to seize opportunities,  strengthen domestic manufacturing, reduce imports  and attract investments for manufacturing key  chemicals. Moreover, with the concept of a self-reliant  India, the country is expected to attract H8 lakh Crore  investments by 2025 to emerge as a front runner in the  global chemical and petrochemical industry.

India’s hydrogen  demand is around 6.7 million tonnes in 2022. It is  expected to approximately double by 2030 and  the cost is expected to decline by 50 per cent. Oil  refineries, fertiliser plants and steel units are the major  consumers of hydrogen in India. Presently, a majority  of the demand is addressed by grey hydrogen, which  is produced from fossil fuels (natural gas or naphtha).  With the increased deployment of renewable power  capacity, the cost of renewable electricity has fallen  sharply to make green hydrogen more feasible. The emerging focus on green hydrogen, produced using  renewable energy, has some of the best environmental  credentials among cleaner-burning fuels. The zero- carbon fuel is produced using renewable power from  wind/solar sources. With India’s low renewable energy  cost advantage, the cost of green hydrogen in the  country is poised to fall to about 1/4 of global levels  of green as well as grey hydrogen to less than USD 1  per kg, potentially making the country the lowest- cost producer of green hydrogen across the world.  In addition, India plans to manufacture five million  tonnes of green hydrogen per annum by 2030, aiming  to make India a green hydrogen hub. To support this  transition from grey hydrogen to green hydrogen  and cater to growing hydrogen demand, the country  plans to invest in innovation, R&D and demonstration  projects to support the commercialisation of upcoming  technologies and accelerate the cost reduction of  green hydrogen. The demand for hydrogen is forecasted  to witness a 5-fold jump to 28 million tonnes by 2050;   ===== PAGE 161 ===== 159 Annual Report 2021-22 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 80 per cent of this demand is expected to be green in  nature.

The electrolyser is a device that utilises electricity  to break water into oxygen and hydrogen, making it the  most vital part in making hydrogen economically viable.  To produce green hydrogen through any process,  electrolysis is essential. India plans to provide federal  financial support to set up electrolysers as it proposed  to mandate using green hydrogen for fertilizer and  refining plants, catalysing the growth of electrolysers. Presently, the alkaline water electrolysis technique is  being used in India, which consumes more electricity to  produce hydrogen, while the use of polymer electrolyte  membrane (PEM) electrolysis could bring down the  electricity requirement, resulting in a cost reduction  for hydrogen production. The  Indian  government  launched  the  National  Hydrogen Energy Mission on 15th August, 2021 to  enable competitive green hydrogen production and  plans to emerge as a global leader in green hydrogen.  With this vision, the country is seeking bids for 4,000  MW of electrolyser capacity and battery energy system  storage system of 4,000 MWh capacity. India is also  targeting 15 Gigawatts (GW) of electrolyser-making  capacity and considering production-linked incentives  to boost local manufacturing.

In India, the battery storage market  is witnessing significant opportunities in electrified  mobility and storage requirements. India’s power  battery market was estimated at US$ 1.66 billion in  2020 and expected to surpass US$ 15 billion (~₹1.12  trillion) by 2030. The country’s demand is expected  to rise to 260 GWh by 2030, driven by the increasing  demand  for  electric  vehicles  (EVs),  consumer  electronics, stationary storage and others. According  to Mercom India, India is positioned to capture a large  share of the global storage market and contribute up  to 13% of the global battery demand by 2030. India has a vast potential for large-scale battery  manufacturing, which support the growth of electric  vehicles, grid storage and energy security. Moreover,  the Indian government’s target of manufacturing  30% of new vehicle sales as electric by 2030 and 34  GW/136 GWh of battery storage needed to add 450GW  of renewables in India by 2030, could drive the nation  to become a key lithium battery consumer.

With a population of 1.38 billion  people, India is the second most populous country. The  average annual per capita water availability in 2001  and 2011 was assessed as 1,816 cubic meters and 1,545  cubic meters respectively, which reduced to 1,486  cubic meters in 2021 and could reduce to 1,367 cubic  meters in 2031.. At 250 billion cubic metres per year,  India is the largest consumer of ground water in the  world, consuming more than China and the US - the  next two largest consumers ( combined ). India is also facing a freshwater crisis. India has just  4% of the world’s fresh water but 16% of the global  population. More than 6% of this population lacks  access to safe water and about 15% of India’s population  practices open defecation. A lack of household water  connections and toilets contributes largely to water- borne illnesses, stunting, and death. Therefore, 6%  of India’s GDP is estimated to be affected due to the  water crisis of the country. Over the coming years, the water requirement across  all the sectors could increase due to the growing  population. Nearly 40% of the population could have  absolutely no access to drinking water by 2030. With  rising population and industrialization, it was expected  that there would be an increase in the amount of sewage  and industrial waste being generated. Moreover, there  could be a significant imbalance between the water  demand and water resource availability by 2050,  thereby causing water scarcity.

India accounted for 3.7% of the global  military spending, making it the third highest military  spender in the world. The expenditure on the defence  sector constituted 15.5% of the Central Government’s  budget and nearly 2.1% of India’s GDP for 2020-21.  With a growing demand from the defence sector, the  government identified it as one of the core areas to  boost ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ or ‘Self-reliant India’. The  Defence Ministry has set a target of 70% self-reliance  in weaponry by 2027, creating large prospects for  industry players. The export of defence items, including major items,  was INR 8,434.84 Crore in FY 2020-21 compared to  INR 1,521.00 Crore in FY 2016-17. The country focusing  on innovative solutions to empower the country’s  defence and security via ‘Innovations for Defence  Excellence (iDEX)’, which provided a platform for start- ups to connect to defence establishments and develop  new technologies/products in five years (2021-2026). The Indian government spelt out a turnover target of  US$ 25 billion (including exports of US$ 5 billion in  aerospace and defence goods and services) by 2025.  To support defence modernisation, in the Budget  2021-22, the defence capital outlay increased by  18.75% the preceding year, highest ever increment  in the over 15 years. The Indian government has  also called for increased participation of defence  manufacturing companies from the private sector to  cater to the growing demand. The opening up of the  Indian defence industry also paved the way for foreign  original equipment manufacturers to enter strategic  partnerships with defence equipment manufacturers  in India. Besides, the Indian government enhanced  foreign direct investment (FDI) in the defence sector  up to 74% through the automatic route for companies  seeking new defence industrial license and up to 100%  by the government route. This will boost defence  manufacturing in India and make the country a  trustworthy weapons supplier to friendly nations.

India also ranked fifth  in terms of installed capacity of solar power, as of  March 2022. The country is targeting about 500 GW  of installed renewable energy capacity by 2030, of  which about 280 GW (over 60%) is expected from solar  power. Imports of solar cells and modules increased by  448% to US$ 1.97 billion in the first nine months of the  calendar year 2021 compared to imported solar cells  and modules (US$ 359.93 million) in the same period  last year. The Indian Government seeks to develop a ‘green city’  in every State of the country, powered by renewable  energy. The ‘green city’ will mainstream environment- friendly power through solar rooftop systems on all  houses, solar parks on the city’s outskirts, waste-to  -energy plants and electric mobility-enabled public  transport systems. Indian government policies, like  allowing 100% FDI under the automatic route for  renewable power generation and distribution projects,  are expected to increase the participation from global  players in the Indian market. Edible oils: India is the world’s second-largest consumer  of edible oil. India’s edible oils market was estimated  at US$ 3.54 billion in 2020. It is expected to grow at  a CAGR of 6.82% from 2021 to 2027, reaching almost   US $ 5.72 billion in 2027. The growth could be catalysed  by  an increasing population, rising disposable incomes,  urbanisation, awareness of healthy and hygienic  foods and changing dietary habits with an increasing  shift towards processed foods with a high content of  vegetable oils. The edible oils sector occupies an important spot in  the agricultural economy, accounting for an estimated  production of 36.56 million tonnes of nine cultivated  oilseeds during 2020-21 as per the Ministry of  Agriculture. Though oilseeds production in India grew  by almost 43% from 2015-16 to 2020-21,  production  lagged consumption, necessitating imports of edible  oil. Less than half of India’s edible oil consumption is  met through the domestic production of oilseeds such  as mustard, groundnut, and soybean. The country is  one of the largest importers of edible oil. Edible oil  imports increased by 63% to H1.17 trillion during the oil  year 2021-22 compared to H71,625 Crore in the previous  year. It is further expected to grow at a rate of 3.4% per  annum till 2030, owing to increasing irregularities in  demand and supply of the sector. Therefore, edible oils  consumption in India is expected to remain high due to  population growth, dietary habits and traditional meal  patterns expected to shift towards processed foods.  As per the OECD-FAO Agricultural Outlook 2021-2030,  India is projected to maintain a high per capita edible  oils consumption growth of 2.6% per annum, reaching  14 kg/capita by 2030. To make the country self- reliant in terms of edible oil and reduce dependence  on imports, the Indian government urged farmers to  embrace the National Mission on Edible Oils – Oil Palm  (NMEO-OP) as a pledge for achieving self-reliance in  edible oil and committed to provide a financial outlay  of H11,000 in the cooking oil ecosystem. The Mission  aims to add additional areas for production (6.5 lakh  hectares) and increasing productivity of oilseeds in the  country.

Defence & aerospace After some of the most pathbreaking steps in FY 21,  FY 22 was a watershed year for the Indian Defence  industry. The Indian Government continued its drive  towards Atmanirbharta in defence manufacturing with  an import embargo on multiple defence items as well  undertaking an unprecedented review of all import  procurements. The complex geopolitical situation  towards the end of 2021-22 reinforced the need for self- reliance and need for preparedness for a large-scale  conflict. The Union Budget for 2022-23 reserved 68%  of the capital procurement budget for the domestic  defence industry. As a testimony to the importance of  the unmanned systems, the Indian Government banned  imports of drones in the country. The Company continued to deepen and broad base its  capabilities across its key focus areas with a resulting  order book of almost H8,000 Crore. The volatile  situation at the borders prompted fast track capital  equipment purchases for bolstering national security  and your company bagged three prestigious orders  with a total order value of more than H500 Crore. The  Company operationalized a state-of-the-art simulator  for MiG29 aircraft for the Indian Air Forces in Adampur  under a first of its kind Build Operate Maintain contract  for over 20 years.

Airports India’s airports infrastructure is at the cusp of its biggest  change, the Indian Government moving to a PPP model  for the airports it operates, creating an unprecedented  investment opportunity for the private sector. In the  recent past, the Government of India proposed and  implemented policy changes and guidance for the  improvement of the sector. From being a luxury, air travel has been democratised  to the point that it has become accessible through  affordable pricing and widening connectivity. Between  FY 2009-10 and FY 2019-20, air traffic grew at a CAGR  of 11% and yet remained one of the least penetrated  large global aviation markets. With the projected  growth of the Indian economy Government support,  growing household incomes and a larger number of  millennials influencing consumption, India’s aviation  sector is expected to report robust growth. The  Adani  Group  ventured  into  the  airports  infrastructure  business  in  2019  through  Adani  Enterprises Limited (AEL) and AEL’s ability to incubate  new businesses and financial strength allowed long- term strategic bets. Airports Authority of India (AAI) adopted a single-stage  electronic bidding process for the selection of the bidder  for the award of the project. The Company emerged as  the highest bidder on a fee per passenger basis for six  airports. The concession agreement for Ahmedabad,  Lucknow and Mangaluru airports were signed on 14th  February, 2020 and the Concession Agreements for  the Jaipur, Guwahati and Thiruvanthapuram airports  were signed on 19th January, 2021. The Company  commenced operations in Ahmedabad, Lucknow  and Mangaluru airports in FY 2020-21 while the  commencement of operations in Jaipur, Guwahati  and Thiruvanthapuram started from October 2021.  The Company has completed the process of acquiring  Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL). Following  the completion of this transaction, Adani Group had   seven operational airports and one greenfield airport  under its fold. Navi Mumbai International Airport  Limited (NMIAL), subsidiary of MIAL, is building a  state-of-the art and world-class airport scheduled to  commence its commercial operations by December  2024. With an estimated capex of H19,500 Crore,  NMIAL is being build to handle 20 MPPA traffic in  Phase 1. In line with its vision of responsible nation  building, the Company intends to transform the Indian  airports infrastructure sector. The Company intends to  design revolutionary airports that reimagine the future,   ===== PAGE 170 ===== 168 Adani Enterprises Limited CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS offer seamless processes that facilitate touch-less  operations, especially in the post COVID-19 era, when  social distancing will be the new norm and to create a  ‘gateway to goodness.’ The Company’s business model assures a hybrid  revenue model, including aero and non-aero revenues.  The non-aero focus, is to be directed towards the  development of airport villages that can address   non-passenger airport visitors. An entry into this  business is in line with the Adani Group’s philosophy  of bridging its B2B and B2C businesses. The airports  business will create strategic adjacencies for the  existing business of the Adani Group. These airports  handle 25% of India’s air traffic consumer base of 300+  Mn people. The Company intends to provide end-to- end integration, committed to the best ASQ ratings  across categories. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and  its subsequent waves have significantly impacted  the flight operations throughout the country, which  affected the industry’s growth. However, as the Covid  situation improves the aviation sector is expected to  see a revival. The Company’s focus does not end in  only providing a quality travelling experience but also a  distinctive experience to non- travelling clients. The  aviation  industry  experienced  numerous  changes in recent years. From passenger processing  regulations, modernization within airport buildings to  the introduction of biometric technology, airports have  experienced  a rapidly changing environment. Adani Airports continues its digital transformation  journey  to  provide  stakeholders  a  wealth  of  opportunities. Our ability to identify, prioritize and  implement digital solutions like Pranaam Services,  Passenger Self Service Solutions, Centralized Airport  Control Center, Airport Operations System, Customer  Relationship Management and Electronic Point of  Sales System have been critical to success. The outlook for the airport infrastructure business  is positive on account of the government’s decision  to progressively divest ownership stakes in Indian  airports in favour of private operators. This divestment  and related opportunities are expected to accelerate  the modernization of infrastructure, turning them  into showpieces of a global standard. The Company  enjoys a decisive advantage in emerging as a sectorial  outlier within only a couple of years of entering the  business, holding attractive prospects of outsized and  sustainable growth across the long-term. The Company  intends to re-define India’s airports infrastructure sector  through gateway development, regional footprint  growth, focus on consumers and non-passengers and  deeper investment in digital technology interventions  that could widen the consumer choice and delight.  The outlook for the Company is underpinned by the  fact that India is expected to emerge as the third  largest aviation market, catalyzed by the Government’s  decision to advocate the public-private partnership  model, graduate India into an MRO hub, flexible use  of air space and a matured regulatory framework with  assured returns. Solar manufacturing Since five years, the Company has been operating a  vertically integrated solar photovoltaic manufacturing  facility of 1.2 GW capacity along with Research and  Development (R&D) Centre within an Electronic  Manufacturing Cluster (EMC) facility at Mundra. It  remains the first and the largest GW scale integrated  facility in India, with the capability to produce modules  up to 1.5 GW following debottlenecking done through  process engineering and innovation. The Company expanded its module manufacturing  capacity to 3.5 GW by adding 2 GW of hi-tech and fully  automated PERC Bifacial Module Lines. The Company  will soon be setting up the cell lines to make this  expansion fully integrated. Mundra Solar PV Limited (MSPVL), a step-down  subsidiary of AEL, can be looked upon as a success  story of Government of India’s Make in India initiative  with backward integration through ancillaries such as  EVA, backsheet & aluminium frame within the same  EMC facility. Currently, a glass manufacturing facility  is also under implementation. MSPVL continues to  lead the domestic solar PV Industry in terms of scale  and technology. It is the only manufacturer in India to  have produced Mono p-PERC and n-PERT Bifacial cells  besides the multi MCCE wafer-to-cell on a commercial  scale. MSPVL will be among the first few in the country  to start manufacturing the mono P-PERC type cells  with 182 mm and 210 mm wafers. The cutting-edge  technology, with machines and equipment sourced  from the best-in-class producers, aim to help in cost  leadership, scale of operations and reliability standards  as per global benchmarks. The Company’s vision is to  become a measure of success in the solar Industry by  innovating, benchmarking and improving continuously. The Company aligned itself with Government of India’s  aim of 300 GW of solar installation by 2030 with  a  focus on the solarization of agricultural pumps under  the KUSUM Scheme and increasing rooftop solar  installations. In a sector dominated by cheap Chinese  imports, the Company has been able to maintain a  robust order book, particularly in the domestic content  requirement (DCR) segment, due to which asset  utilization has been at its fullest. Since the inception of  business in 2017, MSPVL sold about 4.4 GW of modules,  catering to Indian and global demand. It provides  modules across the Indian subcontinent for various  utility scale installations, both for DCR schemes and  other open category projects in states like Rajasthan,  Telangana, Tamil Nadu, and Union Territory of Andaman   ===== PAGE 171 ===== 169 Annual Report 2021-22 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS & Nicobar Islands. Out of 82,408 solar pumps (~556  MW) installed under KUSUM Scheme till February  2022, MSPVL supplied modules for 307 MW (~55%).  MSPVL has established a pan-India presence through  22 channel partners and 16 resellers, for catering to the  Residential rooftop segment. MSPVL was classified as a Tier-1 bankable module  supplier by Bloomberg NEF within the first year of  its operation. It was rated as top performer in the  Product Quality Program (PQP) by PVEL-DNV-GL,  for four consecutive years (2018 to 2021), across all  major reliability tests for PERC and Bifacial Products.  A ‘Positive’ outlook and ratings upgrade to A- by Indian  rating agencies helped the Company reduce financing  cost and maintain the highest levels of operational  performance. 1,104 MW modules Manufacturing volume during  FY22 Data centre The digital economy in India is expected to create  a value of USD 1 trillion by 2025. Data Centers are  enablers of digital transformation, acting as a platform  to create value from data and data management,  playing a significant role in the growth of digital-first  India. The grant of ‘Infrastructure Status’ to the data centre  industry during the recent Union Budget of India was  an acknowledgement of the growing dependence of  the success of other industries on data centres. India’s  data centre industry is poised to report a strong growth  which stood at 499 MW* as of H1 2021 and is expected  to grow to 1007 MW by 2023 . The four major segments that driving the data centre  growth in India are Enterprise, Government, Cloud  players and Tech-native businesses. -	 The Enterprises are not just generating more data  but also migrating their workloads from captive to  third-party co-location data centers and public/ hybrid cloud. -	 Government is acting as an enabler in driving  demand through various key digitization initiatives  such as Smart Cities, Digital India, Meghraj and  Aadhar etc. -	 India’s  public  cloud  services  market  (IaaS+SaaS+PaaS) is estimated to reach US$10.8  billion by 2025, growing at CAGR of 24.1% for  2020-25. Due to high-end customer demand, these  players will need more cloud regions in India. -	 Tech-native businesses such as ecommerce,  fintech, OTT, e-learning, video conferencing, online  gaming and others revolutionized our modern  economy and are emerging as a key driver of data  storage and computing demand.

Adani Agri Fresh Limited Adani Agri Fresh Limited (AAFL), a wholly owned  subsidiary of the Company pioneered the establishment  of an integrated storage, handling and transportation  infrastructure for apples in Himachal Pradesh for 16  years. Since inception in 2006, AAFL set up modern  Controlled Atmosphere (CA) storage facilities at three  locations in Rewali, Sainj and Rohru in Shimla District  of Himachal Pradesh. AAFL set up a marketing network  in major towns across India to cater to the needs of  wholesale, retail and organized retail chain stores. AAFL, which is marketing Indian fruits under the brand  name FARM-PIK, expanded its footprint in the branded  fruit segment with a focus on pouch/punnet packs  along with gift packs. AAFL consolidated its presence  in the pomegranate and grapes value chain and grew  its basket of domestic fruits with the introduction of  mangoes. The production of apples during 2021-22 was in line  with the negative trend of the previous two years as  the production areas were impacted by hailstorms  and poor weather. AAFL took steps to mitigate these  risks by taking a CA unit on lease at Harshil, Uttarkashi  District, Uttarakhand and developed a strategy to cover  all apple growing regions in North India. As plant operations returned to normalcy with strict  protocols on Covid-19 prevention at the beginning  of the year, there were no further interruptions to  business. Competition from domestic CA operators  continued to increase but AAFL leased additional  facilities in neighboring regions. The global apple production was stable at around 90  Mn MT while demand in India grew rapidly in the post- pandemic period. An increased focus on health and  immunity increased the demand for multiple fresh fruit.  As a result, India’s import of apples more than doubled  in 2021-22 over the previous year. Apple production in European countries was only  marginally higher than the previous year while the ban  on importing apples from China and the increased duty  on Washington apples from USA caused a major surge  in imports from Iran and Turkey. Overall, AAFL met profitability targets for the year by  entering into agreements with organized retail and  e-commerce grocery players with negotiated pricing  for large volumes.  ===== PAGE 173 ===== 171 Annual Report 2021-22 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Details of significant changes in key financial ratios and Return on Net Worth Pursuant to amendment made in Schedule V to the SEBI Listing Regulations, details of significant changes   (i.e. change of 25% or more as compared to the immediately previous financial year) in Key Financial Ratios and  any changes in Return on Net Worth of the Company (on standalone basis) including explanations therefor are  given below: Particulars FY ended  31st March,  2022 FY ended  31st March,  2021 Changes  between  Current FY &  Previous FY Explanation Debtor’s turnover 8.68  4.11  111.53% Due to significant increases in commodity  prices, revenue from operations increased  significantly against average trade receivables.

This  can consequently affect our  business operations, customer  satisfaction and profitability. The Company strives to foster a safe  working environment and ensure Zero Harm.  Hazards and risks are periodically identified,  with mitigation plans devised for each.  Additionally, safety trainings are provided to  employees and workers on regular basis to  ensure their holistic well-being. Negative 2 Community  Development Opportunity Community development  activities help the Company  to create a positive impact  on society by undertaking  meaningful interventions  to bring significant benefits  to large sections of society.  The CSR efforts also help  foster a more productive and  positive work environment for  employees.  The Adani Foundation has been striving  to create sustainable opportunities for the  marginalized communities by facilitating  quality education, sustainable livelihood  development, promoting a healthy society  and supporting rural infrastructure  development. The Adani Foundation’s  outreach as of now has been to 2,409 villages  in 16 States across India. With an aim to contribute to the holistic  development of communities, the Adani  Foundation is contributing to the global  agenda of meeting Sustainable Development  Goals (SDGs). Positive 3 Ecological  Impact Risk Reducing the Company’s  ecological impact is crucial to  mitigating climate change and  the physical and transition risks  that accompany it. Various policies – including the Climate  Change Policy, Resource Conservation  Policy, Water Stewardship Policy and Energy  Management Policy – have been instituted to  reduce the Company’s ecological impact.

Non-adherence to business  ethics and integrity related  compliance obligations can  lead to legal fines and penalties,  financial forfeiture, damage  to brand reputation, loss of  business opportunities and  valuation. We adhere to the highest standards  when it comes to personal and collective  integrity, reflected by compliance with the  standards stipulated by the government,  other regulatory agencies, and peer global  standards. Over the years, we have further  strengthened our commitment to gender  respect, zero tolerance for sexual harassment,  zero tolerance on ethical transgressions,  commitment to recruit without prejudice and  appraise without partialness, respect for the  dignity of people and environment integrity  and respect for the laws of the lands of our  presence. The Company has also formulated and  implemented a Code of Business Conduct  and Ethics for all its Board members and  senior management personnel, in compliance  with corporate governance requirements as  per the SEBI Listing Regulations. Apart from  this, Adani Group’s Code of Conduct is also  applicable to all employees across Adani  Group, including the Company. Negative 5 Human Rights Risk Failing to address human rights  issues can risk damaging brand  value and reputation and can  also bring an increasing risk of  litigation and of non-compliance  with a growing body of  legislation in the area. The Company has constituted a standing  forum, both at the Group Level as well as at  individual entity level, that aids and advises  the management in its approach towards  building sustainable Human Rights. Group HR  through Business HR is responsible to ensure  that any issue or impact related to human  rights are addressed in the defined manner  within the stipulated timeline. Negative 6 Water  management Risk We are directly affected by  the availability and quality of  water considering the nature  of business operations. Water  scarcity can interrupt our  business operations, disrupt  supply chains, raise the costs  of raw materials, and put  employee’s and community’s  health and safety at risk.  It may also lead to loss of  social license to operate due to  competition for water with local  communities.  As water is material to our operations, it  becomes a business imperative for us to  optimize its consumption and move towards  water security. Reduction of freshwater  consumption, water recycling/reusing and  water saving initiatives are part of our  water management strategy. We have also  instituted a Water Stewardship Policy, which  serves as a guiding principle to reduce  consumption of water in the operation and  conserve water wherever feasible. Negative 7 Waste  Management Risk Waste management has become  a global issue impacting the  environment and health of the  people. Industries are one of the  large generators of hazardous  waste and are directed by the  pollution control board (PCB) for  waste management practices.  Not abiding to the practices  prescribed the PCBs may lead to  legal penalties and impact the  brand image. At AEL level, we have instituted a Resource  Conservation Policy, which serves as a  guiding principle to reduce generation  of waste, treat the waste, and dispose in  environmentally friendly manner.  The Company has defined processes for  managing waste at each of its sites/locations.  We follow the basic principle of segregation  of the waste at source & adopt the 3R  concept of “reduce, reuse & recycle”.

No Material issue  identified Indicate  whether  risk or  opportunity  (R/O) Rationale for identifying the risk  / opportunity In case of risk, approach to adapt or mitigate Financial  implications of the  risk or opportunity  (Indicate the  positive/negative  implications) 8 Energy and  Emissions  management Risk /  Opportunity Considering India’s commitment  to become NET ZERO by 2070,  stringent energy and emission  related laws and regulations  may be enacted for companies  to follow. If as a Company we  are not prepared in time to  comply with these emerging  laws and regulations, we may  face additional unexpected  cost to comply as a result of  not timely anticipating to the  new requirements. Business  restrictions leading to loss of  revenue and/or additional costs  may also force our business to  change our business model. Energy is one of the major overhead costs  for our business operations. There is an  opportunity to make cost savings through  implementing various energy efficiency  projects such as using high energy efficient  equipment, on-site renewables installations,  wherever feasible, etc. which not only  reduce carbon emissions but also deliver  cost savings. We expect that our ambition to  eliminate direct greenhouse gas emissions  from operations will not only lower overhead  costs but will improve resilience in our  energy supply and attract investors who are  increasingly considering carbon emission  as a risk. This may also help us to identify  new business opportunities in the clean  technologies sector. Establishment of Adani  New Industries Limited as a subsidiary of the  Company and an investment plan of $50-70  billion across the energy transition value  chain by Adani Group’s businesses, signals our  commitment. In case of risk: The energy-intensive nature of our business  operations not only drives us towards energy  saving measures but also directs us to  increase the share of clean energy in our  overall energy mix. We also have an Energy  Management Policy, designed to aid and  formalize the Company’s efforts to manage  its energy consumption and  emissions,  integrate renewable energy sources wherever  feasible, and adopt efficient ways of energy  usage. To accomplish our goals of resource  conservation, we regularly monitor our energy  performance at all our operating units. Negative / Positive 9 Labor Practices Risk /  Opportunity Risk:  Failing to manage sound labor  management practices can lead  to prosecution by regulators,  insurance claims due to  accidents and injuries, reduce  employee motivation in turn  leading to loss of productivity  and also hamper the brand  image and reputation. Opportunity: Ensuring sound labour practices  allows the organisation to avoid  regulatory action, penalties and  empower its employees and  workers. We remain committed to providing a safe  work environment for our employees,  contractual workers, visitors and the  community at large. We have adopted Adani  Group’s Safety Mgt. System which focusses  on the improvement of working conditions,  working environment and the protection and  promotion of workers’ health.  We have implemented a robust Contract  Labour Management System and the  registration process ensures that the entire  contractual workforce is above legal minimum  age for employment as defined by the legal  authority. We also have a grievance redressal  process at our locations for our employees.  The Company adheres to all the laws of the  land, related to human rights and labour  practices.

Emerging and  potential regulations may  introduce or escalate regulatory  risks. AEL draws on input from subject matter  experts as and when required to identify  and manage exposure to risks and impacts  associated with emerging regulations.  Impacts to business considered include  regulatory/legal impacts, health, safety,  environment and community impacts, and  reputational impacts. We see climate change also as an opportunity  for us as the low-carbon transition creates  opportunities for efficiency, innovation and  growth. Through investment and clean  technologies, AEL businesses can save  energy and materials costs, serve new  customer needs, enhance their reputations  and better attract and retain talent - all as  a consequence of working to reduce their  emissions and those of their customers  and suppliers. Establishment of Adani New  Industries Limited as a subsidiary of AEL and  an investment plan of $50-70 billion across  the energy transition value chain by Adani  Group’s businesses, signals our commitment  and identified opportunity on climate change Negative / Positive 11 Responsible  Supply Chain Opportunity Organizations are under  increased pressure from  investors, customers, and  regulators to mitigate  environmental, social and  governance (ESG) risk exposures  within their supply chain. Not  having sustainable supply  chain management practices,  a company may be exposed  to more risks including labor  disruptions, workforce health  and safety incidents, human  rights issues, and shortages of  raw materials. At AEL, we see responsible supply chain as  an opportunity, as considering sustainability  in selecting and maintaining suppliers, we  can effectively reduce overall risk, improve  our brand equity, and attract new clientele  including investors and top talent.

The Group strongly believes  that embedding Environmental, Social, and Governance  (ESG) principles in its business operations is not only a  responsibility but an essential part of our DNA. Adherence  to these principles helps build resilience, transform culture  and long-term value creation to systematically identify  opportunities, manage risks, and secure the interest of all  our stakeholders. The Company, a flagship entity of Adani Group, is India’s  most successful incubator of tomorrow’s businesses and  its journey parallels India’s growth story. All the Company’s businesses have undertaken a  rigorous mapping of their emission footprint and will  adhere to transparent disclosure and validation through  internationally reputed platforms. Each of our businesses  aims to be a sector leader in reducing direct emissions, in  sourcing renewable energy for operations, and will work  with value chain partners to reduce indirect emissions. We are deeply conscious of our responsibility to help  marginalized and underprivileged communities wherever  we operate. This commitment goes beyond job creation  and embraces a wide range of initiatives in partnership  with the Adani Foundation that have touched millions of  lives across thousands of villages, driving beneficial change  in education, health, infrastructure, and sustainable  livelihood development. We are one of the first companies in India to deploy a tree  trans-planter for transplanting Sal trees in mining areas.  All of our operational airports aim to achieve ACA Level 4+  by 2025, which is the highest-level achievement in global  carbon management certification for airports. We also aim  to be the first data center operator in India to operate on  100% renewable energy by 2030. Green Hydrogen will be an important ingredient of India’s  energy transition. Establishment of Adani New Industries  Limited as a subsidiary of the Company and an investment  plan of $50-70 billion across the energy transition  value chain by Adani Group’s businesses, signals our  commitment. Green Hydrogen will also play a critical role  in emission reduction for all sectors of the economy and  in this regard, we have recently signed a MoU with Ballard  Power, Canada to explore opportunities to manufacture  hydrogen fuel cells. The Company has made a notable progress in its ESG  journey and has received many recognitions, including the  prestigious “Aviation Sustainability & Environment” award  in March 2022 by Wings India to Mumbai Chhatrapati  Shivaji Maharaj International Airport.  ===== PAGE 219 ===== 217 Annual Report 2021-22 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Sr.  No. Disclosure Questions P1 P2 P3 P4 P5 P6 P7 P8 P9 8 Details of the highest authority responsible for  implementation and oversight of the Business  Responsibility policy(ies).

Does the entity have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing? (Yes/No) If yes, what percentage of inputs  were sourced sustainably? 	 Yes. The Company has a Suppliers’ Code of Conduct stating specific expectations for engaging with suppliers.  Here, “supplier” refers to material suppliers/service providers/vendors/traders/agents/ consultants/ contractors/ third parties including their employees, agents and other representatives, who have a business relationship  with and provide, sell, seek to sell, any kinds of goods or services to the Company or any of its subsidiaries and  associated entities. 	 The Suppliers’ Code of Conduct facilitates collaboration with our suppliers in the promotion of professional  and fair business practices that integrates respect of human rights, business ethics and environment.   Our objective is to ensure that we minimize our potential impacts on people and on the environment, and that  we manage business and reputation risks while capitalizing on opportunities. For example, we make efforts  to source supplies and services from local sources where possible. We also organize various capacity building  programs for our value chain partners. 	 We also encourage our suppliers to be compliant with social and environmental standards such as SA8000,  ISO 14001, and ISO 45001. All of our suppliers are expected to apply the Suppliers’ Code of Conduct or more  stringent standards in a manner that is appropriate and proportional to the nature and scale of their activities,  the goods that they supply and the services that they perform. 	 Apart from Supplier Code of Conduct, we have also implemented an internal system for vendor registration  which includes supplier screening based on ESG criteria. This system helps to ensure that the vendor onboarded  meets all the sustainability criteria defined by the system. 	 However, at present, percentage of inputs sourced sustainably is not currently mapped for AEL. 3.	 Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the  end of life, for (a) Plastics (including packaging) (b) E-waste (c) Hazardous waste and (d) other waste.

The hazardous  wastes are handled, segregated, stored and transported in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements  and best industry practices. 	 The hazardous waste is disposed of in an environmentally sound manner through authorized vendors for  recycling as required by regulation. 	 Apart from hazardous waste, the most significant types of non-hazardous waste streams include overburden  (generated by mining business), scrap metal, wood waste, glass, tires, e-waste, cardboard, and paper. Our  strategic intent is to eliminate or reduce the generation of waste to divert waste from disposal through reuse  and recycling wherever possible. All our businesses are working towards achieving Zero waste to landfill  certification wherever feasible. 4.

In our opinion and to the best of our information  and according to the explanations given to us, the  aforesaid Standalone Financial Statements give the  information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the  Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and  fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting  Standards prescribed under section 133 of the  Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting  Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended, (“Ind AS”) and  other accounting principles generally accepted in  India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at  31st March, 2022, its Profit and Other Comprehensive  Income, changes in equity and its cash flows for the  year ended on that date. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit of the Standalone Financial  Statements in accordance with the Standards on  Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act  (SAs). Our responsibilities under those Standards are  further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for  the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements  section of our report. We are independent of the  Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued  by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India  together with the independence requirements that  are relevant to our audit of the Standalone Financial  Statements under the provisions of the Act and the  Rules made there under, and we have fulfilled our  other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these  requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that  the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and  appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on  the Standalone Financial Statements. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our  professional judgment, were of most significance in  our audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of  the current year. These matters were addressed in  the context of our audit of the Standalone Financial  Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion  thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on  these matters. Annual Report 2021-22 241 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 244 ===== Sr.  No. Key Audit Matters Auditor’s Response 1 Contingent liabilities relating to taxation,  litigations and arbitrations The provisions and contingent liabilities relate  to ongoing litigations and claims with various  authorities and third parties. These relate to  direct tax, indirect tax, claims and other general  legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course  of business. As at the year ended 31st March,  2022, the amounts involved were significant.  The assessment of a provision or a contingent  liability requires significant judgement by the  Management of the Company because of the  inherent complexity in estimating future costs.  The amount recognised as a provision is the  best estimate of the expenditure. The provisions  and contingent liabilities are subject to changes  in the outcomes of litigations and claims and  the positions taken by the Management of the  Company. It involves significant judgement  and estimation to determine the likelihood and  timing of the cash outflows and interpretations  of the legal aspects, tax legislations and  judgements previously made by authorities. Principal Audit Procedures We have obtained an understanding of the process  followed by the Management of the Company for  assessment and determination of the amounts of  provisions and contingent liabilities relating to taxation,  litigations and claims. We have made inquiries about the status in respect of  significant provisions and contingent liabilities with  the Company’s internal tax and legal team, including  challenging the assumptions and critical judgements  made by the Company which impacted the computation  of the provisions and inspecting the computation. We  assessed  Management’s  conclusions  through  discussions held with their in-house legal counsel  and understanding precedents in similar cases. We  communicated with the Company’s external legal  counsel on the certain material litigations to establish  the likelihood of outflow of economic resources being  probable, possible or remote in respect of the litigations. We have involved subject matter experts with specialized  skills and knowledge to assist in the assessment of the  value of significant provisions and contingent liabilities  relating to the pending litigations, on sample basis, in light  of the nature of the exposures, applicable regulations  and related correspondence with the authorities. We also assessed and validated the adequacy and  appropriateness of the disclosures made by the  Management in the Standalone Financial Statements. 2 Timing of Revenue recognition and adjustments  for coal quality variances involving critical  estimates  Material estimation by the Company is involved  in recognition and measurement of its revenue.  The value and timing of revenue recognition for  sale of goods varies from contract to contract,  and the activity can span beyond the year end. Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when  control is transferred to the customers and  when there are no other unfulfilled obligations.  This requires detailed analysis of each sale  agreement/ contract /customer purchase order  regarding timing of revenue recognition. Inappropriate assessment could lead to a risk  of revenue being recognized on sale of goods  before the control in the goods is transferred to  the customer. Principal Audit Procedures We have assessed the Company’s accounting policies for  revenue recognition by comparing with the applicable  accounting standards i.e Ind AS 115; We have conducted testing of design, implementation  and operating effectiveness of key internal financial  controls over timing of recognition of revenue from  sale of goods and subsequent adjustments made to the  transaction price; We have also performed substantive audit procedures  on selected statistical samples of customer contracts.  Verified terms and condition related to acceptance of  goods, acknowledgement on delivery receipts and tested  the transit time to deliver the goods and its revenue  recognition. Our tests of details focused on period end  samples to verify only revenue pertaining to current year  is recognized based on terms and conditions set out in  sale agreements/ contracts and delivery documents. Adani Enterprises Limited 242 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 245 ===== Sr.  No. Key Audit Matters Auditor’s Response Subsequent adjustments are made to the  transaction price due to grade mismatch/ slippage of the transferred goods (coal). The  variation in the contract price if not settled  mutually between the parties to the contract is  referred to third party testing and the Company  estimates the adjustments required for revenue  recognition pending settlement of such dispute.  Such adjustments in revenue are made on  estimated basis following historical trend. Inappropriate estimation could lead to a risk  of revenue being overvalued or undervalued.  Accordingly, timing of recognition of revenue  and adjustments for coal quality variances  involving critical estimates is a key audit matter. We have assessed the appropriateness of the estimated  adjustments in the process. We also performed tests to  establish the basis of estimation of the consideration  and whether such estimates are commensurate with the  accounting policy of the Company. We have assessed the adequacy of disclosure in the  Standalone Financial Statements. 3 Measurement of inventory quantities of coal As at 31st March, 2022, the Company has  coal inventory of H 4,826.10 crores. This  was determined a key audit matter, as the  measurement of these inventory quantities  lying at the ports/ yards involves significant  judgement  and  estimate  resulting  from  measuring the surface area. The Company  uses internal and external experts, to perform  volumetric  assessments,  basis  which  the  quantity for these inventories is estimated. Principal Audit Procedures We have obtained an understanding and have evaluated  the design and operating effectiveness of controls over  physical count and measurement of such inventory; We have evaluated the competency and capabilities  of Management’s experts for quantification of the  inventories on sample basis. We have physically observed inventory measurement  and count procedures carried out by Management using  experts, to ensure its appropriateness and completeness;  and Our audit procedures also included obtaining and  inspecting,  inventory  measurement  and  physical  count results for such inventories, including assessing  and evaluating the results of analysis performed by  Management in respect of differences between book  and physical quantities. We have also verified that  the physical verification differences are appropriately  accounted for in the books of accounts. 4 Significant judgement relating to impairment  of investments in subsidiaries, associates and  jointly controlled entities The  Company  has  major  investments  in  subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled  entities aggregating to H 3,436.28 crores as at  31st March, 2022. The Management assesses  at least annually the existence of impairment  indicators of each shareholding in such  subsidiaries, associate and jointly controlled  entities. Principal Audit Procedures We obtained understanding of the Company’s policy  on assessment of impairment of investment in  subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities  and assumptions used by the Management including  design and implementation of controls. We have tested  operating effectiveness of those controls. We have assessed the methodology used by the  Management of the Company to estimate recoverable  value of each investment and consistency with the  relevant Ind AS. Annual Report 2021-22 243 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 246 ===== Sr.  No. Key Audit Matters Auditor’s Response The process and methodologies for assessing  and determining the recoverable amount of  each investments are based on the complex  assumptions, that by their nature imply the  use of Management’s judgement, in particular  with reference to identification of impairment  indicators, forecasting future cashflow relating  to period covered by the Company’s strategic  business plan, normalised cashflow assumed as  a basis for terminal values, as well as the long  term growth rates and discount rates applied to  such forecasted cash flow. Considering  the  judgement  required  for  estimating the cash flows and complexity of the  assumptions used, this is considered as a Key  Audit Matter. We compared the carrying value of the Company’s  investment in these subsidiaries, associates and jointly  controlled entities with their respective net asset values  as per the audited financial statements. With respect to the cases where indicators of impairment  were identified by the Management, we obtained the  projected future cash flows along with sensitivity  analysis thereof with respect to relevant investments.  We evaluated Management’s methodology, assumptions  and estimates used in the calculation and have involved  subject matter expert internally to evaluate the  appropriateness of the assumptions used. We evaluated the appropriateness of its accounting and  the disclosures, if any, for the impairment of investment. Information other than the Financial Statements  and Auditor’s Report thereon The Company’s Management and Board of Directors  are responsible for the preparation of the other  information. The other information comprises the  information included in the Management Discussion  and Analysis, Board’s Report including Annexure  to Board’s Report, Business Responsibility Report,  Corporate Governance and Shareholder’s Information,  but does not include the Standalone Financial  Statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the Standalone Financial Statements  does not cover the other information and we do not  express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the Standalone  Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read the  other information and, in doing so, consider whether  the other information is materially inconsistent  with the Standalone Financial Statements or our  knowledge obtained during the course of our audit  or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If,  based on the work we have performed, we conclude  that there is a material misstatement of this other  information, we are required to report that fact. We  have nothing to report in this regard. Management’s  and  Board  of  Director’s  Responsibility for the Standalone Financial  Statements The Company’s Management and the Board of  Directors are responsible for the matters stated in  Section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)  with respect to the preparation and presentation of  these Standalone Financial Statements that give a  true and fair view of the financial position, financial  performance including other comprehensive income,  cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in  accordance with the accounting principles generally  accepted in India, including the applicable Indian  Accounting Standards (Ind AS) prescribed under  Section 133 of the Act, read with the Companies  (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as  amended. This responsibility also includes maintenance of  adequate accounting records in accordance with the  provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of  the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds  and other irregularities; selection and application of  appropriate accounting policies; making judgments  and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;  and design, implementation and maintenance of  adequate internal financial controls, that were  operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and  completeness of the accounting records, relevant to  the preparation and presentation of the Standalone  Financial Statements that give a true and fair view  and are free from material misstatement, whether  due to fraud or error. In preparing the Standalone Financial Statements,  the Management and the Board of Directors are  responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to  continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,  matters related to going concern and using the going  concern basis of accounting unless Management  either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease  operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Adani Enterprises Limited 244 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 247 ===== The Board of Directors are also responsible for  overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. Auditor’s Responsibility for the Audit of the  Standalone Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance  about whether the Standalone Financial Statements  as a whole are free from material misstatement,  whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an  auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable  assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a  guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance  with SAs will always detect a material misstatement  when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or  error and are considered material if, individually or in  the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to  influence the economic decisions of users taken on  the basis of these Standalone Financial Statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise  professional judgment and maintain professional  skepticism throughout the audit. We also: §§ Identify and assess the risks of material  misstatement  of  the  Standalone  Financial  Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design  and perform audit procedures responsive to those  risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient  and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement  resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting  from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,  intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the  override of internal control. §§ Obtain an understanding of internal financial  controls relevant to the audit in order to design  audit procedures that are appropriate in the  circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the  Act, we are also responsible for expressing our  opinion on whether the Company has adequate  internal financial controls system in place and the  operating effectiveness of such controls. §§ Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of  accounting estimates and related disclosures  made by Management. §§ Conclude  on  the  appropriateness  of  Management’s use of the going concern basis  of accounting and, based on the audit evidence  obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists  related to events or conditions that may cast  significant doubt on the Company’s ability to  continue as a going concern. If we conclude that  a material uncertainty exists, we are required  to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the  related disclosures in the Standalone Financial  Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate,  to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based  on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of  our auditor’s report. However, future events or  conditions may cause the Company to cease to  continue as a going concern. §§ Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and  content of the Standalone Financial Statements,  including the disclosures, and whether the  Standalone Financial Statements represent the  underlying transactions and events in a manner  that achieves fair presentation. We communicate with those charged with governance  regarding, among other matters, the planned scope  and timing of the audit and significant audit findings,  including any significant deficiencies in internal  control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with  a statement that we have complied with relevant  ethical requirements regarding independence, and to  communicate with them all relationships and other  matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on  our independence, and where applicable, related  safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged  with governance, we determine those matters  that were of most significance in the audit of the  Standalone Financial Statements of the current year  and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe  these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or  regulation precludes public disclosure about the  matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we  determine that a matter should not be communicated  in our report because the adverse consequences of  doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh  the public interest benefits of such communication.

In our opinion the Company has, in all material aspects,  an adequate internal financial controls system over  financial reporting and such internal financial controls  over financial reporting were operating effectively  as at 31st March, 2022, based on the internal control  over financial reporting criteria established by the  Company considering the essential components of  internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit  of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting  issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of  India. Management’s Responsibilities for Internal  Financial Controls The Company’s Management is responsible for  establishing  and  maintaining  internal  financial  controls based on the internal control over financial  reporting criteria established by the Company  considering the essential components of internal  control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of  Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting  issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of  India (ICAI). These responsibilities include the design,  implementation and maintenance of adequate internal  financial controls that were operating effectively  for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its  business, including adherence to Company’s policies,  the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and  detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and  completeness of the accounting records, and the  timely preparation of reliable financial information, as  required under the Companies Act, 2013. Auditors’ Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the  Company’s internal financial controls over financial  reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit  in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of  Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting  (“the Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing,  issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under  section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the  extent applicable to an audit of internal financial  controls, both applicable to an audit of Internal  Financial Controls and, both issued by the Institute  of Chartered Accountants of India. Those Standards  and the Guidance Note require that we comply  with ethical requirements and plan and perform the  audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether  adequate internal financial controls over financial  reporting was established and maintained and if such  controls operated effectively in all material respects. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain  audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal  financial controls system over financial reporting and  their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal  financial controls over financial reporting included  obtaining an understanding of internal financial  controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk  that a material weakness exists, and testing and  evaluating the design and operating effectiveness  of internal control based on the assessed risk.  The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s  judgment, including the assessment of the risks of  material misstatement of the Standalone Financial  Statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained  is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for  our audit opinion on the Company’s internal financial  controls  system  over  financial  reporting  with  reference to Standalone Financial Statements. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over  Financial Reporting A Company’s internal financial control over financial  reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable  assurance regarding the reliability of financial  reporting and the preparation of financial statements  for external purposes in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles. A Company’s internal  financial control over financial reporting includes  those policies and procedures that Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of sub-section 3 of section 143 of the Companies  Act 2013 (the act). Adani Enterprises Limited 254 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 257 ===== (1)	 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in  reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the  transactions and dispositions of the assets of the  Company; (2)	 provide reasonable assurance that transactions  are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of  financial statements in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles, and that receipts  and expenditures of the Company are being  made only in accordance with authorizations of  Management and directors of the Company; and (3)	 provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention or timely detection of unauthorized  acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s  assets that could have a material effect on the  financial statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial  Controls over Financial Reporting Because of the inherent limitations of internal  financial controls over financial reporting, including  the possibility of collusion or improper Management  override of controls, material misstatements due to  error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also,  projections of any evaluation of the internal financial  controls over financial reporting to future years are  subject to the risk that the internal financial control  over financial reporting may become inadequate  because of changes in conditions, or that the degree  of compliance with the policies or procedures may  deteriorate.

G. Highway, Khodiyar, Ahmedabad - 382421, Gujarat, India. Its  shares are listed on the BSE Limited and National Stock Exchange. The Company is in the business of  Trading of Coal and other commodities & Coal Mine Development and Operations (MDO). 2	 Significant Accounting Policies I	 Basis of Preparation a)	 Statement of Compliance The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting  Standards (Ind AS) notified under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Indian  Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended from time to time and other accounting principles generally  accepted in India. These financial statements have been prepared and presented under the historical cost convention with  the exception of certain assets and liabilities that are required to be carried at fair values by Ind AS. Fair  value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction  between the market participants at the measurement date. The financial statements are presented in INR except when otherwise stated. All amounts have been  rounded-off to the nearest crore, unless otherwise indicated and amounts less than H 50,000/- have been  presented as “0.00”. b)	 Use of Estimates and Judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make certain  judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets  and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) and the accompanying disclosures. Future results could  differ due to these estimates and differences between the actual results and the estimates are recognised  in the periods in which the results are known / materialised. Estimates and underlying assumptions are  reviewed on an ongoing basis. 	 Key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting  date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and  liabilities within the next financial year, are described below. Existing circumstances and assumptions about  future developments may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the  control of the Company. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur. Significant estimates and assumptions are required in particular for: i)	 Useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets: This involves determination of the estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible  assets and the assessment as to which components of the cost may be capitalised. Useful life of these  assets is based on the life prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 or based on technical  estimates, taking into account the nature of the asset, estimated usage, expected residual values, anticipated  technological changes, maintenance support and operating conditions of the asset. Management reviews  its estimate of the useful lives of depreciable/ amortisable assets at each reporting date, based on the  expected utility of the assets. Adani Enterprises Limited 262 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 265 ===== Notes forming part of the Financial Statements  for the year ended 31st March, 2022 ii)	 Impairment of Non Financial Asset : Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable  amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The fair value less  costs of disposal calculation is based on available data for similar assets or observable market prices less  incremental costs for disposing of the asset. The value in use calculation is based on a discounted future  cashflows model. The recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used for the discounted future  cashflows model as well as the expected future cash-inflows and the growth rate used. iii)	 Taxes: The Company’s tax jurisdiction is India. Significant judgements are involved in estimating budgeted profits for  the purpose of paying advance tax, determining the provision for income taxes, including amount expected  to be paid/recovered for uncertain tax positions. Significant management judgement is also required to  determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the  level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies, including estimates of temporary  differences reversing on account of available benefits from the Income Tax Act, 1961. iv)	 Fair value measurement of financial instruments: In estimating the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, the Company uses market observable  data to the extent available. Where such Level 1 inputs are not available, the Company establishes appropriate  valuation techniques and inputs to the model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable  markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgment is required in establishing fair  values. Judgments include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes  in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. v)	 Defined benefit plans (Gratuity Benefits): The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan and the present value of the gratuity obligation are determined  using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from  actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary  increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a  defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed  at each reporting date. vi)	 Inventory Measurement Measurement of bulk inventory quantities of coal lying at port/ yards is material, complex and involves  significant judgement and estimate resulting from measuring the surface area. The Company performs  physical counts of above inventory on a periodic basis using internal / external experts to perform volumetric  surveys and assessments, basis which the estimate of quantity for these inventories is determined. The  variations noted between book records and physical quantities of above inventories are evaluated and  appropriately accounted in the books of accounts. vii)	 Determination of lease term & discount rate : Ind AS 116 Leases requires lessee to determine the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease  adjusted with any option to extend or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably certain.  The Company makes assessment on the expected lease term on lease by lease basis and thereby assesses  whether it is reasonably certain that any options to extend or terminate the contract will be exercised. In  evaluating the lease term, the Company considers factors such as any significant leasehold improvements  undertaken over the lease term, costs relating to the termination of lease and the importance of the  underlying to the Company’s operations taking into account the location of the underlying asset and the  availability of the suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods is reassessed to ensure that the  lease term reflects the current economic circumstances. Annual Report 2021-22 263 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 266 ===== The discount rate is generally based on the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease being evaluated  or for a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics. viii)	Asset Retirement Obligation: The liability for asset retirement obligations are recognised when the Company has an obligation to perform  site restoration activity. The recognition and measurement of asset retirement obligations involves the use  of estimates and assumptions, viz. the timing of abandonment of site facilities which would depend upon  the ultimate life of the project, expected utilization of assets in other projects, the scope of abandonment  activity and pre-tax rate applied for discounting. ix)	 Recognition and measurement of Contingent liabilities, provisions and uncertain tax positions: There are various legal, direct and indirect tax matters and other obligations including local and state  levies, availing input tax credits etc., which may impact the Company. Evaluation of uncertain liabilities and  contingent liabilities arising out of above matters and recognition and measurement of other provisions  are based on the assessment of the probability of an outflow of resources, and on past experience and  circumstances known at the balance sheet date. The actual outflow of resources at a future date may  therefore vary from the figure included in other provisions. c)	 Current & Non-Current Classification 	 Any asset or liability is classified as current if it satisfies any of the following conditions: i)	 The asset/liability is expected to be realized/settled in the Company’s normal operating cycle; ii)	 The asset is intended for sale or consumption; iii)	 The asset/liability is held primarily for the purpose of trading; iv)	 The asset/liability is expected to be realized/settled within twelve months after the reporting period; v)	 The asset is cash or cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a  liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date; vi)	 In the case of a liability, the Company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the  liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date. All other assets and liabilities are classified as non-current. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified  as non-current assets and liabilities respectively. For the purpose of current/non-current classification of assets and liabilities, the Company has ascertained  its normal operating cycle as twelve months. This is based on the nature of services and the time between  the acquisition of assets or inventories for processing and their realization in cash and cash equivalents. II	 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies a)	 Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation i)	 Functional and presentation currency The financial statements are presented in Indian Rupee (INR), which is entity’s functional and presentation  currency. ii)	 Transactions and Balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency, for initial recognition, using the  exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. All foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates on the  reporting date. Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised  in Statement of Profit and Loss except to the extent of exchange differences which are regarded as an  Notes forming part of the Financial Statements  for the year ended 31st March, 2022 Adani Enterprises Limited 264 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 267 ===== adjustment to interest costs on foreign currency borrowings that are directly attributable to the acquisition  or construction of qualifying assets which are capitalised as cost of assets. Non-monetary items that are  measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. b)	 Non Current Assets held for Sale and Discontinued Operations The Company classifies assets and operations as held for sale / distribution to owners or as discontinued  operations if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale / distribution rather than  through continuing use. Classification as a discontinued operations occurs upon disposal or when the  operation meets the below criteria, whichever is earlier. 	 Non Current Assets are classified as held for sale only when both the conditions are satisfied – 1. 	 The sale is highly probable, and 2. 	 The asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms  that are usual and customary for sale of such assets. Non-current assets which are subject to depreciation are not depreciated or amortized once those classified  as held for sale. A discontinued operation is a component of the Company’s business, the operations of which can be clearly  distinguished from those of the rest of the Company and i)	 is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area  of operations; or ii)	 is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Non-current assets held for sale / distribution to owners and discontinued operations are measured at the  lower of their carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell / distribute. Assets and liabilities classified  as held for sale / distribution are presented separately in the balance sheet. The results of discontinued  operations are excluded from the overall results of the Company and are presented separately in the  statement of profit and loss. Also, the comparative statement of profit and loss is re-presented as if the  operations had been discontinued from the start of the comparative period. c)	 Cash & Cash Equivalents Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposit with banks. Cash equivalents are short-term balances  (with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition), highly liquid investments  that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of  changes in value. d)	 Property, Plant and Equipment 	 Recognition and Measurement Property, Plant and Equipments, including Capital Work in Progress, are stated at cost of acquisition or  construction less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Cost comprises the purchase  price (net of tax credits, wherever applicable), import duty and other non-refundable taxes or levies and any  directly attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. In case of self- constructed assets, cost includes the costs of all materials used in construction, direct labour and allocation  of overheads. Borrowing cost relating to acquisition / construction of Property, Plant and Equipment which  takes substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use are also included to the extent they  relate to the period till such assets are ready to be put to use. The present value of the expected cost  for the decommissioning of an asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset if the  recognition criteria for a provision are met. If significant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment  have different useful lives, then they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property,  plant and equipment. Notes forming part of the Financial Statements  for the year ended 31st March, 2022 Annual Report 2021-22 265 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 268 ===== 	 Subsequent Measurement Subsequent expenditure related to an item of Property, Plant and Equipment are included in its carrying  amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that the future economic  benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured  reliably. Subsequent costs are depreciated over the residual life of the respective assets. All other expenses  on existing Property, Plant and Equipments, including day-to-day repair and maintenance expenditure and  cost of replacing parts, are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss for the period during which such  expenses are incurred. 	 Capital Work in Progress Expenditure related to and incurred during implementation of capital projects to get the assets ready for  intended use is included under “Capital Work in Progress”. The same is allocated to the respective items of  property plant and equipment on completion of construction/ erection of the capital project/ property plant  and equipment. The cost of asset not ready for its intended use before the year end & capital inventory are  disclosed under capital work in progress. 	 Depreciation Depreciation is provided using straight-line method as specified in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013  or based on technical estimates. Depreciation on assets acquired / disposed off during the year is provided  on pro-rata basis with reference to the date of addition / disposal. 	 Derecognition An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic  benefits are expected to arise from continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or  retirement of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and  the carrying amount of the assets and is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss. e)	 Investment Properties i)	 Property which is held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, is classified as  Investment Property. Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction  costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated  depreciation and accumulated impairment loss, if any. ii)	 The Company depreciates investment properties over their estimated useful lives, as specified in  Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013. iii)	 Investment properties are derecognised either when they have been disposed off or when they are  permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from their disposal. The  difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is recognised in  Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which the property is derecognised. f)	 Intangible Assets i)	 Intangible assets are measured on initial recognition at cost and are subsequently carried at cost  less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Internally generated  intangibles are not capitalised. ii)	 The intangible assets of the Company are assessed to be of finite lives and are amortised over the useful  economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset  may be impaired. The Company reviews amortisation period on an annual basis. Notes forming part of the Financial Statements  for the year ended 31st March, 2022 Adani Enterprises Limited 266 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 269 ===== Notes forming part of the Financial Statements  for the year ended 31st March, 2022 	 	 Intangible assets are amortised on straight line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Intangible Assets Estimated Useful Life (Years) Software applications 3-5 Years based on management estimate Mine Development Assets Over a period of underlying contract 	 Mine Development Assets include expenses pertaining to land and mine development, initial overburden  removal, environmental and other regulatory approvals etc. It represents expenses incurred towards  development of mines where the Company is operating as operator and developer. iii)	 Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between  the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the Statement of  Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised. g)	 Impairment of Non-Financial Assets At the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of non-financial assets,  other than inventories and deferred tax assets to determine whether there is any indication that those  assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset  is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible to  estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount  of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Each CGU represents the smallest group of assets  that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. When  a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to  individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating  units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in  use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that  reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU  for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying  amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment  loss is recognised immediately in statement of profit and loss. Impairment loss recognised in respect of a  CGU is allocated to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets of the CGU (or group of CGUs) on a pro  rata basis. Non Financial Assets (other than goodwill) for which impairment loss has been recognised in prior periods,  the Company reviews at each reporting date whether there is any indication that the loss has decreased  or no longer exists. When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or  a cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the  increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had  no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an  impairment loss is recognised immediately in statement of profit and loss. h)	 Investment in Subsidiaries, Jointly Controlled Entities, Associates and Unincorporated Entities Investment in Subsidiaries, Joint Controlled Entities and Associates are measured at cost less impairment in  accordance with Ind AS 27 ”Separate Financial Statements”. In case of unincorporated entities in the nature of a Joint Operation, the Company recognizes its direct right  and its share of jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint  operations. These have been incorporated in these financial statements under the appropriate headings. Annual Report 2021-22 267 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 270 ===== i)	 Financial Instruments A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability  or equity instrument of another entity. Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly  attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets  and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of  the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly  attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are  recognised immediately in Statement of Profit and Loss. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after  deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognised at the proceeds  received, net of direct issue costs. A)	 Financial Assets 	 Initial Measurement All financial assets, except investment in subsidiaries, associates and joint controlled entities are recognised  initially at fair value. 	 Subsequent Measurement The measurement of financial assets depends on their classification, as described below: 	 1) 	 At amortised cost 	 	 A financial asset is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met : (a)	 The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual  cash flows, and (b)	 Contractual terms of the asset give rise, on specified dates, to cash flows that are solely payments  of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. This category is the most relevant to the Company. After initial measurement, such financial assets are  subsequently measured at amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method. Amortised  cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that  are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the Statement of  Profit and Loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.  This category generally applies to trade and other receivables. 	 2)	 At Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI) A financial asset is classified as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met: (a)	 The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and  selling the financial assets, and (b)	 Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of  principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting  date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognised in the Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) and  on derecognition, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified to Statement of  Profit and Loss. For equity instruments, the Company may make an irrevocable election to present  subsequent changes in the fair value in OCI. If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument  as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognised in the  OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to Statement of Profit and Loss, even on sale of  investment. Notes forming part of the Financial Statements  for the year ended 31st March, 2022 Adani Enterprises Limited 268 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 271 ===== 	 3)	 At Fair Value through Profit & Loss (FVTPL) FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments and default category for equity instruments. Financial  assets included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the  Statement of Profit and Loss. In addition, the Company may elect to designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortised  cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or  eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as ‘accounting mismatch’). 	 	 Derecognition On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum  of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised  in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity is recognised in Statement of Profit and  Loss if such gain or loss would have otherwise been recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss on  disposal of that financial asset. 	 	 Impairment of financial assets The Company applies Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment  loss on the financial assets and credit risk exposure. The Company assesses on a forward looking basis  the expected credit losses associated with its receivables based on historical trends and past experience. The Company follows ‘Simplified Approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on all trade  receivables or contractual receivables. Under the simplified approach the Company does not track  changes in credit risk, but it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each  reporting date, right from its initial recognition. If credit risk has not increased significantly, 12 month  ECL is used to provide for impairment loss. However, if credit risk has increased significantly, lifetime  ECL is used. ECL is the difference between all contracted cash flows that are due to the Company in accordance  with the contract and all the cash flows that the Company expects to receive, discounted at the original  EIR. ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognised during the period is recognised as income  / (expense) in the Statement of Profit and Loss. B)	 Financial Liabilities Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition as at amortised cost or fair value through profit or  loss. The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below: 	 1)	 At amortised cost 	 This is the category most relevant to the Company. After initial recognition, financial liabilities are  subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in  Statement of Profit and Loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation  process. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition  and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs  in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 	 2)	 At fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and  financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as such. Subsequently, any changes in fair value  are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Notes forming part of the Financial Statements  for the year ended 31st March, 2022 Annual Report 2021-22 269 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 272 ===== 	 Derecognition of Financial Liability A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or  expires. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.  An exchange with a lender of debt instruments with substantially different terms is accounted for as an  extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. Similarly, a  substantial modification of the terms of an existing financial liability is accounted for as an extinguishment  of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. C)	 Derivative financial instruments 	 Initial recognition and subsequent measurement The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as forward and options currency contracts to hedge  its foreign currency risks. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and subsequently  measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the  fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivative financial instrument are recognised  in the Statement of Profit and Loss and reported with foreign exchange gains/(loss). Changes in fair value  and gains/(losses) on settlement of foreign currency derivative financial instruments relating to borrowings,  which have not been designated as hedge are recorded as finance cost. j)	 Income Taxes Income tax expense comprises current tax expense and the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability  during the year. Current and deferred taxes are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss, except when  they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which  case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity,  respectively. 	 i)	 Current Tax Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from  or paid to the taxation authorities. Current income tax(including Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT)) is  measured at the amount expected to be paid to the tax authorities in accordance with the Income-Tax  Act, 1961 enacted in India. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are  enacted or substantially enacted, at the reporting date. Current income tax relating to items recognised outside the statement of profit and loss is recognised  outside the statement of profit and loss (either in other comprehensive income (OCI) or in equity).  Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which  applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. 	 ii)	 Deferred Tax Deferred tax is recognised using the Balance Sheet approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are  recognised for deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and  liabilities and their carrying amount, except when the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of  an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither accounting  nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available  against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and  unused tax losses can be utilised. The carrying amount of unrecognised deferred tax assets are reviewed  at each reporting date to assess their realisability and corresponding adjustment is made to carrying  values of deferred tax assets in the financial statements. Notes forming part of the Financial Statements  for the year ended 31st March, 2022 Adani Enterprises Limited 270 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 273 ===== Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year  when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been  enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right exists to offset current  tax assets and liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation  authority. Net outstanding balance in Deferred Tax account is recognized as deferred tax liability/asset. Deferred tax includes MAT tax credit. The Company recognises tax credits in the nature of MAT credit as  an asset only to the extent that there is convincing evidence that the Company will pay normal income  tax during the specified period, i.e., the period for which tax credit is allowed to be carried forward. The  Company reviews the such tax credit asset at each reporting date to assess its recoverability. k)	 Inventories i)	 Inventories are valued at lower of cost or net realisable value. ii)	 Cost of inventories have been computed to include all costs of purchases, cost of conversion, all non- refundable duties & taxes and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and  condition. iii)	 The basis of determining cost for various categories of inventories are as follows: 	 Traded goods	 	 	 	 Weighted Average Cost 	 Stores and Spares	 	 	 Weighted Average Cost iv)	 Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated cost  of completion and estimated cost necessary to make the sale. Necessary adjustment for shortage / excess  stock is given based on the available evidence and past experience of the Company. l)	 Provision, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets Provisions are recognised for when the Company has at present, legal or contractual obligation as a result  of past events, only if it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic outgo or loss will be  required and if the amount involved can be measured reliably. If the effect of the time value of money is  material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks  specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time  is recognised as a finance cost. Contingent liabilities being a possible obligation as a result of past events, the existence of which will be  confirmed only by the occurrence or non occurrence of one or more future events not wholly in control  of the Company are not recognised in the accounts. The nature of such liabilities and an estimate of its  financial effect are disclosed in notes to the financial statements. Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements. the nature of such assets and an estimate  of its financial effect are disclosed in notes to the financial statements. m)	 Revenue Recognition Revenue from contract with customer is recognised upon transfer of control of promised products or  services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive  in exchange for those products or services. Revenue is measured based on the transaction price, which is  the consideration, adjusted for discounts and other incentives, if any, as per contracts with the customers.  Revenue also excludes taxes or amounts collected from customers in its capacity as agent. Notes forming part of the Financial Statements  for the year ended 31st March, 2022 Annual Report 2021-22 271 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 274 ===== The specific recognition criteria from various stream of revenue is described below: 	 (i)	 Sale of Goods Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the control of the goods has been passed to the  customer as per the terms of agreement and there is no continuing effective control or managerial  involvement with the goods. 	 (ii)	 Rendering of Services Revenue from services rendered is recognised when the work is performed and as per the terms of  agreement. 	 (iii)	Dividends Revenue is recognised when the Company’s right to receive the payment is established, which is  generally when shareholders approve the dividend. 	 (iv)	Interest Income Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective  interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through  the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount on initial recognition. 	 (v)	 Profit or Loss on Sale of Investment Profit or Loss on sale of investment is recognised on the contract date. 	 	 Contract Assets A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the  customer. If the Company performs by transferring goods or services to a customer before the customer  pays consideration or before payment is due, a contract asset is recognised for the earned consideration  that is conditional. The same is disclosed as “Unbilled Revenue” under Other Current Financial Assets. 	 	 Trade Receivable A receivable represents the Company’s right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional i.e.  only the passage of time is required before payment of consideration is due. 	 	 Contract Liability A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Company  has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. Contract liabilities  are recognised as revenue when the Company performs under the contract. The same is disclosed as  “Advance from Customers” under Other Current Liabilities. n)	 Employee Benefits Employee benefits includes gratuity, compensated absences, contribution to provident fund, employees’  state insurance and superannuation fund. 	 i)	 Short Term Employee Benefits Employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the services are classified as short  term employee benefits and recognised in the period in which the employee renders the related service.  These are recognised at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for  that service. Notes forming part of the Financial Statements  for the year ended 31st March, 2022 Adani Enterprises Limited 272 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 275 ===== 	 ii)	 Post Employment Benefits 	 	 Defined Contribution Plans Retirement benefits in the form of provident fund and superannuation fund are defined contribution  schemes. The Company has no obligation, other than the contribution payable to the provident fund.  The Company recognises contribution payable to the these funds as an expense, when an employee  renders the related service. 	 	 Defined Benefit Plans The Company operates a defined benefit gratuity plan. The cost of providing benefits under the defined  benefit plan is determined based on actuarial valuation, carried out by an independent actuary, using the  projected unit credit method. The liability for gratuity is funded annually to a gratuity funds maintained  with the Life Insurance Corporation of India and SBI Life Insurance Company Limited. Re-measurements gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial  assumptions are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit  to retained earnings through other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Re- measurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. Net interest is calculated by  applying the discount rate to the net balance of defined benefit liability or asset. The Company recognises the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation as an expense in  the statement of profit and loss in the line item “Employee Benefits Expense”: - Service cost including current service cost, past service cost, gains and losses on curtailments and  non-routine settlements; and - Net interest expense or income. 	 iii)	 Other Long Term Employee Benefits Other long term employee benefits comprise of compensated absences / leaves. The actuarial valuation  is done as per projected unit credit method. Remeasurements as a result of experience adjustments and  changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. iv)	 For the purpose of presentation of defined benefit plans and other long term benefits, the allocation  between current and non-current provisions has been made as determined by an actuary. o)	 Borrowing Costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset  that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised  as part of the cost of the asset. Borrowing costs consist of interest and transaction costs that an entity  incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds. Transaction costs in respect of long-term borrowings  are amortised over the tenor of respective loans using effective interest method. All other borrowing costs  are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Borrowing costs also includes exchange differences  arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing  costs. p)	 Leases The Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at the inception of the contract. A contract is,  or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period  of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of  an identified asset, the Company assesses whether (i) the contract involves the use of identified asset; (ii)  the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset through the period of  lease and (iii) the Company has right to direct the use of the asset. Notes forming part of the Financial Statements  for the year ended 31st March, 2022 Annual Report 2021-22 273 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 276 ===== The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The  right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability  adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs  incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the site on  which it is located, less any lease incentives received. Certain lease arrangements include the option to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease  term. The right-of-use assets and lease liabilities include these options when it is reasonably certain that  the option will be exercised. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement  date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. In  addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain  re-measurements of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the  commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be  readily determined, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Company uses its incremental  borrowing rate as the discount rate. The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is  remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate,  if there is a change in the Company’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual  value guarantee, or if Company changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or  termination option. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying  amount of the right-of-use asset or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use  asset has been reduced to zero. Lease payments have been classified as financing activities in Statement of Cash Flow. The Company has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short term leases  that have a lease term of less than or equal to 12 months with no purchase option and assets with low  value leases. The Company recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense in  statement of profit and loss over the lease term. The related cash flows are classified as operating activities. q)	 Segment Accounting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting to management. For  management purposes, the Company is organised into business units based on its products and services. Operating results of the business units are monitored separately for the purpose of making decisions about  resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on profit or loss  and is measured consistently with the statement of profit or loss in the financial statements. r)	 Earning Per Share Basic EPS is computed by dividing the profit or loss attributable to the equity shareholders of the Company  by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is computed  by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to the ordinary equity shareholders and the weighted average  number of equity shares, for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. Notes forming part of the Financial Statements  for the year ended 31st March, 2022 Adani Enterprises Limited 274 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 277 ===== s)	 Service Work in Progress Service Work in Progress is valued at lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined based on  Weighted Average Cost Method. Service Work in Progress represents closing inventory of Washed and Reject Coal, which is not owned by  the Company as per the terms of Mine Development and Operation (MDO) contract. Hence, this represents  work performed under contractual liability in bringing this inventory to its present condition and location. Net realisable value is the contract price as per the MDO Agreement, less estimated costs of completion and  estimated costs necessary to make the sale. t)	 Overburden Cost Adjustment Overburden removal expenses incurred during production stage are charged to revenue based on waste- to-ore ratio, (commonly known as Stripping Ratio in the industry). This ratio is taken based on the current  operational phase of overall mining area. To the extent the current period ratio exceeds the expected  Stripping Ratio of a phase, excess overburden costs are deferred. u)	 Expenditure Expenses are net of taxes recoverable, where applicable.

The Company’s principal financial  liabilities comprise of borrowings, trade payables, derivative liabilities and other financial liabilities. The  main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Company’s operations and projects. 	 Fair Value Hierarchy : The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that  are either observable or unobservable and consists of the following three levels: Level-1 : Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level-2 : Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level-1 that are observable for the asset or  liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Level-3 : Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined  in whole or in part using a valuation model based on the assumptions that are neither supported by prices  from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market  data.

Annual Report 2021-22 303 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 306 ===== 	 	 A.	 Commodity Price Risk : The Company’s performance is affected by the price volatility of commodities being traded (primarily  coal and also other materials) which are being sourced mainly from international markets. As the  Company is engaged in the on-going purchase or continuous sale of traded goods, it keeps close  monitoring over its purchases to optimise the price. Commodity prices are affected by demand and  supply scenario in the international market, currency exchange fluctuations and taxes levied in  various countries. To mitigate price risk, the Company effectively manages availability of coal as well  as price volatility through widening its sourcing base, appropriate combination of long term and  short term contracts with its vendors and customers and well planned procurement and inventory  strategy. 	 	 B.	 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk : Since the Company operates internationally and portion of the business transacted are carried  out in more than one currency, it is exposed to currency risks through its transactions in foreign  currency or where assets or liabilities are denominated in currency other than functional currency. The company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from foreign currency transactions and  follows established risk management policies including the use of derivatives like foreign exchange  forward and option contracts to hedge exposure to foreign currency risks. For open positions on outstanding foreign currency contracts and details on unhedged foreign  currency exposure, please refer note no. 42. For every percentage point depreciation / appreciation in the exchange rate between the functional  currency and foreign currency, the Company’s profit before tax for the year would increase or  decrease as follows: (H in Crores) Particulars For the year ended  31st March, 2022 For the year ended  31st March, 2021 Impact on profit before tax for the year 38.47 0.83 C.	 Interest Risk : The Company is exposed to changes in interest rates due to its financing, investing and cash  management activities. The risks arising from interest rate movements arise from borrowings with  variable interest rates. The Company manages its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of  fixed and variable rate loans and borrowings. The Company’s risk management activities are subject to the management, direction and control  of Central Treasury Team of the Adani Group under the framework of Risk Management Policy for  interest rate risk. The Group’s Central Treasury Team ensures appropriate financial risk governance  framework for the Company through appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks  are identified, measured and managed in accordance with the Group’s policies and risk objectives. For Company’s floating rate borrowings, the analysis is prepared assuming that the amount of  the liability outstanding at the end of the reporting period was outstanding for the whole year. A  50 basis point increase or decrease is used, which represents management’s assessment of the  reasonably possible change in interest rate.

Financial instruments that are subject to credit risk principally consist  of Loans, Trade and Other Receivables, Cash & Cash Equivalents, Investments and Other Financial  Assets. The carrying amounts of financial assets represent the maximum credit risk exposure. 	 Credit risk encompasses both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness  as well as concentration of risks. Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness  of counter parties on continuous basis with appropriate approval mechanism for sanction of credit  limits. Credit risk from balances with banks, financial institutions and investments is managed by the  Company’s treasury team in accordance with the Company’s risk management policy. Cash and cash  equivalents and Bank Deposits are placed with banks having good reputation, good past track record  and high quality credit rating. 	 Since the Company has a fairly diversified portfolio of receivables in terms of spread, no concentration  risk is foreseen. A significant portion of the Company’s receivables are due from public sector units  (which are government undertakings) and hence may not entail any credit risk.

The Company’s objective is to provide financial resources to  meet its obligations when they are due in a timely, cost effective and reliable manner and to manage its  capital structure. The Company monitors liquidity risk using cash flow forecasting models. These models  consider the maturity of its financial investments, committed funding and projected cash flows from  operations. A balance between continuity of funding and flexibility is maintained through continued  support from trade creditors, lenders and equity contributions.

The counter  party for these contracts is generally a bank. All derivative financial instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and  measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends  on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. The use of derivative instruments  is subject to limits, authorities and regular monitoring by appropriate levels of management. The limits,  authorities and monitoring systems are periodically reviewed by management and the Board. The  market risk on derivatives is mitigated by changes in the valuation of the underlying assets, liabilities or  transactions, as derivatives are used only for risk management purposes. All derivative contracts stated above are for the purpose of hedging the underlying foreign currency  exposure.

Adani Enterprises Limited 310 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 313 ===== Notes forming part of the Financial Statements  for the year ended 31st March, 2022 Aforesaid post-employment benefit plans typically expose the Company to actuarial risks such as: investment  risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and salary risk Investment Risk: These Plans invest in long term debt instruments such as Government securities and highly  rated corporate bonds. The valuation of which is inversely proportionate to the interest  rate movements. There is risk of volatility in asset values due to market fluctuations and  impairment of assets due to credit losses. Interest Risk: The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated using a discount rate  which is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on  Government securities. A decrease in yields will increase the fund liabilities and vice-versa. Longevity Risk: The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated by reference to the best  estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment.  An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability. Salary Risk: The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated by reference to the future  salaries of plan participants.

There is no change in method of valuation for the prior period. 	 (5)	 Maturity Profile of Obligations The weighted average duration of the defined benefit plan obligation at the end of the reporting period is 5  years (31st March 2021: 7 years). The expected maturity analysis of gratuity benefits is as follows :	 	 (H In Crores) Particulars As at  31st March, 2022 As at  31st March, 2021 Within 1 year 4.52 8.83 2 to 5 years 28.22 9.54 6 to 10 years 15.17 9.94 More than 10 years 13.60 33.73 	 (6)	 Asset - Liability Matching Strategies 	 The Company has purchased insurance policy, which is basically a year-on-year cash accumulation plan  in which the interest rate is declared on yearly basis and is guaranteed for a period of one year. The  insurance Company, as part of the policy rules, makes payment of all gratuity outgoes happening during  the year (subject to sufficiency of funds under the policy). Any deficit in the policy assets is funded by  the Company. The policy helps mitigate the liquidity risk. However, being a cash accumulation plan,  the duration of assets is shorter compared to the duration of liabilities. Thus, the Company is exposed  to movement in interest rate (in particular, the significant fall in interest rates, which should result in a  increase in liability without corresponding increase in the asset). 	 (7)	 The company’s expected contribution to the fund in the next financial year is H 9.98 crores (31st March  2021 : H 5.91 crores) 	 (8)	 The estimate of future salary increase, considered in actuarial variation, take account of inflation,  seniority, promotion and other relevant factors, such as supply and demand in the employment market. 47	 Disclosure of transactions with Related Parties, as required by Ind AS 24 “Related Party Disclosures” has  been set out below.

In our opinion and to the best of our information and  according to the explanations given to us and based  on the consideration of the reports of other auditors  referred to below in the Other Matter section below,  the aforesaid Consolidated Financial Statements  give the information required by the Companies Act,  2013 (“the Act”) in the manner so required and give  a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian  Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of  the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting  Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended, (“Ind AS”) and  other accounting principles generally accepted in  India, of the Consolidated state of affairs of the Group  as at 31st March, 2022, the Consolidated profit and  other comprehensive income, Consolidated changes  in equity and its Consolidated cash flows for the year  ended on that date. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit of the Consolidated Financial  Statements in accordance with the Standards on  Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act  (SAs). Our responsibilities under those Standards are  further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for  the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements  section of our report. We are independent of the  Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued  by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India  together with the ethical requirements that are  relevant to our audit of the Consolidated Financial  Statements under the provisions of the Act and the  Rules made there under, and we have fulfilled our  other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these  requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that  the audit evidence we have obtained along with the  consideration of reports of the other auditors referred  to in “Other Matters” section below, is sufficient and  appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on  the Consolidated Financial Statements. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our  professional judgment, were of most significance in  our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements  of the current year. These matters were addressed in  the context of our audit of the Consolidated Financial  Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion  thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on  these matters. Annual Report 2021-22 333 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 336 ===== Sr.  No. Key Audit Matters Auditor’s Response 1 Contingent liabilities relating to taxation,  litigations and arbitrations The provisions and contingent liabilities relate  to ongoing litigations and claims with various  authorities and third parties. These relate to  direct tax, indirect tax, claims and other general  legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course  of business. As at the year ended 31 March  2022, the amounts involved were significant.  The assessment of a provision or a contingent  liability requires significant judgement by the  Management of the Group because of the  inherent complexity in estimating future costs.  The amount recognized as a provision is the  best estimate of the expenditure. The provisions  and contingent liabilities are subject to changes  in the outcomes of litigations and claims and  the positions taken by the Management of the  Group. It involves significant judgement and  estimation to determine the likelihood and  timing of the cash outflows and interpretations  of the legal aspects, tax legislations and  judgements previously made by authorities. Principal Audit Procedures We have obtained an understanding of the process  followed by the Management of the Group for assessment  and determination of the amounts of provisions and  contingent liabilities relating to taxation, litigations and  claims. We have made inquiries about the status in respect  of significant provisions and contingent liabilities  with the Group’s internal tax and legal team, including  challenging the assumptions and critical judgements  made by the Group which impacted the computation of  the provisions and inspecting the computation. We  assessed  Management  conclusions  through  discussions held with their in-house legal counsel  and understanding precedents in similar cases. We  communicated with the group’s external legal counsel  on the certain material litigations to establish the  likelihood of outflow of economic resources being  probable, possible or remote in respect of the litigations. We have involved subject matter experts with specialized  skills and knowledge to assist in the assessment of the  value of significant provisions and contingent liabilities  relating to the pending litigations, on sample basis, in light  of the nature of the exposures, applicable regulations  and related correspondence with the authorities. We also assessed and validated the adequacy and  appropriateness of the disclosures made by the  Management in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2 Timing of Revenue recognition and adjustments  for coal quality variances involving critical  estimates  Material estimation by the Parent is involved in  recognition and measurement of its revenue.  The value and timing of revenue recognition for  sale of goods varies from contract to contract,  and the activity can span beyond the year end.  Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when  control is transferred to the customers and  when there are no other unfulfilled obligations.  This requires detailed analysis of each sale  agreement/ contract /customer purchase order  regarding timing of revenue recognition. Inappropriate assessment could lead to a risk  of revenue being recognized on sale of goods  before the control in the goods is transferred to  the customer. Principal Audit Procedures We have assessed the Parent’s accounting policies for  revenue recognition by comparing with the applicable  accounting standards i.e Ind AS 115; We have conducted testing of design, implementation  and operating effectiveness of key internal financial  controls over timing of recognition of revenue from  sale of goods and subsequent adjustments made to the  transaction price; We have also performed substantive audit procedures  on selected statistical samples of customer contracts.  Verified terms and condition related to acceptance of  goods, acknowledgement on delivery receipts and tested  the transit time to deliver the goods and its revenue  recognition. Our tests of details focused on period end  samples to verify only revenue pertaining to current year  is recognized based on terms and conditions set out in  sale agreements/ contracts and delivery documents.  Adani Enterprises Limited 334 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 337 ===== Sr.  No. Key Audit Matters Auditor’s Response Subsequent adjustments are made to the  transaction price due to grade mismatch/ slippage of the transferred goods (coal). The  variation in the contract price if not settled  mutually between the parties to the contract is  referred to third party testing and the Parent’s  estimates the adjustments required for revenue  recognition pending settlement of such dispute.  Such adjustments in revenue are made on  estimated basis following historical trend. Inappropriate estimation could lead to a risk  of revenue being overvalued or undervalued.  Accordingly, timing of recognition of revenue  and adjustments for coal quality variances  involving critical estimates is a key audit matter. We have assessed the appropriateness of the estimated  adjustments in the process. We also performed tests to  establish the basis of estimation of the consideration  and whether such estimates are commensurate with the  accounting policy of the Parent. We have assessed the adequacy of disclosure in the  Consolidated Financial Statements. 3 Measurement of inventory quantities of coal As at 31st March, 2022 the Parent has coal  inventory of  H  4734.19 crores. This was  determined a key audit matter, as the  measurement of these inventory quantities  lying at the ports/ yards involves significant  judgement  and  estimate  resulting  from  measuring the surface area. The Parent uses  internal and external experts, to perform  volumetric assessments, basis which the  quantity for these inventories is estimated. Principal Audit Procedures We have obtained an understanding and have evaluated  the design and operating effectiveness of controls over  physical count and measurement of such inventory; We have evaluated the competency and capabilities  of Management experts for quantification of the  inventories on sample basis. We have physically observed inventory measurement  and count procedures carried out by Management using  experts, to ensure its appropriateness and completeness;  and Our audit procedures also included obtaining and  inspecting,  inventory  measurement  and  physical  count results for such inventories, including assessing  and evaluating the results of analysis performed by  Management in respect of differences between book  and physical quantities. We have also verified that  the physical verification differences are appropriately  accounted for in the books of accounts. 4 Business Combinations During the year, the Group has acquired  substantial stake in GVK Airport Developers  Limited resulting in the acquisition of Mumbai  International Airports Limited (“MIAL”) Group for  a cash consideration of H 5,572.38 crores. The  Group accounted for the acquisitions under the  acquisition method of accounting for business  combinations. Accordingly, the purchase price  was allocated to the assets acquired (including  identifiable intangible assets and investments  in subsidiaries and Joint ventures) and liabilities  (including contingent liabilities, if any) assumed  based on their fair values on their respective  acquisition dates. Principal Audit Procedures We tested the Design, Implementation and Operating  effectiveness of controls over the purchase price  allocation process. We evaluated the appropriateness of the valuation  methodologies  for  identified  intangibles  and  reasonableness of the valuation assumptions viz.  discount rate / contributory asset charge, as applicable  discount rate, including testing the source information  underlying the determination of the discount rate,  testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation,  and developing a range of independent estimates  and comparing those to the discount rate selected by  independent valuers and relied upon by the Management. Annual Report 2021-22 335 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 338 ===== Sr.  No. Key Audit Matters Auditor’s Response The determination of such fair values for the  purpose of purchase price allocation was  considered to be a key focus area of our audit  as the fair valuation process involves judgments  and estimates such as appropriateness of the  valuation methodology applied and the discount  rates applied to future cash flow forecasts. We evaluated the competencies, capabilities and  objectivity of the independent valuers engaged by the  Group’s Management for value analysis of tangible and  intangible assets. Information other than the Financial Statements  and Auditor’s Report thereon The Parent Company’s Management and Board of  Directors are responsible for the other information.  The other information comprises the information  included in the Management Discussion and Analysis,  Board’s Report including Annexures to Board’s  Report, Business Responsibility Report, Corporate  Governance and Shareholder’s Information, but does  not include the Consolidated Financial Statements,  Standalone Financial Statements and our auditors’  report thereon. Our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements  does not cover the other information and we do not  express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the Consolidated  Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read  the other information, compare with the Financial  Statements of the subsidiaries, associates and jointly  controlled entities audited by the other auditors, to  the extent it relates to these entities and, in doing so,  consider whether the other information is materially  inconsistent  with  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or  otherwise appears to be materially misstated. Other  information so far as it relates to the subsidiaries,  associates and jointly controlled entities, is traced  from its Financial Statements audited by the other  auditors or certified by the Management. If, based on  the work we have performed, we conclude that there  is a material misstatement of this other information;  we are required to report that fact. We have nothing  to report in this regard. Management’s  and  Board  of  Director’s  Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial  Statements The Parent Company’s Management and the Board  of Directors are responsible for the matters stated in  Section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)  with respect to the preparation and presentation of  these Consolidated Financial Statements that give  a true and fair view of the consolidated financial  position,  consolidated  financial  performance  including other comprehensive income, consolidated  cash flows and consolidated changes in equity of the  Group, its associates and jointly controlled entities in  accordance with the accounting principles generally  accepted in India, including the applicable Indian  Accounting Standards (Ind AS) prescribed under  Section 133 of the Act, read with the Companies  (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as  amended. The respective Management and the Board of  Directors of the companies included in the Group  and its associates and jointly controlled entities are  responsible maintenance of adequate accounting  records in accordance with the provisions of the Act  for safeguarding the assets of the Group its associates  and jointly controlled entities and for preventing  and detecting frauds and other irregularities;  selection and application of appropriate accounting  policies; making judgments and estimates that are  reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation  and maintenance of adequate internal financial  controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring  the accuracy and completeness of the accounting  records, relevant to the preparation and presentation  of the Consolidated Financial Statements that  give a true and fair view and are free from material  misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which  have been used for the purpose of preparation of the  Consolidated Financial Statements by the Board of  Directors of the Group, as aforesaid. In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements,  the Management and the Boards of Directors of  the companies included in the Group its associates  and jointly controlled entities are responsible for  assessing the ability of the respective entities to  continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,  matters related to going concern and using the going  concern basis of accounting unless Management  either intends to liquidate or to cease operations, or  has no realistic alternative but to do so. Adani Enterprises Limited 336 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 339 ===== The respective Boards of Directors of the companies  included in the Group are also responsible for  overseeing the financial reporting process of the  Group its associates and jointly controlled entities. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the  Consolidated Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance  about whether the Consolidated Financial Statements  as a whole are free from material misstatement,  whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an  auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable  assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a  guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance  with SAs will always detect a material misstatement  when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or  error and are considered material if, individually or in  the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to  influence the economic decisions of users taken on  the basis of these Consolidated Financial Statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise  professional judgment and maintain professional  scepticism throughout the audit. We also: 	 Identify and assess the risks of material  misstatement of the Consolidated Financial  Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design  and perform audit procedures responsive to those  risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient  and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.  The risk of not detecting a material misstatement  resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting  from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,  intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the  override of internal control. 	 Obtain an understanding of internal financial  controls relevant to the audit in order to design  audit procedures that are appropriate in the  circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act,  we are also responsible for expressing our opinion  on whether the Parent Company has adequate  internal financial controls system in place and the  operating effectiveness of such controls. 	 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of  accounting estimates and related disclosures  made by Management. 	 Conclude  on  the  appropriateness  of  Management’s use of the going concern basis  of accounting and, based on the audit evidence  obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists  related to events or conditions that may cast  significant doubt on the ability of the Group, its  associates and its jointly controlled entities to  continue as a going concern. If we conclude that  a material uncertainty exists, we are required  to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the  related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial  Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate,  to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based  on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of  our auditor’s report. However, future events or  conditions may cause the Group its associates  and its jointly controlled entities to cease to  continue as a going concern. 	 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure  and content of the Consolidated Financial  Statements,  including  the  disclosures,  and  whether the Consolidated Financial Statements  represent the underlying transactions and events  in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 	 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence  regarding the financial information of the  entities or business activities within the Group,  its associates and its jointly controlled entities to  express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial  Statements. We are responsible for the direction,  supervision and performance of the audit of the  Financial Statements of such entities included in  the Consolidated Financial Statements of which  we are the independent auditors. For the other  entities included in the Consolidated Financial  statements, which have been audited by other  auditors, such other auditors remain responsible  for the financial information provided to us. We  remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.  Our responsibilities in this regard are further  described in the section titled “Other Matters” in  this audit report. We communicate with those charged with governance  of the Parent Company and such other entities  included in the Consolidated Financial Statements  of which we are the independent auditors regarding,  among other matters, the planned scope and timing  of the audit and significant audit findings, including  any significant deficiencies in internal control that  we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with  a statement that we have complied with relevant  ethical requirements regarding independence, and to  communicate with them all relationships and other  matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on  our independence, and where applicable, related  safeguards. Annual Report 2021-22 337 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 340 ===== From the matters communicated with those charged  with governance, we determine those matters  that were of most significance in the audit of the  Consolidated Financial Statements of the current  period and are therefore the key audit matters. We  describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless  law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the  matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we  determine that a matter should not be communicated  in our report because the adverse consequences of  doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh  the public interest benefits of such communication. Other Matters (i)	 The  accompanying  Consolidated  Financial  Statements include the Group’s proportionate  share in jointly controlled net assets of H 120.73  crores in respect of 2 Unincorporated Jointly  Controlled Entities not operated by the Group,  which is based on unaudited statements which  have been certified by the Management and  relied upon by us.

In our opinion, to the best of our information and  according to the explanations given to us and based  on the consideration of reports of the other auditors,  as referred to in Other Matters paragraph, the Group,  its associates and jointly controlled entities, which are  companies incorporated in India, have maintained, in  all material respects, an adequate internal financial  controls system over financial reporting and such  internal financial controls over financial reporting  were operating effectively as at 31st March, 2022, based  on the internal control over financial reporting criteria  established by the Parent Company considering the  essential components of internal control stated in the  Guidance Note issued by the ICAI. Management’s Responsibilities for Internal  Financial Controls The respective Board of Directors or management of  the Companies, which are companies incorporated  in India, are responsible for establishing and  maintaining internal financial controls based on  the internal control over financial reporting criteria  established by the respective Companies considering  the essential components of internal control stated  in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial  Controls over Financial Reporting (the ‘Guidance  Note’) issued by the ICAI. These responsibilities  include the design, implementation and maintenance  of adequate internal financial controls that were  operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and  efficient conduct of its business, including adherence  to respective Company’s policies, the safeguarding  of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds  and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the  accounting records, and the timely preparation of  reliable financial information, as required under the  Act. Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the  internal financial controls over financial reporting  of the Parent Company, its subsidiaries, associates  and jointly controlled entities, which are companies  incorporated in India, based on our audit. We  conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance  Note and the Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI and  deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the  Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an  audit of internal financial controls, both applicable to  an audit of Internal Financial Controls and both issued  by the ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note  require that we comply with ethical requirements  and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether adequate internal financial  controls over financial reporting was established and  maintained and if such controls operated effectively  in all material respects. Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain  audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal  financial controls system over financial reporting and  their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal  financial controls over financial reporting included  obtaining an understanding of internal financial  controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk  that a material weakness exists, and testing and  evaluating the design and operating effectiveness  of internal control based on the assessed risk.  The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s  judgment, including the assessment of the risks of  material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial  Statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained  and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors  in terms of their reports referred to in the Other  Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate  to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal  financial controls system over financial reporting  Adani Enterprises Limited 344 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 347 ===== of the Parent Company, its subsidiaries, associates  and jointly controlled entities, which are companies  incorporated in India. Other Matters 1.	 Our report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act  on the adequacy and operating effectiveness  of the internal financial controls over financial  reporting of the Parent Company, its subsidiaries,  associates and jointly controlled entities, which  are companies incorporated in India, in so far  as it relates to separate financial statements  of 79 subsidiaries 3 Jointly Controlled entities  and 2 associates is based on the corresponding  reports of the auditors of such subsidiaries and  associates, which are companies incorporated in  India. 2.	 We do not comment on the adequacy and  operating effectiveness of the internal financial  controls over financial reporting of 2 subsidiaries,  5 associates and 2 Jointly controlled entities  incorporated in India, whose financial statements  are unaudited and have been furnished to us by  the Management. 3.	 We further draw attention to Note 49 of the  accompanied Consolidated Financial Statements,  where in case of one subsidiary, certain  investigations and enquiries are pending. The  implication on adequacy of subsidiary’s internal  financial control and the operational effectiveness  of such control, if any, would be known only after  the investigations are concluded. The component  auditors of this subsidiary have qualified their  opinion in this regard. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over  Financial Reporting A Company’s internal financial control over financial  reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable  assurance regarding the reliability of financial  reporting and the preparation of Financial Statements  for external purposes in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles. A Company’s internal  financial control over financial reporting includes  those policies and procedures that: (1) 	 pertain to the maintenance of records that, in  reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the  transactions and dispositions of the assets of the  Company; (2) 	provide reasonable assurance that transactions  are recorded as necessary to permit preparation  of Financial Statements in accordance with  generally accepted accounting principles, and  that receipts and expenditures of the Company  are being made only in accordance with  authorizations of Management and directors of  the Company; and (3) 	provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention or timely detection of unauthorized  acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s  assets that could have a material effect on the  Financial Statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial  Controls over Financial Reporting Because of the inherent limitations of internal  financial controls over financial reporting, including  the possibility of collusion or improper Management  override of controls, material misstatements due to  error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also,  projections of any evaluation of the internal financial  controls over financial reporting to future periods are  subject to the risk that the internal financial control  over financial reporting may become inadequate  because of changes in conditions, or that the degree  of compliance with the policies or procedures may  deteriorate.

Basis of Preparation 	 a)	 Statement of Compliance The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Indian  Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with  the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended from time to time and other  accounting principles generally accepted in India. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared and presented under the historical cost  convention with the exception of certain assets and liabilities that are required to be carried at fair  values by Ind AS. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a  liability in an orderly transaction between the market participants at the measurement date. The financial statements are presented in INR except when otherwise stated. All amounts have been  rounded-off to the nearest Crore, unless otherwise indicated and amounts less than H 50,000/- have  been presented as “0.00”. 	 b)	 Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries  and equity accounting of its investment in associates and jointly controlled entities. Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions  and other events in similar circumstances. If a member of the group uses accounting policies other  than those adopted in the consolidated financial statements, appropriate adjustments are made to  that group member’s financial statements in preparing the consolidated financial statements to ensure  conformity with the group’s accounting policies. The financial statements of all the entities used for the purpose of consolidation are drawn up to same  reporting date as that of the parent company. When the end of the reporting period of the parent is  different from that of a subsidiary, jointly controlled entities or associate, the respective entity prepares,  for consolidation purposes, additional financial information as of the same date as the financial  statements of the parent to enable the parent to consolidate the financial information of the said entity,  unless it is impracticable to do so. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the following basis. 	 	 Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the  Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its power and involvement with the investee and  has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Annual Report 2021-22 353 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 356 ===== Subsidiaries are considered for consolidation when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and  are derecognised when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Subsidiaries have been consolidated  on a line-by-line basis by adding together the book values of the like items of assets, liabilities, equity,  income and expenses. Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains resulting on intra- group transactions are eliminated in full. Unrealised losses resulting from intra-group transactions  are eliminated in arriving at the carrying amount of assets unless transaction provides an evidence of  impairment of transferred asset. Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets not held by the Group  and are presented separately in the Statement of Profit and Loss and Consolidated Balance Sheet,  separately from parent shareholders’ equity, profit and loss and each component of other comprehensive  income (OCI) are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling  interests, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. Changes in the Group’s ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the Group losing control  over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the Group’s  interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests  in the subsidiaries. 	 	 Associates and Jointly Controlled Entities - Equity Accounting An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the  power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or  joint control over those policies. A jointly controlled entity is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the  arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint arrangement. Joint control is the contractually  agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant  activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The results and assets and liabilities of associates and jointly controlled entities are incorporated  in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity  method, an investment in an associate or a jointly controlled entity is initially recognised at cost and  adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group’s share of post acquisition profits or losses and that of  other comprehensive income of the associate or jointly controlled entity. Distributions received from  an associate or a jointly controlled entity reduce the carrying amount of the investment. Unrealised  gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group, Jointly Controlled Entity and Associate  entities are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the Jointly Controlled Entity and Associate entities. After application of the equity method, at each reporting date, the Group determines whether there is  objective evidence that the investment in the associate or jointly controlled entity is impaired. If there  exists such evidence, the Group determines extent of impairment and then recognises the loss in the  Statement of Profit and Loss. Upon loss of significant influence over the associate or joint control over the jointly controlled entity,  the Group measures and recognises any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference between  the carrying amount of the associate or the jointly controlled entity and the fair value of the retained  investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in profit and loss. 	 	 Unincorporated Entities In case of unincorporated entities in the nature of a Joint Operation, the Group recognizes its direct right  and its share of jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, revenues and expenses  of joint operations. These have been incorporated in these financial statements under the appropriate  headings.

Future results  could differ due to these estimates and differences between the actual results and the estimates are  recognised in the periods in which the results are known / materialised. Estimates and underlying  assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. 	 	 Key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the  reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts  of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below. Existing circumstances and  assumptions about future developments may change due to market changes or circumstances arising  that are beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they  occur. 	 	 Significant estimates and assumptions are required in particular for: 	 	 i) 	 Useful life of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets: This involves determination of the estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment and  intangible assets and the assessment as to which components of the cost may be capitalised. Useful  life of these assets is based on the life prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 or based  on technical estimates, taking into account the nature of the asset, estimated usage, expected  residual values, anticipated technological changes, maintenance support and operating conditions  of the asset. Management reviews its estimate of the useful lives of depreciable/ amortisable assets  at each reporting date, based on the expected utility of the assets. 	 	 ii) 	 Impairment of Non Financial Asset : Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable  amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. The fair value  less costs of disposal calculation is based on available data for similar assets or observable market  prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset. The value in use calculation is based on a  discounted future cashflows model. The recoverable amount is sensitive to the discount rate used  for the discounted future cashflows model as well as the expected future cash-inflows and the  growth rate used. iii)	 Taxes: Significant judgements are involved in estimating budgeted profits for the purpose of paying  advance tax, determining the provision for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid/ recovered for uncertain tax positions. Significant management judgement is also required to  determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing  Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended 31st March, 2022 Annual Report 2021-22 365 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 368 ===== and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies, including  estimates of temporary differences reversing on account of available benefits from the tax laws  applicable to respective entities. iv) Fair value measurement of financial instruments: In estimating the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, the Group uses market  observable data to the extent available. Where such Level 1 inputs are not available, the Group  establishes appropriate valuation techniques and inputs to the model. The inputs to these models  are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of  judgment is required in establishing fair values. Judgments include considerations of inputs such  as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect  the reported fair value of financial instruments. v) Defined benefit plans: The cost of the defined benefit plan and the present value of the obligation are determined using  actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ  from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate,  future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its  long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions.  All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. vi) Inventory Measurement Measurement of bulk inventory lying at ports/ yards is material, complex and involves significant  judgement and estimate resulting from measuring the surface area. The Group performs physical  counts of above inventory on a periodic basis using internal / external experts to perform volumetric  surveys and assessments, basis which the estimate of quantity for these inventories is determined.  The variations noted between book records and physical quantities of above inventories are  evaluated and appropriately accounted in the books of accounts. vii)	 Determination of lease term & discount rate : Ind AS 116 Leases requires lessee to determine the lease term as the non-cancellable period of  a lease adjusted with any option to extend or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is  reasonably certain. The Group makes assessment on the expected lease term on lease by lease  basis and thereby assesses whether it is reasonably certain that any options to extend or terminate  the contract will be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the Group considers factors such as  any significant leasehold improvements undertaken over the lease term, costs relating to the  termination of lease and the importance of the underlying to the Group’s operations taking into  account the location of the underlying asset and the availability of the suitable alternatives.  The lease term in future periods is reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the current  economic circumstances. The discount rate is generally based on the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease being  evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics. viii) Asset Retirement Obligation : The liability for asset retirement obligations are recognised when the Group has an obligation to  perform site restoration activity. The recognition and measurement of asset retirement obligations  involves the use of estimates and assumptions, viz. the timing of abandonment of site facilities  which would depend upon the ultimate life of the project, expected utilization of assets in other  Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended 31st March, 2022 Adani Enterprises Limited 366 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 369 ===== projects, the scope of abandonment activity and pre-tax rate applied for discounting. ix) 	Recognition and measurement of Contingent liabilities, provisions and uncertain tax positions: There are various legal, direct and indirect tax matters and other obligations including local and  state levies, availing input tax credits etc., which may impact the Group. Evaluation of uncertain  liabilities and contingent liabilities arising out of above matters and recognition and measurement  of other provisions are based on the assessment of the probability of an outflow of resources, and  on past experience and circumstances known at the balance sheet date. The actual outflow of  resources at a future date may therefore vary from the figure included in other provisions. 	 d)	 Current & Non-Current Classification 	 	 Any asset or liability is classified as current if it satisfies any of the following conditions : i)	 The asset/liability is expected to be realised/settled in the Group’s normal operating cycle; ii)	 The asset is intended for sale or consumption; iii)	 The asset/liability is held primarily for the purpose of trading; iv)	 The asset/liability is expected to be realised/settled within twelve months after the reporting period; v)	 The asset is cash or cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a  liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date; vi)	 In the case of a liability, the Group does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the  liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date. All other assets and liabilities are classified as non-current. Deferred tax assets & liabilities are classified  as non-current assets & liabilities respectively. For the purpose of current/non-current classification of assets and liabilities, the Group has ascertained  its normal operating cycle as twelve months. This is based on the nature of services and the time  between the acquisition of assets or inventories for processing and their realisation in cash and cash  equivalents. II	 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 	 a)	 Foreign Currency Transactions and Translations 	 	 i)	 Functional and Presentation Currency The financial statements are presented in Indian Rupee (INR), which is the functional and  presentation currency of the parent company. 	 	 ii) 	 Transactions and Balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency, for initial recognition,  using the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. All foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange  rates on the reporting date. Exchange differences arising on settlement or translation of monetary  items are recognised in statement of profit and loss except to the extent of exchange differences  Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended 31st March, 2022 Annual Report 2021-22 367 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 370 ===== which are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on foreign currency borrowings that are  directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets which are capitalised  as cost of assets. Additionally, all exchange gains or losses on foreign currency borrowings taken  prior to 1st April, 2016 which are related to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are  adjusted in the carrying cost of such assets. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of  historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. 	 	 iii)	 Group Companies On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the exchange rate  prevailing at the reporting date and their statements of profit and loss are translated using average  rate of exchange prevailing during the year, which approximates to the exchange rate prevailing  at the transaction date. All resulting exchange differences arising on translation for consolidation  are recognised in OCI. On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of OCI relating to that  particular foreign operation is reclassified / recognised in the statement of profit and loss. 	 b)	 Non Current Assets held for Sale and Discontinued Operations The Group classifies assets and operations as held for sale / distribution to owners or as discontinued  operations if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale / distribution rather  than through continuing use. Classification as a discontinued operations occurs upon disposal or when  the operation meets the below criteria whichever earlier. Non Current Assets are classified as held for sale only when both the conditions are satisfied – 1.	 The sale is highly probable, and 2.	 The asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to  terms that are usual and customary for sale of such assets. Non-current assets which are subject to depreciation are not depreciated or amortized once those  classified as held for sale. A discontinued operation is a component of the Group’s business, the operations of which can be clearly  distinguished from those of the rest of the Group and i) 	 is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical  area of operations; or ii) 	 is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Non-current assets held for sale / distribution to owners and discontinued operations are measured at  the lower of their carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell / distribute. Assets and liabilities  classified as held for sale / distribution are presented separately in the balance sheet. The results of  discontinued operations are excluded from the overall results of the Group and are presented separately  in the statement of profit and loss. Also, the comparative statement of profit and loss is re-presented as  if the operations had been discontinued from the start of the comparative period. 	 c)	 Cash & Cash Equivalents Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposit with banks. Cash equivalents are short-term balances  (with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition), highly liquid investments  that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of  changes in value. 	 d)	 Property, Plant and Equipment 	 	 Recognition and Measurement Property, Plant and Equipment, including Capital Work in Progress, are stated at cost of acquisition or  Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended 31st March, 2022 Adani Enterprises Limited 368 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 371 ===== construction less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Cost comprises the purchase  price (net of tax credits, wherever applicable), import duty and other non-refundable taxes or levies and  any directly attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. In case  of self-constructed assets, cost includes the costs of all materials used in construction, direct labour,  allocation of overheads. Borrowing cost relating to acquisition / construction of Property, Plant and  Equipment which takes substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use are also included  to the extent they relate to the period till such assets are ready to be put to use. The present value  of the expected cost for the decommissioning of an asset after its use is included in the cost of the  respective asset if the recognition criteria for a provision are met. If significant parts of an item of  property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, then they are accounted for as separate items  (major components) of property, plant and equipment. 	 	 Subsequent Measurement Subsequent expenditure related to an item of Property, Plant and Equipment are included in its carrying  amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that the future  economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be  measured reliably. Subsequent costs are depreciated over the residual life of the respective assets. All  other expenses on existing Property, Plant and equipment, including day-to-day repair and maintenance  expenditure and cost of replacing parts, are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss for the period  during which such expenses are incurred. Capital Work in Progress Expenditure related to and incurred during implementation of capital projects to get the assets ready  for intended use is included under “Capital Work in Progress”. The same is allocated to the respective  items of property plant and equipment on completion of construction/ erection of the capital project/  property plant and equipment. The cost of asset not ready for its intended use before the year end &  capital inventory are disclosed under Capital work in progress. Depreciation Depreciation is provided using straight-line method as specified in Schedule II to the Companies Act,  2013 or based on technical estimates. Depreciation on assets acquired / disposed off during the year is  provided on pro-rata basis with reference to the date of addition / disposal. Derecognition An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic  benefits are expected to arise from continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or  retirement of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds  and the carrying amount of the assets and is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Oil & Gas assets : Expenditure incurred prior to obtaining the right(s) to explore, develop and produce oil and gas are  expensed off in the year of incurrence to the extent of the efforts not successful. Expenditure incurred  on the acquisition of the license are initially capitalised on a license by license basis. Costs including  indirect cost incurred for the block are held, undepleted within “Capital Work in Progress” until the  exploration phase relating to the license area is complete or commercial oil and gas reserves have been  discovered. Indirect costs are expensed off in the year of incurrence. Exploratory/appraisal drilling costs are initially capitalised within “Capital Work in Progress” on a block  by block basis until the success or otherwise of the block is established. The success or failure of each  exploration/appraisal effort is judged on a block basis. Where results of seismic studies or exploration drilling indicate the presence of oil and gas reserves  Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended 31st March, 2022 Annual Report 2021-22 369 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 372 ===== which are ultimately not considered commercially recoverable and no additional exploratory activity  is firmly planned, all related costs are written off to the Statement of Profit and Loss in the year of  cessation of the exploration activity. Any payment made towards fulfilment of commitment under the contracts from earlier periods  continues to be included under Exploration and Evaluation Assets at its carried value in accordance  with Ind AS 101. Exploration and Evaluation assets : Exploration and evaluation expenditure comprises cost that are directly attributable to : - 	 Cost of acquiring mining and exploration tenements; - 	 Research and analysing historical exploration data; - 	 Conducting topographical, geochemical and geophysical studies; - 	 Conducting exploratory drilling, trenching and sampling; - 	 Examining and testing extraction and treatment methods; and/or - 	 Compiling prefeasibility and feasibility studies. Exploration expenditure relates to the initial search for mineral deposits with economic potential.  Evaluation expenditure arises from detailed assessment of deposits or other projects that have been  identified as having economic potential. Exploration and evaluation expenditure is charged to Statement of Profit and Loss as incurred unless  the directors are confident of the project’s technical and commercial feasibility and it is probable that  economic benefits will flow to the Group, in which case expenditure may be capitalised. Capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is treated as a tangible asset and is recorded at  cost less any accumulated impairment charges. No amortisation is charged during the exploration and  evaluation phase as the assets is not available for use. 	 e)	 Investment Property i)	 Property which is held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, is classified  as Investment Property. Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction  costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated  depreciation and accumulated impairment loss, if any. ii)	 The Group depreciates investment properties over their estimated useful lives as specified in  Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013. iii)	 Investment properties are derecognised / transferred when they have been disposed off, have been  used for own purpose of the Company or when they have permanently withdrawn from use and no  future economic benefit is expected from their disposal. The difference between the net disposal  proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss in the  period in which the property is derecognised. 	 f)	 Intangible Assets i)	 Intangible assets are measured on initial recognition at cost and are subsequently carried at cost  less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Internally generated  intangibles are not capitalised. ii)	 The intangible assets of the Group are assessed to be of finite lives and are amortised over the useful  economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset  Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended 31st March, 2022 Adani Enterprises Limited 370 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 373 ===== may be impaired. The Group reviews amortisation period on an annual basis. 	 	 Intangible assets are amortised on straight line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Intangible Assets Estimated Useful Life (Years) Software applications 3-5 Years based on management estimate Mine Development Assets Over a period of underlying contract Mine Development Assets include expenses pertaining to land and mine development, initial overburden  removal, environmental and other regulatory approvals etc. It represents expenses incurred towards  development of mines where the Company is operating as operator and developer. iii)	 Expenditure incurred during development of intangible assets is included under “Intangible  Assets under Development”. The same is allocated to the respective items of intangible assets on  completion of the project. iv)	 Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference  between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the  Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised. 	 g)	 Impairment of Non-Financial Assets i)	 At the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of non-financial assets,  other than inventories and deferred tax assets to determine whether there is any indication that  those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount  of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). When it  is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the  recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Each CGU represents  the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash  inflows of other assets or CGUs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be  identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they  are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent  allocation basis can be identified. ii)	 Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing  value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax  discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks  specific to the asset or CGU for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. iii)	 If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its  carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount.  An impairment loss is recognised immediately in statement of profit and loss. Impairment loss  recognised in respect of a CGU is allocated to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets of  the CGU (or group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis. iv)	 Assets (other than goodwill) for which impairment loss has been recognised in prior periods, the  Group reviews at each reporting date whether there is any indication that the loss has decreased  or no longer exists. When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the  asset (or a cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but  so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been  determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior  years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in statement of profit and loss. 	 h)	 Service Concession Arrangements Service Concession Arrangements (SCA) refers to an arrangement between the grantor (a public sector  entity) and the operator (a private sector entity) to provide services that give the public access to major  economic and social facilities utilising private sector funds and expertise. Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended 31st March, 2022 Annual Report 2021-22 371 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 374 ===== With respect to SCA, revenue and costs are allocated between those relating to construction services and  those relating to operation and maintenance services, and accounted for separately. The infrastructure  used in a concession are classified as an intangible asset or a financial asset, depending on the nature  of the payment entitlements under the SCA. When the Company has an unconditional right to receive  cash or another financial asset from or at the direction of the grantor, such right is recognised as a  financial asset and is subsequently measured at amortised cost. When the demand risk is with the  Group and it has right to charge the user for use of facility, the right is recognised as an intangible  asset and is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. The  intangible assets are amortised over a period of service concession arrangements. 	 i)	 Government Grants Government grants are recognised at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grant  will be received and all attached conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is deferred and recognised as income in the Statement of  Profit and Loss on a systematic basis over the periods necessary to match the related costs, which they  are intended to compensate. When the grant relates to an asset or a non-monetary item, it is recognised as deferred income under  liabilities and is recognised as income in the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight line basis over  the expected useful life of the related asset or a non-monetary item. 	 j)	 Financial Instruments A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial  liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are  directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than  financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted  from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition.  Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair  value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in Statement of Profit and Loss. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after  deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by a Group entity are recognised at the proceeds  received, net of direct issue costs. 	 A)	 Financial Assets All financial assets, except investment in subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities are  recognised initially at fair value. The measurement of financial assets depends on their classification, as described below: 	 	 1) 	 At amortised cost 	 A financial asset is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met : (a) 	The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting  contractual cash flows, and (b) 	Contractual terms of the asset give rise, on specified dates, to cash flows that are solely  payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. This category is the most relevant to the Group. After initial measurement, such financial assets are  subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised  cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs  Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended 31st March, 2022 Adani Enterprises Limited 372 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 375 ===== that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the  Statement of Profit and Loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the profit or  loss. This category generally applies to trade and other receivables. 	 	 2) 	 At fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) 	 	 	 A financial asset is classified as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met: (a) 	The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and  selling the financial assets, and (b) 	Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments  of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each  reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognised in the other comprehensive income  (OCI) and on derecognition, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified to  Statement of Profit and Loss. For equity instruments, the Group may make an irrevocable election  to present subsequent changes in the fair value in OCI. If the Group decides to classify an equity  instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are  recognised in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to the Statement of Profit and  Loss, even on sale of investment. 	 	 3) 	 At fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments and default category for equity instruments.  Financial assets included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes  recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. In addition, the Group may elect to designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortised  cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or  eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as ‘accounting mismatch’). 	 	 	 Derecognition On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the  sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been  recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity is recognised in profit or  loss if such gain or loss would have otherwise been recognised in profit or loss on disposal of that  financial asset. 	 	 	 Impairment of Financial Assets The Group applies Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of  impairment loss on the financial assets and credit risk exposure. The Group assesses on a forward  looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its receivables based on historical trends  and past experience. The Group follows ‘Simplified Approach’ for recognition of impairment loss allowance on all trade  receivables or contractual receivables. Under the simplified approach, the Group does not track  changes in credit risk, but it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each  reporting date, right from its initial recognition. If credit risk has not increased significantly, 12  month ECL is used to provide for impairment loss. However, if credit risk has increased significantly,  lifetime ECL is used. Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended 31st March, 2022 Annual Report 2021-22 373 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 376 ===== ECL is the difference between all contracted cash flows that are due to the Group in accordance  with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at the  original EIR. ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) recognised during the period is recognised  as income / (expense) in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 	 B)	 Financial Liabilities Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition as at amortised cost or fair value through profit or  loss. The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below: 	 	 At amortised cost This is the category most relevant to the Group. After initial recognition, financial liabilities are  subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in  Statement of Profit and Loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation  process. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition  and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs  in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 	 	 At fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and  financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as such. Subsequently, any changes in fair value  are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 	 	 Derecognition of Financial Liability A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or  expires. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the Statement of Profit and  Loss. An exchange with a lender of debt instruments with substantially different terms is accounted for  as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.  Similarly, a substantial modification of the terms of an existing financial liability is accounted for as an  extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. 	 C)	 Derivative financial instruments 	 	 Initial recognition and subsequent measurement The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward and options currency contracts to  hedge its foreign currency risks. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and  subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). Derivatives are carried as financial  assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivative financial instrument are recognised  in the Statement of Profit and Loss and reported with foreign exchange gains/(loss) not within results  from operating activities. Changes in fair value and gains/(losses) on settlement of foreign currency  derivative financial instruments relating to borrowings, which have not been designated as hedge are  recorded as finance expense. 	 k)	 Income Taxes Income tax expense comprises current tax expense and the net change in the deferred tax asset or  liability during the year. Current and deferred taxes are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss,  except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in  equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income  or directly in equity, respectively. 	 	 i)	 Current Income Tax Provision for current tax is measured at the amount of tax expected to be payable on the taxable  Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended 31st March, 2022 Adani Enterprises Limited 374 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 377 ===== income for the year as determined in accordance with the provisions of the tax laws of the concerned  jurisdiction. Current income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be  recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute  the amount are those that are enacted or substantially enacted, at the reporting date for each  concerned jurisdiction. Current income tax relating to items recognised outside the statement of profit and loss is recognised  outside the statement of profit and loss (either in other comprehensive income (OCI) or in equity).  The Group periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in  which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where  appropriate. Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to  offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability  simultaneously. 	 	 ii)	 Deferred Tax Deferred tax is recognised using the Balance Sheet approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities  are recognised for deductible and taxable temporary differences arising between the tax base of  assets and liabilities and their carrying amount, except when the deferred tax arises from the initial  recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects  neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available  against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits  and unused tax losses can be utilised. The carrying amount of unrecognised deferred tax assets are  reviewed at each reporting date to assess their realisability and corresponding adjustment is made  to carrying values of deferred tax assets in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the  year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have  been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where a legally enforceable right exists to offset current  tax assets and liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same  taxation authority. Net outstanding balance in Deferred Tax account is recognized as deferred tax  liability/asset for each individual subsidiary in the Group. Deferred tax includes MAT tax credit. The Group recognises tax credits in the nature of MAT credit as  an asset only to the extent that there is convincing evidence that the Group will pay normal income  tax during the specified period, i.e., the period for which tax credit is allowed to be carried forward.  The Group reviews the such tax credit asset at each reporting date to assess its recoverability. 	 l)	 Inventories 	 	 i)	 Inventories are valued at lower of cost or net realisable value. 	 	 ii)	 Cost of inventories have been computed to include all costs of purchases, cost of conversion, all  non refundable duties & taxes and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present  location and condition. 	 	 iii)	 The basis of determining cost for various categories of inventories are as follows: 	 	 	 Raw Material	 	 : 	 Weighted Average Cost 	 	 	 Traded Goods	 	 : 	 Weighted Average Cost 	 	 	 Stores and Spares	 : 	 Weighted Average Cost Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended 31st March, 2022 Annual Report 2021-22 375 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 378 ===== iv)	 Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated  cost of completion and estimated cost necessary to make the sale. Necessary adjustment for  shortage / excess stock is given based on the available evidence and past experience of the Group. 	 m)	 Provision, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets Provisions are recognised for when the Group has at present, legal or contractual obligation as a result  of past events, only if it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic outgo or loss will  be required and if the amount involved can be measured reliably. If the effect of the time value of money  is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the  risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage  of time is recognised as a finance cost. Contingent liabilities being a possible obligation as a result of past events, the existence of which will be  confirmed only by the occurrence or non occurrence of one or more future events not wholly in control  of the Group are not recognised in the accounts. The nature of such liabilities and an estimate of its  financial effect are disclosed in notes to the financial statements. Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements. the nature of such assets and an  estimate of its financial effect are disclosed in notes to the financial statements. 	 n)	 Revenue recognition Revenue from contract with customer is recognised upon transfer of control of promised products  or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Group expects to  receive in exchange for those products or services. Revenue is measured based on the transaction  price, which is the consideration, adjusted for discounts and other incentives, if any, as per contracts  with the customers. Revenue also excludes taxes collected from customers in its capacity as agent. 	 	 The specific recognition criteria described below must also be met before revenue is recognised. 	 	 i)	 Sale of Goods Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the control of the goods has been passed to the  customer as per the terms of agreement and there is no continuing effective control or managerial  involvement with the goods. 	 	 ii)	 Rendering of Services 	 	 	 Revenue from services rendered is recognised when the work is performed and as per the terms of  agreement. 	 	 iii)	 Service Concession Arrangements Revenue related to construction services provided under service concession arrangement is  recognised based on the stage of completion of the work performed. Operation and maintenance  services revenue with respect to intangible assets is recognised in the period in which the services  are provided by the Group. Finance income is recognised using effective interest rate method for  financial assets. iv)	 Dividends Revenue is recognised when the Group’s right to receive the payment is established, which is  generally when shareholders approve the dividend. v)	 Interest Income Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the  effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash  receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount on  Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended 31st March, 2022 Adani Enterprises Limited 376 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 379 ===== initial recognition. vi)	 Profit or Loss on Sale of Investment Profit or Loss on Sale of Investment is recognised on the contract date. Contract Assets A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to  the customer. If the Group performs by transferring goods or services to a customer before the  customer pays consideration or before payment is due, a contract asset is recognised for the earned  consideration that is conditional. The same is disclosed as “Unbilled Revenue” under Other Current  Financial Assets. Trade Receivable A receivable represents the Group’s right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional i.e.  only the passage of time is required before payment of consideration is due. Contract Liability A contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Group  has received consideration (or an amount of consideration is due) from the customer. Contract  liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Group performs under the contract The same is  disclosed as “Advance from Customers” under Other Current Liabilities. 	 o)	 Employee Benefits Employee benefits includes gratuity, compensated absences, contribution to provident fund, employees’  state insurance and superannuation fund. 	 	 i)	 Short Term Employee Benefits Employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the services are classified  as short term employee benefits and recognised in the period in which the employee renders the  related service. These are recognised at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be  paid in exchange for that service. 	 	 ii)	 Post Employment Benefits 	 	 	 Defined Contribution Plans Retirement benefits in the form of provident fund and superannuation fund are defined contribution  schemes. The Group has no obligation, other than the contribution payable to these funds. The  Group recognises contribution payable to these funds as an expense, when an employee renders  the related service. 	 	 	 Defined Benefit Plans The Group operates a defined benefit gratuity plan. The cost of providing benefits under the defined  benefit plan is determined based on actuarial valuation, carried out by an independent actuary,  using the projected unit credit method. The liability for gratuity is funded annually to a gratuity  funds maintained with the Life Insurance Corporation of India and SBI Life Insurance Company  Limited. Re-measurements gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial  assumptions are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit  to retained earnings through other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Re- measurements are not reclassified to Statement of Profit and Loss in subsequent periods. Net  interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of defined benefit liability or  Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended 31st March, 2022 Annual Report 2021-22 377 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 380 ===== asset. The Group recognises the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation as an expense in  the Statement of Profit and Loss in the line item “Employee Benefits Expense”: - Service cost including current service cost, past service cost, gains and losses on curtailments and  non-routine settlements; and - Net interest expense or income 	 	 iii)	 Other Long Term Employee Benefits Other long term employee benefits comprise of compensated absences/leaves. The actuarial  valuation is done as per projected unit credit method. Remeasurements as a result of experience  adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the Statement of Profit and  Loss. iv)	 For the purpose of presentation of defined benefit plans and other long term benefits, the allocation  between current and non-current provisions has been made as determined by an actuary. 	 p)	 Borrowing Costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying  asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are  capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that  an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds. Transaction costs in respect of long-term  borrowings are amortised over the tenor of respective loans using effective interest method. All other  borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Borrowing costs also includes  exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded as an  adjustment to the borrowing costs. q)	 Leases The Group assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at the inception of the contract. A contract is,  or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period  of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use  of an identified asset, the Group assesses whether (i) the contract involves the use of identified asset;  (ii) the Group has substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset through the period  of lease and (iii) the Group has right to direct the use of the asset. The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The  right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability  adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs  incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the site on  which it is located, less any lease incentives received. Certain lease arrangements include the option to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the  lease term. The right-of-use assets and lease liabilities include these options when it is reasonably  certain that the option will be exercised. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the  commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of  the lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any,  and adjusted for certain re-measurements of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at  the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot  be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental  Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended 31st March, 2022 Adani Enterprises Limited 378 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 381 ===== borrowing rate as the discount rate. The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is  remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate,  if there is a change in the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value  guarantee, or if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or  termination option. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying  amount of the right-of-use asset or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use  asset has been reduced to zero. Lease payments have been classified as financing activities in Statement of Cash Flow. The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short term leases  that have a lease term of less than or equal to 12 months with no purchase option and assets with low  value leases. The Group recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense  in statement of profit and loss over the lease term. The related cash flows are classified as operating  activities. r)	 Business Combination Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. The cost of  an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets transferred, equity instruments issued and  liabilities assumed at their acquisition date i.e. the date on which control is acquired. Contingent  consideration to be transferred is recognised at fair value and included as part of cost of acquisition.  Transaction related costs are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred. For each business  combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair  value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Where the aggregate of consideration transferred and amount recognised for non-controlling interests  exceeds the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the excess is recorded  as goodwill. After initial recognition, goodwill is tested for impairment annually and measured at cost  less any accumulated impairment losses if any. Alternatively, in case of a bargain purchase wherein  the aggregate of consideration transferred and amount recognised for non-controlling interests is  lower than the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the difference is  recognised as capital reserve within equity. Business combinations involving entities under common control are accounted for using the pooling  of interest method, wherein the assets and liabilities of the business acquired are reflected at carrying  value. s)	 Segment Accounting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting to management. For  management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services. Operating results of the business units are monitored separately for the purpose of making decisions  about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on  profit or loss and is measured consistently with Statement of Profit and Loss in the financial statements. t)	 Earning Per Share (EPS) Basic EPS is computed by dividing the profit or loss attributable to the equity shareholders of the Group  by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is computed  Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended 31st March, 2022 Annual Report 2021-22 379 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 382 ===== by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to the ordinary equity shareholders and the weighted average  number of equity shares, for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. u)	 Service Work in Progress Service Work in Progress is valued at lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined based  on Weighted Average Cost Method. Service Work In Progress represents closing inventory of Washed and Reject Coal, which is not owned  by the Group as per the terms of Mine Development and Operation (MDO) contract. Hence, this  represents work performed under contractual liability in bringing this inventory to its present condition  and location. Net realisable value is the contract price as per the Mining Development and Operation (MDO) agreement  , less the estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale. v)	 Overburden Cost Adjustment Overburden removal expenses incurred during production stage are charged to revenue based on  waste-to-ore ratio, (commonly known as Stripping Ratio in the industry). This ratio is taken based on  the current operational phase of overall mining area. To the extent the current period ratio exceeds the  expected Stripping Ratio of a phase, excess overburden costs are deferred. w)	 Expenditure Expenses are net of taxes recoverable, where applicable.

The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise of borrowings, provisions, trade and other  payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group’s operations and projects. 	 Fair Value Hierarchy : 	 The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that  are either observable or unobservable and consists of the following three levels: 	 Level-1 : Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 	 Level-2 : Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level-1 that are observable for the asset or  liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). 	 Level-3 : Inputs are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in  whole or in part using a valuation model based on the assumptions that are neither supported by prices from  observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data. 	 The following tables summarises carrying amounts of financial instruments of continuing operations by  their categories and their levels in fair value hierarchy for each year end presented.

Annual Report 2021-22 409 CORPORATE OVERVIEW STATUTORY REPORTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 412 ===== Notes forming part of the Consolidated Financial Statements  for the year ended 31st March, 2022 40	FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK REVIEW (Contd.) 	 (i)	 Market Risk Market risk is the risk that future earnings and fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument  may fluctuate because of changes in market price. Market risk comprises of price risk, currency risk and  interest risk. 	 	 A. 	 Commodity Price Risk : The Group’s performance is affected by the price volatility of commodities being traded (primarily coal  and also other materials) which are being sourced mainly from international markets. As the Group is  engaged in the on-going purchase or continuous sale of traded goods, it keeps close monitoring over  its purchases to optimise the price. Commodity prices are affected by demand and supply scenario  in the international market, currency exchange fluctuations and taxes levied in various countries. To  mitigate price risk, the Group effectively manages availability of coal as well as price volatility through  widening its sourcing base, appropriate combination of long term and short term contracts with its  vendors and customers and well planned procurement and inventory strategy. 	 	 B. 	 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk : Since the Group operates internationally and portion of the business transacted are carried out in  more than one currency, it is exposed to currency risks through its transactions in foreign currency  or where assets or liabilities are denominated in currency other than functional currency. The Group evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from foreign currency transactions and follows  established risk management policies including the use of derivatives like foreign exchange forward  and option contracts to hedge exposure to foreign currency risks. For open positions on outstanding foreign currency contracts and details on unhedged foreign  currency exposure, Refer Note 41. Every percentage point depreciation / appreciation in the exchange rate between the Indian Rupee  and the U.S. Dollar, would have affected the Group’s profit before tax for the year as follows : (H in Crores) Particulars For the year ended  31st March, 2022 For the year ended  31st March, 2021 Impact on Consolidated profit before tax for the year 55.53 3.94 	 	 C. 	 Interest Risk : The Group is exposed to changes in interest rates due to its financing, investing and cash  management activities. The risks arising from interest rate movements arise from borrowings with  variable interest rates. The Group manages its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of  fixed and variable rate loans and borrowings. The Group’s risk management activities are subject to the Management, direction and control of  Central Treasury Team of the Adani Group under the framework of Risk Management Policy for  interest rate risk. The Group’s central treasury team ensures appropriate financial risk governance  framework through appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified,  measured and managed in accordance with the Group’s policies and risk objectives. For Group’s floating rate borrowings, the analysis is prepared assuming that the amount of the  liability outstanding at the end of the reporting period was outstanding for the whole year. A  50 basis point increase or decrease is used, which represents management’s assessment of the  reasonably possible change in interest rate.

Financial instruments that are subject to credit risk principally consist of  Loans, Trade and Other Receivables, Cash & Cash Equivalents, Investments and Other Financial Assets.  The carrying amounts of financial assets represent the maximum credit risk exposure. Credit risk encompasses both, the direct risk of default and the risk of deterioration of creditworthiness  as well as concentration of risks. Credit risk is controlled by analysing credit limits and creditworthiness  of counter parties on continuous basis with appropriate approval mechanism for sanction of credit  limits. Credit risk from balances with banks, financial institutions and investments is managed by the  Group’s treasury team in accordance with the Company’s risk management policy. Cash and cash  equivalents and Bank deposits are placed with banks having good reputation, good past track record  and high quality credit rating and also reviews their credit-worthiness on an on-going basis. Since the Group has a fairly diversified portfolio of receivables in terms of spread, no concentration risk  is foreseen. A significant portion of the Group’s receivables are due from public sector units (which are  government undertakings) and hence may not entail any credit risk.

The Group’s objective is to provide financial resources to meet its  obligations when they are due in a timely, cost effective and reliable manner and to manage its capital  structure. The Group monitors liquidity risk using cash flow forecasting models. These models consider  the maturity of its financial investments, committed funding and projected cash flows from operations.  A balance between continuity of funding and flexibility is maintained through continued support from  trade creditors, lenders and equity contributions.

(b)	 The liability for compensated absences as at the year ended 31st March, 2022 is H 94.81 Crores (31st March,  2021 H 53.05 Crores). (c)	 Contributions to Defined Benefit Plans are as under : 	 The Group’s Indian Subsidiaries has a defined benefit gratuity plan (funded) and is governed by the Payment  of Gratuity Act, 1972. Under the Act, every employee who has completed at least five year of service is  entitled to gratuity benefits on departure at 15 days basic salary (last drawn basic salary) for each completed  year of service. The scheme is funded with contributions to insurers in form of a qualifying insurance policy. 	 Aforesaid post-employment benefit plans typically expose the Group to actuarial risks such as: investment  risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk and salary risk Investment Risk: These Plans invest in long term debt instruments such as Government securities and highly  rated corporate bonds. The valuation of which is inversely proportionate to the interest  rate movements. There is risk of volatility in asset values due to market fluctuations and  impairment of assets due to credit losses. Interest Risk: The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated using a discount rate  which is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on  Government securities. A decrease in yields will increase the fund liabilities and vice-versa. Longevity Risk: The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated by reference to the best  estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An  increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability.	 Salary Risk: The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated by reference to the future  salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in salary of the plan participants will  increase the plan’s liability.

Sensitivity Analysis: The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the assumptions  occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant. The results of  sensitivity analysis is given below : (H In Crores) Change in Assumption Change in  Rate As at  31st March, 2022 As at 31st March, 2021 Increase in  Assumption Decrease in  Assumption Increase in  Assumption Decrease in  Assumption Discount Rate ( - / + 1 %) 7.90   30.12   14.93   25.13  Salary Growth Rate ( - / + 1 %)  29.86  8.01   24.99   14.95  Attrition Rate ( - / + 0.50 %)  16.36   21.45   18.70   20.80  Mortality Rate ( - / + 10 %)  18.42   18.45   19.61   19.65  The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined  benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as  some of the assumptions may be correlated. There is no change in method of valuation for the prior period. (5)	 Maturity Profile of Obligations The weighted average duration of the defined benefit plan obligation at the end of the reporting period is 3  Years to 18 Years (31st March 2021: 2 Years to 20 Years). The expected maturity analysis of gratuity benefits  is as follows : 	 (H In Crores) Particulars As at  31st March, 2022 As at  31st March, 2021 Within 1 year  15.90   10.21  2 to 5 years  54.03   15.28  6 to 10 years  44.75   18.70  More than 10 years  59.73   73.10  (6)	 Asset - Liability Matching Strategies The company and its subsidiaries have purchased insurance policy, which is basically a year-on-year cash  accumulation plan in which the interest rate is declared on yearly basis and is guaranteed for a period of one  year. The insurance Company, as part of the policy rules, makes payment of all gratuity outgoes happening  during the year (subject to sufficiency of funds under the policy). Any deficit in the policy assets are funded  by the such companies. The policy helps mitigate the liquidity risk. However, being a cash accumulation  plan, the duration of assets is shorter compared to the duration of liabilities. Thus, the companies are  exposed to movement in interest rate (in particular, the significant fall in interest rates, which should result  in a increase in liability without corresponding increase in the asset). (d)	 The estimate of future salary increase, considered in actuarial variation, take account of inflation, seniority,  promotion and other relevant factors, such as supply and demand in the employment market. (e)	 The expected contribution to the fund in the next financial year is in line with current financial year.
