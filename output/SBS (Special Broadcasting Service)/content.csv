This Annual Report was approved by the Board  on 29 August 2024 and has been produced  in accordance with the Public Governance,  Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (Cth) and  the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991 (Cth). As we enter SBS’s 50th year, the network is better  placed than ever to serve Australia’s growing and  evolving population. This is even more important  as social cohesion and trust in institutions today  face their greatest challenges in decades. Safeguarding social cohesion and the sustainability  of trusted information providers is given increased  salience amid proliferating dis- and misinformation  enabled by multinational tech platforms that put  revenue ahead of corporate responsibility. SBS was  proud to be named the most trusted news brand in  Australia by the University of Canberra and Reuters  Institute for the Study of Journalism’s annual  global Digital News Report 2024 – a reflection of  the commitment shown by our teams right across  the network. The report finds public concern about  false and misleading information increased from  64% in 2022 to 75%, with audiences reporting greater  difficulty in identifying untrustworthy information. Letter to   the Minister From the Chair and   Managing Director    The Hon Michelle Rowland MP Minister for Communications  Parliament House  Canberra ACT 2600 The report also found that for one in four  Australians, social media is their main source  of news, with a growing number of young  people exclusively relying on it. SBS is acutely aware of the risks posed by under- regulated technology firms both from a commercial  and societal perspective. The dominance of  global social media and technology providers  presents significant threats to the local media  landscape, signalling the need for clear and  robust global tech policies, such as the recent  legislation establishing a prominence framework  for connected devices, passed by Parliament  in July 2024. SBS will continue to advocate for  regulatory and policy settings that will ensure  the accessibility and viability of SBS services  for Australians on all screens and platforms. Throughout 2023-24, SBS continued to solidify  its role as a truly national broadcaster. The  year saw our most significant investment in  local television programming, with productions  in every state and territory. This reflects our  commitment to serve all Australians, to spotlight  important national debates, and to ensure  diverse voices across the country are heard. Some key highlights included NITV’s flagship  current affairs show, The Point, which embarked on  a nearly 40,000 kilometre journey to communities  Dear Minister, Chair, George Savvides AM and Managing Director, James Taylor 8 SBS ANNUAL REPORT  ===== PAGE 9 ===== George Savvides AM  Chair  James Taylor  Managing Director  across Australia ahead of the 2023 Voice to  Parliament Referendum; SBS’s three-part series,  The Hospital: In the Deep End, telling the human  stories of life inside one state’s strained public  health system; and Australia’s longest-running  current affairs program, Dateline, tracking  down and securing an exclusive interview with  Western Sydney schoolboy Yusuf Zahab in  Syria, where he had been taken by his family  in 2015 to live under the Islamic State. And, of  course, the second series of Alone Australia  reached more than four million viewers − one  of the biggest hits of 2024 on Australian TV  and Broadcaster Video on Demand (BVOD). Our audio and digital services in more than  60 languages continue to go from strength to  strength, with the introduction this year of five  new digital language services (Bislama, Malay,  Oromo, Telugu and Tetum) and SBS taking  out the Best Australian Podcast Publisher  of the Year for the second year in a row.   SBS’s distinctive and multiplatform news,  documentary, sport and entertainment offering  is the product of our deep engagement and  connection with our communities and audiences.  From urban centres to the more remote corners  of Australia, SBS is telling the stories that matter.   SBS’s Environmental, Social and Governance  (ESG) credentials were further strengthened with  innovative steps, including the transition to 100%  renewable energy (in 2022-23) and the recent  introduction of a feature that allows audience  members to opt-out of advertising related to  wagering, alcoholic beverages and quick service  restaurants on SBS On Demand. The opt-out  initiative aligns with our commitment to responsible  broadcasting, while enhancing the experience for  both viewers and commercial partners, with the  latter benefiting from a more receptive audience.  SBS On Demand this year achieved the highest  internal customer service rating in its history, with  a highly engaged audience also pushing the SBS  On Demand app to the top of both the Apple  iOS and Google Android app store ratings. SBS  is connected and accountable to our audiences  in a way few others in Australian media are.  Our digital innovation saw SBS named by the  Australian Financial Review as one of 2023’s most  innovative companies − the only media outlet to  make the list − in recognition of our work in recent  years. This includes our ability to publish machine- assisted translation of content in more than 60  languages to provide audiences the ability to  identify and filter according to their preferences,  and to understand individual users’ preferences to  enable the personalised recommendation of SBS  content in preferred languages. These features,  unique to SBS, highlight our ongoing commitment  to innovation and put the audience first in a  way not seen elsewhere in Australian media. The SBS staff engagement score is the highest  it has ever been, underscoring our people’s  dedication to the network’s purpose and high-  performance culture.  Regarding our operational future, we have engaged  constructively with the feasibility study into the  potential relocation of SBS’s headquarters and  will continue to work with the Government on  this process.  With strong community links, innovative digital  delivery, record levels of public trust, and a deep  commitment to our Charter, SBS will continue  to drive positive outcomes and contribute  meaningfully to Australia’s cultural and social  fabric. We look forward to continuing our work,  building on SBS’s role as an energised, vital and  vibrant part of Australia’s media landscape.  Finally, we extend our appreciation to the SBS  Board for its commitment to good governance  and thank our senior executives and staff  for delivering another excellent year for our  diverse audiences across the country.  9 SBS’S PURPOSE  ===== PAGE 10 ===== Our vibrant and diverse offering  SBS is Australia’s most distinctive and multilingual broadcaster,  occupying a unique place in the Australian media market.

NITV led SBS’s cross network coverage, and also  provided a vital platform for a diversity of First  Nations voices. Alongside SBS’s unique ability to  reach and engage all Australians in their preferred  language through SBS Audio, and as home to  Australia’s most trusted news brand in SBS News,  the network played a crucial role in ensuring  all Australians could be informed with trusted,  accurate and reliable news, context and insights,  different perspectives, and facts countering  misinformation and disinformation in the debate.  NITV’s flagship current affairs program, The Point,  transformed and the show hit the road in 2023,  travelling nearly 40,000 kilometres to every state  and territory to broadcast programs on Country to  hear directly from communities. It epitomised the  unique access and trust in NITV with referendum  coverage delivered in a way not seen elsewhere  in Australian media. Through in-depth storytelling  and on-the-ground reporting, the program enriched  public discourse but also reinforced NITV’s role as a  vital conduit for authentic and inclusive First Nations  representation in Australian media. The program’s  approach resonated with audiences, The Point  increased its audience by 58% in the 2023 calendar  year compared to 2022.10 SBS’s key point of difference was its ability  to deliver news, information and analysis to  multilingual audiences in their preferred languages,  across platforms. Journalists across all SBS News  and SBS Audio platforms collaborated closely with  NITV to ensure First Nations perspectives were  embedded in the coverage, and collaboration with  SBS’s language services ensured multicultural  perspectives were reflected. Along with the latest  news and key developments in the debate, SBS  supported multicultural communities to take part  in the process with video, article and podcast  explainers that covered everything from how to  enrol to vote, context and the history of Indigenous  affairs that led to this moment. All of this content  was available in more than 60 languages via the  SBS Voice Referendum Portal, an online destination  launched in early 2023.

With wall-to-wall coverage of the referendum dominating the  news, NITV enjoyed increased prominence and awareness among the general public. What  especially impressed many in the media was the broadcaster didn’t take sides in the debate -  meticulously interviewing Aboriginal Australians on all sides of the debate.” DAILY MAIL AUSTRALIA Original First Nations storytelling   In a year that saw Indigenous affairs at the top of the national agenda, NITV’s original content offering   provided all Australians with a deeper understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures,   histories and knowledges.

We tell stories no one else does,  in a way that no one else can. SBS continued its legacy of compelling  documentaries exploring the issues challenging  all Australians and bringing attention to  important national and global issues. The critical issue of health was explored through  Australia’s Sleep Revolution with Dr Michael  Mosley, the late medical journalist who himself  suffered from insomnia and trialled a world- first Australian sleep treatment program being  developed by the Flinders University Sleep  Institute. In March 2024, Dr Mike Freelander MP,  Chair of the Standing Committee on Health, Aged  Care and Sport, moved a motion that the House  of Representatives notes ‘recent SBS television  series Australia’s Sleep Revolution with Dr Michael  Mosley and its role in raising awareness of the  importance of sleep to health and wellbeing.’ The exploration of health continued in three- part series The Hospital: In the Deep End, which  sent Australian icons Costa Georgiadis, Melissa  Leong and Samuel Johnson to the frontlines of  St Vincent’s Hospital Sydney to provide raw and  unflinching insights into the public health system  and the everyday heroes who keep it running.

In 2023-24, SBS continued to deliver initiatives and work closely with partners  across the sector, with a particular focus on elevating talent and investing in opportunities that create  meaningful impact.  Information about the work SBS is doing is published and regularly updated on the SBS website, with  highlights of key activities outlined below. SBS Commissioning Equity & Inclusion Guidelines SBS continued to work closely with production partners to ensure all Australians are seeing themselves,  their communities and their stories reflected on screen, as we delivered the third year of the Commissioning  Equity & Inclusion Guidelines 2021-2024.  The Guidelines, which outline genre-specific targets for representation of people who identify as culturally  and linguistically diverse, First Nations, people with disability, LGBTQI+, and women, in on and off-screen  roles and for career progression, apply across drama, entertainment and food programming commissioned  and made internally by SBS.

This definition of CALD includes European, Asian, Middle Eastern, African and South and Central  American ancestry/ethnicity.  ‡ LGBQA+ is the terminology used in The Everyone Project, compared to SBS’s use of LGBTQI+. The Everyone Project defines LGBQA+ as contributors who, in  answering the survey, identified as lesbian, gay or homosexual, bisexual, queer, asexual or who identified with a sexual orientation other than straight/heterosexual.  The Everyone Project  To track progress against the Guidelines, SBS uses data collected through its participation in The  Everyone Project (TEP) − an industry-wide commitment to measure cast and crew diversity across  registered Australian film and television productions, and SBS Scripted Target Reports which are  filled by partner production companies.  In 2023-24, SBS measured and analysed the second year of cast and crew demographic data for  productions registered in TEP in the 12 months from 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023. We are currently  awaiting results for the third and final year of data from 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024 and  SBS has committed to publishing a final report on three-year target performance.  From 2022-23, SBS captured TEP data from 25 SBS programs (20 Unscripted and five Scripted) and six  NITV programs. The results show SBS is continuing to perform above the rest of the TV industry for  representation of people who identify as culturally and linguistically diverse, First Nations, people   with disability, and females, and is performing above the Australian population level for  LGBTQI+ representation.

Following the success of the three Digital Originals which premiered in 2022-23, three new projects  received further development funding and were chosen to move into production: Moni  A Pasifika project from Pelesasa  Pics, led by creator Taofia  Pelesasa, director Alana Hicks,  producer Nicole Coventry,  and executive producer Eliorah  Malifa. Moni, a 30-something  gay Samoan man, is haunted  by the re-emergence of a deep  secret he has harboured from   his childhood.  On return to his family and his  hometown of Western Sydney  he is confronted with the cultural  and community pressures he  had escaped from – making  his journey to healing a difficult  one. But guidance comes in  the unlikeliest way and from  the unlikeliest place – his dead  Samoan mother. Moonbird  Moonbird is a co-production  between Kutikina Productions,  the first-ever Tasmanian  Aboriginal screen production  company, and Sheoak Films,  created by director and writer  Nathan Maynard, writer and  producer Adam Thompson, and  producer Catherine Pettman. Set on a remote Tasmanian  island, a recently sober father  tries to reconnect with his  son through a traditional  muttonbirding season, only to  face cultural and personal crises  that threaten their relationship  and force them to confront their  family’s disturbing history. Warm Props  An upbeat and biting series with  creator and director Jub Clerc,  co-writer and director Kimberley  Benjamin, and producer Jodie  Bell for Ramu Productions.  Caught between set life and  home life, Charlie Flogim is thrust  back to her remote hometown of  Broome where she is forced to  deal with a chaotic film shoot and  face the one person she vowed  never to see again.  Will her narcissistic boss  convince her that her career is  more important than family? Or  will Charlie see what truly matters  and fight for what’s right? All this  before the Warm Props take off at  the turning of the tides. Applications for the fifth round of Digital Originals opened in July 2024.  This popular initiative continues to prove itself as a valuable talent pipeline, with creatives  from Digital Originals progressing key creative roles in flagship SBS drama series.

This digital-first approach has given audiences more  choice and flexibility in how and when they tune  into our language content across linear and digital  audio platforms, including SBS Radio 1, SBS Radio  2, SBS Radio 3, SBS Arabic24 and SBS South Asian.  This update follows the success of the SBS  Audio website and app, rebranded from SBS  Radio in March 2023, and further recognises  that audiences are increasingly choosing to  consume their content via digital platforms,  including third-party social channels.

With audiences increasingly spending time on social media platforms, teams have focused on offering short-form videos on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and other platforms to provide audiences with up-to-date news, information and entertainment. The SBS News Digital team evolved its output in 2023-24 to better service audiences choosing to consume news on third-party platforms. While maintaining strong consumption  of news on SBS’s owned platforms, video views on third-party platforms doubled year-on-year (July-May),23 with YouTube viewing particularly strong, as audiences engaged with trusted news brands at a time when misinformation and disinformation is increasing. SBS Audio is also accelerating production of video content on third-party social channels like Facebook, YouTube and Instagram. Average SBS Audio monthly video views are 5.8 million, up 75% year-on-year, with more than 8,000 social videos published across the year.24 In 2023-24 we launched dedicated YouTube channels for key SBS Audio channels, including SBS South Asian, SBS Chinese and SBS Arabic24, publishing more than 2,140 videos, shorts and podcasts to engage and grow our online language communities. social video views billion  1.59 Plays on Facebook Plays on Facebook 15 million  million  2.8 62 62 SBS ANNUAL REPORT  ===== PAGE 63 ===== Strong social media growth driving audience connection  As the social media landscape continues  to evolve, SBS is strongly positioned at the  forefront of social engagement. Recognising  the volatility and uncertainty in the marketplace,  SBS expanded its activities to platforms with  growing audiences, such as YouTube. This  ensures our content remains relevant and  accessible, in line with changing user behaviour. SBS streamlined its social media structure by  merging several accounts in 2023-24, creating  more robust and unified channels. This both  simplified our messaging and enhanced the  user experience. The integration of the SBS On  Demand social profiles into the central team  has turned the brand into our top-performing  profile, outpacing our competitors. Our commitment to measuring social  media effectiveness led to the successful  implementation of Adobe tags in organic posts.  Continuing into 2024-25, this will provide deeper  insights and more precise analytics, enabling  targeted and impactful content strategies. Our strategy to meet audiences where they are,  especially with video content, has resulted in a  remarkable 30% increase in video views year-over- year, totalling more than 1.5 billion views.25 SBS  profiles and accounts have added nearly two  million followers and shares have increased 1%   year-over-year, significantly extending our reach   beyond existing followers.26 SBS has adopted sophisticated tools for managing  data, performance insights, publishing and  audience trends directly to the hands of our content  creators, facilitating smarter, data-driven decisions. SBS has also evolved our approach to moderation,  making it more effective, data-led and proactive.  This is crucial for combating misinformation,  protecting users from harmful content, and  maintaining the integrity of our platforms. By  leveraging advanced analytics and new tools,  misleading or offensive content can be more  swiftly identified and addressed, ensuring  our audiences remain informed and safe. In the year ahead, SBS aims to build on these  advancements with a continued focus on innovation,  audience insight and content excellence. 25.

Total  experience was pleasant and positive unlike  most organisations these days. Many thanks.” “Prompt reply.  Proper, clear advice.   Friendly follow up for further information.   Proper written reply to me personally.   Classy, professional service.” Testimonials from our audience “Again I wish to congratulate SBS on the recent series  hosted by Julia Zemiro (Great Australian Walks). Her  hosting of this series has been marvellous. She showed  a down-to-earth appreciation of the area through which  she walked and with the people she interviewed.  She  was able to give us (the viewers) a mostly unbiased  appreciation of the issues her interviewees spoke about,  and engendered an atmosphere of trust and confidence  in them so that they could speak freely. This is a real  art and one that a lot of interviewers do not have.” Audience feedback for Great Australian Walks with Julia Zemiro “Inspiring and beautiful panel discussion at Garma  beneath the glorious pandanus shades. Thank you - all  the speakers were so moving, and clear and informative.  Wish more Australians could hear and listen to their  voices.  Rachel Perkins explains the Voice so well and  Wesley always offers a different interesting insight.” Audience feedback for The Point: Referendum Road Trip “Thanks so much for your amazing Cook Up program. I’m  watching another inspiring episode as I write this email. Your  passion and creativity with food is always reflected in what  and how your guests so generously share with us. No doubt  there are many lovers of food that aspire to be on your show.” Audience feedback for The Cook Up with Adam Liaw 64 64 SBS ANNUAL REPORT  ===== PAGE 65 ===== Deborah Andersson Head of Community Activation and Engagement and  Christine Militsis Community Engagement, Activations Manager at a community event. 65 AUDIENCE FIRST  ===== PAGE 66 ===== Understanding audiences’  needs and preferences Ensuring accessibility  Captioning  In 2023-24, SBS captioned a  total of 2,524 hours of regulated  program content, ensuring  accessibility for deaf or hard of  hearing audiences. Exceeding  regulatory obligations, SBS  took proactive steps to  enhance accessibility by  captioning an additional  982 hours of non-regulated  programming. This included  a special focus on children’s  and family programming on  NITV, as well as popular series  available on SBS On Demand.  As audiences consume more  of the network’s programming  on SBS On Demand, this is  an important initiative. In-house subtitling  A clear commitment to accessibility is also reflected in our in- house subtitling efforts. Over the year, SBS subtitled in English  697 hours of programming, enabling a broader audience to  engage with our content. Additionally, an extra 178 hours of  programming was reviewed by SBS’s Access Services unit (ASPP)  to ensure the subtitles met the high standards expected by SBS,  maintaining accuracy and quality across all subtitled content. Subtitling and   Multilingual Project  Our Subtitling and Multilingual  Project continues to be a  cornerstone of our accessibility  initiatives. Given the large  volume of content and the  tight turnaround times, SBS has  implemented AI translation with  human verification to manage  the substantial workload. In the  reporting period, SBS provided  2,052 total hours of subtitling,  covering Arabic, Simplified  Chinese, Traditional Chinese,  Korean and Vietnamese,  expanding our reach and  delivering more content to  diverse linguistic communities. Doing quality control in this authentic way ensures that  people don’t go down unnecessary rabbit holes, only to be  pulled a different way when the story clearly shows they  missed something they didn’t know simply because it wasn’t  described. Working with the team at SBS I am part of the  creative process and truly believe we contribute to creating  a product that can be enjoyed equally by blind and sighted  viewers alike. This is equity.” SESSIONAL ACADEMIC AT DEAKIN UNIVERSITY AND  BLIND AUDIO DESCRIPTION QUALITY ADVISOR FOR SBS,  FRANCOIS JACOBS 66 66 SBS ANNUAL REPORT  ===== PAGE 67 ===== Leading audience research   Australia is now more multicultural than ever,  with 51.5%28 of the population born overseas  or having a parent born overseas. Research  at SBS provides a deep understanding of the  evolving content, platform and language needs  and preferences of our diverse audiences. Reaching one in two multilingual audiences on  a weekly basis29 through in-language programs  like SBS Mandarin, SBS Arabic24, and SBS  WorldWatch, our research demonstrates that SBS  connects with communities through trustworthy  news and information and entertainment. SBS multilingual audience research takes a  considered, representative and inclusive approach.  In-language research continued, now totaling  more than 70 studies conducted across 17  different language communities since 2015.  Our research has demonstrated that SBS’s  support for key cultural celebrations (Lunar New  Year, Ramadan and Eid al-Fitr, Diwali/Deepavali  and NAIDOC Week) helps promote cultural  diversity and foster a sense of belonging among  multilingual communities, strengthening social  cohesion, with the latest study showing that  69% of multilingual audiences who celebrate  Lunar New Year agreed that SBS’s celebration  of the event helped strengthen social cohesion  in Australia. See pages 70-72 for more detail on  SBS’s involvement in these key cultural moments. Research also finds that SBS plays an essential  role in audiences’ sense of belonging, with  73% of Mandarin speakers that engaged with  SBS Mandarin agreeing the program helped  them feel at home in Australia. Among Arabic  speakers who engaged with SBS Arabic24,  70% agreed the program helped increase their  understanding of social issues in Australia.30 In our continuous efforts toward greater  understanding, we researched sentiment  around reconciliation and found that younger  Australians were more familiar with First Nations’  histories, cultures and peoples compared to  older Australians. Both younger Australians  and multilingual Australians place greater  importance on reconciliation than the general  population, reflecting the ongoing importance of  sharing First Nations stories to all Australians. Research also uncovered the tastes and  preferences about Australian drama and SBS.  It found that drama is especially important to  SBS audiences, with 95% wanting to see more  original Australian drama on SBS. In particular,  92% of audiences felt Safe Home − an SBS  series exploring issues of domestic abuse in  Australia − was ‘relevant to today’s Australia’.31 28.

SBS Scripted Research, 2023 Audio Description  SBS produced 1,480 hours of new audio  described content, reflecting our commitment  to making content accessible to blind and  low vision audiences. SBS is working toward  launching audio description services on SBS On  Demand by Q2 2024-25. All SBS-commissioned  programs are audio described in-house, allowing  greater control over the scripting and narration  process, especially for subtitled material and  our more bespoke, themed productions. SBS places high value on lived experience,  collaborating with contractors who are blind or  have low vision to write, narrate and review some  of SBS’s in-house audio description scripts. For  NITV-commissioned programming, SBS always  uses Indigenous voices, ensuring authentic  representation and cultural sensitivity. The SBS  Access Services team also engages with an  Aboriginal Elder to provide guidance on language,  pronunciation and cultural matters, ensuring  that our content is respectful and accurate.

There was a significant scaling of culturally significant engagement activities across Lunar New Year,  Diwali/Deepavali and NAIDOC Week, while the 2022-23 pilot project for Eid al-Fitr was expanded into a full  project including Ramadan. High-value partnerships with multi-year commitments further embedded SBS  with key communities and partners including Multicultural NSW, Victorian Multicultural Commission, and  the SBS-UNHCR Les Murray Award for Refugee Recognition. Lunar New Year – Year of the Wood Dragon Lunar New Year is one of Australia’s most  celebrated occasions, with more than two billion  people worldwide observing and sharing the  festivities.

SBS’s Elevate RAP outlines the network’s  commitment to leadership in reconciliation  by increasing the prominence of Aboriginal  and Torres Strait Islander stories and  perspectives across the network. SBS’s vision through its Elevate RAP is to contribute  to greater recognition that the knowledges and  stories of First Nations peoples are enriching to  everyone in a thriving, multicultural Australia.

Every day, Indigenous coverage and perspectives  are shared across the entire SBS network and   increasingly, in more than 60 languages through   the SBS Audio network, including on-air, across   digital and podcasts.  A key highlight of this work in 2023-24 was the  unparalleled multiplatform and multilingual news  and information – led by NITV and delivered across  the network − in the lead up to the Referendum on  an Indigenous Voice to Parliament. This included  the SBS Voice Referendum portal, a dedicated  online destination launched by the network to  connect audiences – in whichever language they  speak − with the latest news and insights from  across NITV, SBS News and the multilingual SBS  Audio network. Explainers breaking down important  information and countering misinformation were  also available in more than 60 languages.

SBS delivered three Indigenous themed and  informed network activations throughout the year,  with the Always Was Always Will Be season in the  lead up to and on January 26, National Reconciliation  Week, and NAIDOC Week. These activations  amplified NITV’s leadership in First Nations  storytelling and delivery of distinctive content, and  also brought together teams across the organisation  to deliver a comprehensive, multiplatform  programming line-up, extensive news coverage,  explainers, education resources through SBS Learn,  community and staff engagement opportunities. Among other highlights delivering on this  commitment was the launch of two First Nations  language podcasts from NITV Radio: Jukurrpa Stories  in Warlpiri language, and Ngiyang, exploring the  reclamation of Wiradyuri language (see page 28). Commitment Two: We recognise the  critically important role of NITV as it  supports and strengthens the oldest living  culture in the world through the most  distinctive content offering in Australia. NITV audiences grew in 2023-24 (see page 31),  and NITV’s distinctive First Nations storytelling  was featured across the SBS network, exceeding  RAP targets. NITV also became available for the  first time as an HD channel (see page 33), and as  a result is now provided to audiences via both  HD and SD channels on linear television, as well  as streamed live on SBS On Demand where SBS  also curates special content collections elevating  Indigenous perspectives around key moments  and network activations. This included the SBS  On Demand Referendum Portal in 2023, housing  a collection of First Nations content designed to  inspire and increase understanding (see page 32).  Commitment Three: We value our  people and prioritise their success,  development and wellbeing. SBS continues to exceed targets for First Nations  representation across executive, senior, middle and  non-management cohorts (see page 86), as well  as the engagement of First Nations staff in SBS’s  key leadership development programs. In 2023-24,   a range of measures were also implemented  to support SBS’s Indigenous employment  representation and recruitment goals, including  the launch of a specific First Nations recruitment  webpage, a tailored campaign promoting SBS  as an employer for Aboriginal and Torres Strait  Islander peoples, community engagement  activities, and ongoing participation in programs  like CareerTrackers providing opportunities  to engage and support emerging talent.  SBS also launched a bespoke program for  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff to engage  in culturally immersive and enriching experiences,  with all First Nations staff invited to take part in two  ‘MabuLiyan’ (good spirits) off-site days – the first  in October 2023 and another in February 2024.

SBS met its target for procurement with   Indigenous-owned business, and also  continued its partnership with Supply Nation,  which supports the organisation in further  identifying and engaging with suppliers.  Among partnerships and ongoing engagement  with First Nations media organisations,  NITV established an MOU with Torres Strait  Islander Media Association (TSIMA), with a  journalist based on Waiben (Thursday Island)  delivering regular stories from the Torres Strait  for a national audience on NITV News.  Commitment Five: We hold ourselves  accountable. We follow through on our  commitments and we review and respond  when changes need to be made. SBS relaunched its First Nations Staff Advisory  Group in 2024, with a new name and culturally- informed structure designed to address  concerns about cultural load and invisible  labour of Indigenous staff taking on these  roles in organisations. Called Ngarra, a Dharug  language expression meaning ‘to listen’ and  ‘together with you’, members meet monthly  and their contributions are formally recognised  to ensure they are supported and resourced  to spend time on this aspect of their role. The  group brings together Aboriginal and Torres  Strait Islander staff from diverse cultures,  experiences, and identities to represent and  amplify the voices and perspectives of Aboriginal  and Torres Strait Islander staff across SBS.

The reporting period saw SBS use its position to lead the  market discussions on a number of key industry issues such as  responsible advertising, sustainability and better TV measurement.  SBS is also a highly efficient and contemporary national broadcaster   that, through our hybrid business funding model, is uniquely   positioned to drive positive commercial outcomes in the Australian   media market. 2023-24   At a glance Strong commercial  revenues   Despite a difficult advertising  market SBS Media performed  well across TV and audio.

Beyond 3%  NRMA Insurance became the  first brand to commit 3% of media  spend with First Nations media. Efficient   Over the nine-year period  to 2023-24, SBS’s ongoing  efficiency program produced  more than $70 million of  realised savings in 2023-24. 97 GREAT BUSINESS  ===== PAGE 98 ===== SBS Media 	 	 	 	 	 	           The SBS Media team drives around one-third of  SBS revenue through advertising and strategic  sponsorships across SBS television, digital, audio,  brand partnerships, events, cultural training,  video production and translation services. 	 	 	 	 	 	           SBS advertising revenues   In 2023-24, SBS’s advertising and sponsorship  activities generated $126.4 million.  	 	 	 	 	 	           SBS Media continues to grow and diversify  revenue opportunities, including services in the  areas of strategy, research, video production,  translation and cultural competence training. SBS Media uses its position to drive the market to better outcomes   Throughout the reporting period, SBS used its unique position in the commercial landscape to drive  the commercial media toward positive societal outcomes.  The SBS Upfronts in October 2023 gave more than 1,000 clients and media a preview of the SBS 2024   content slate. The broadcaster used its theme of ‘demand different’ to announce market leading   initiatives including:  • Being the first Australian broadcaster to switch to 100% renewable energy and set an ambitious   net zero target of 2045. The move reflects the need from brands for advertising partners/suppliers   to have clear and defined sustainability plans.  • The launch of a world-first Audience First opt-out functionality on SBS On Demand which allows  users to exclude themselves from certain classes of advertising in the categories of alcohol,  wagering and quick-service restaurants (QSR).  • The next evolution of the Beyond 3% initiative with new partnership tiers for brands. NITV also saw   NRMA insurance become the first major brand to commit 3% of its media spend to First Nations Media   (see case study box below).  SBS was also named the Diversity and Inclusion Partner with the Independent Media Advertising Association  (IMAA) representing our ongoing commitment to supporting local Australian media agencies and businesses. In August 2023, NRMA Insurance and NITV announced  an innovative new partnership which marked the  largest advertising investment by a single commercial  brand in the First Nations broadcaster. The partnership forms part of NRMA Insurance’s  support of the Beyond 3% initiative with the brand  committing 3% of its broadcast media spend to  First Nations media for 2023-24.  This partnership represents a substantial investment  in NITV, supporting investment into creating First  Nations stories. NRMA INSURANCE BECOMES FIRST BRAND TO COMMIT  3% OF MEDIA SPEND TO FIRST NATIONS MEDIA  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples  represent 3.8% of the Australian population, but it  is estimated that less than 0.3% of advertising in  Australia invested in media is dedicated to reaching  these audiences.  The Beyond 3% initiative was launched by SBS and  NITV in early 2021 seeking to engage media agencies  and marketers to begin to address this gap by learning  more about the role and value of First Nations media  in Australia.  98 98 SBS ANNUAL REPORT  ===== PAGE 99 ===== “What we saw from SBS was a strong focus on responsible advertising,  strong diverse content slate and a digital first approach.” DEEPAK TAHILIANI  HEAD OF DIGITAL INVESTMENT, GROUPM ON THE SBS UPFRONTS “SBS has pointed out the obvious truth that actually works in favour  of brands rather than against them – spending money to reach people  who are never going to buy your services is a waste of money.”  SOFIA GERAGHTY  B&T ON THE SBS ON DEMAND OPT-OUT “It would be great to have the other [traditional TV] networks followed SBS’s lead  in taking a more collaborative approach to these [measurement] discussions.”  KRISTIAAN KROON  OMG CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER ON THE LAUNCH OF THE VIDEO FUTURE COLLECTIVE What the market said about SBS Media in 2023-24:  Ongoing efficiency savings Over the nine-year period to 2023-24, SBS’s ongoing efficiency program produced more than $70  million of realised savings in 2023-24. These efficiencies have been generated through vigilant annual planning processes, workflow  improvements, the renegotiation of supplier agreements, an evolved operating model utilising  best-in-class technology solutions, and investment in a working environment that fosters agile  practices and a highly engaged workforce. SBS has reinvested these efficiencies in the growth of digital services and distinctive cross-platform  content in line with its Charter to educate, entertain and inform all Australians. From 2015-16 to 2023-24,  SBS increased digital video and audio consumption hours by 674%, improved metro share by 28% (from  6.8% to 8.7%) in a declining free-to-air broadcast market, and increased commissioned hours by 151%. 800 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 FY16 FY17 FY18 FY19 FY20 FY21 FY22 FY23 FY24 Comparison of SBS Digital Video and Audio consumption hours, FTA TV share, First Run  commissioned TV hours, efficiencies reinvested and government funding (FY16-24) Indexed (FY16 = 100) SBS Network  FTA Metro share SBS Digital Video and  Audio consumption hours Reinvested  efficiencies Government  funding Commision hours  (first run) 674% growth in digital video   and audio consumption hours 253% growth in efficiencies  found, culminating in c.$70m of  realised savings in FY24 151% growth in Australian first  run commissioned TV hours 28% growth in TV share 17% growth in  government funding NOTE: Digital video and audio consumption hours include methodology changes across the period as analytics and coverage improved such as video co-viewing from January 2020 onwards.

Through partnerships and  collaboration with key suppliers, SBS has been  able to secure more accurate data to build a  more comprehensive picture of overall emissions  including Scope 3 (supplier emissions).  The Greenhouse Gas Assessment Report  found that emissions for SBS in 2022-23 across  Scope 1, 2, and 3 were 58,622 tCO2-e, which is  a 12.5% increase on the previous year, mainly  due to additional content. This equates to 43.8  tCO2-e per FTE and 1.22 tCO2-e per hour of  first run broadcast content – a new emissions  Measuring the carbon footprint  of the television shows we make  SBS also led the way in the  television industry with The Cook  Up with Adam Liaw becoming  the first television program to  measure its carbon footprint  through Sustainable Screens  Australia using the Albert  Calculator – a tool to calculate  and validate Greenhouse Gas  Emissions from productions. This  was followed swiftly by Insight  and Going Places with Ernie Dingo. SBS takes concrete   steps to decarbonise  SBS continues to take steps to  reduce emissions within its direct  control. During 2023-24, SBS  migrated part of its fleet to hybrid  or electric vehicles, shifted some  data centres to more energy  efficient cloud based solutions,  and updated its procurement  policies to build in sustainability.  2045 net zero target  aligns with latest science  SBS made a bold public  commitment to decarbonise  its operations and supply chain  to net zero emissions by 2045  across Scopes 1, 2 and 3. This  was based on extensive analysis  of the organisation’s supply chain  and credible pathways to reduce  emissions across all categories.  To ensure this modelling is  independently verified and  aligned with the latest science,  SBS has also applied for  validation of its net zero target by  global standards body Science  Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). 100% renewable energy  for the long term  Following the switch to 100%  renewable energy in 2022-23  through the purchase of Large  Scale Generation Certificates  (LGCs), SBS has now made a  longer-term commitment to  renewable energy through  the procurement of a 10-year  Power Purchase Agreement  which starts in July 2024.  This provides investment  to stimulate the renewable  energy market in Australia. Partnering with our suppliers  to help them decarbonise  During this year, SBS has  partnered with key suppliers  across content, technology and  marketing, engaging with them  on their sustainability strategies  to understand their progress  in measuring and reducing  their carbon footprints as this  contributes to SBS’s Scope 3  emissions. This has provided  an opportunity to improve  the data quality of emissions  calculations, as well as to  share lessons and insights with  suppliers to help accelerate  their decarbonisation plans. intensity metric that SBS has developed.  The Greenhouse Gas Assessment used the  Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodology to  measure SBS’s emissions across Scope 1, 2 and 3. • Scope 1 emissions are those which a company  has direct control over via ownership of activities.  • Scope 2 is purchased electricity, heat or steam.  • Scope 3 is indirect emissions from activities  or services purchased from other third-party  companies, which include indirect emissions  associated with Scope 1 and 2 sources. During this financial year, SBS took a strong  leadership position within the media and  corporate industry on sustainability. SUSTAINABILITY AT SBS 100 100 SBS ANNUAL REPORT  ===== PAGE 101 ===== SBS Green   SBS Green is an employee group established in 2018 with representation across the organisation. It aims   to drive employee engagement on sustainability issues and encourages sustainability education initiatives   and events to engage staff such as clothes swaps, encouraging sustainable habits, and celebrations of   key events such as Earth Day. Water and waste management   SBS recognises that its normal business operations have an impact on the environment and is seeking to  mitigate any adverse environmental impacts through several sustainability initiatives including recycling,  improvements to energy efficiency, water conservation measures, and the purchase of products made  from recycled materials. In 2023-24, the Pangolin Associates Report found that 51 kilograms of waste (a decrease of 73 kilograms)  and 10,967 litres of water (an increase of 5,785 litres) were used per SBS FTE employee (based on 1,337.3  FTE employees). SBS continues to look for ways to minimise and mitigate waste and water use. In 2023-24 the general  office recycling program recycled 100% of cardboard, paper and comingled waste, equalling a total of  58 tonnes of cardboard and paper and 78 tonnes of comingled waste. A further 161 tonnes, or 72%, of  general waste generated by SBS was recovered and diverted from landfill or reused. In addition,   1.28 tonnes of e-waste, and 7.8 m3 of polystyrene were recycled. Dedicated programs also continued to  encourage staff to recycle toner cartridges, mobile phones and phone batteries, redundant electrical  and data cabling, fluorescent lighting tubes and waste generated through building refurbishment work.

Cybersecurity  In light of escalating threats to  information security, SBS remains  steadfast in its commitment  to fortifying its cybersecurity  protocols and procedures. The  past year witnessed significant  strides in modernising our  infrastructure, coupled with  enhancements in assessing  third-party cyber risks. Moreover,  concerted efforts were dedicated  to fostering staff awareness  through comprehensive  exercises and effective  communication strategies. The growth of AI has been a seismic shift in the media landscape in recent years. As a public   broadcaster, SBS is committed to using this technology with the strongest safeguards and   ethical frameworks possible.  SBS has developed a simple principle-based framework for the responsible use of AI:  • Security first – AI follows the same rules as our employees. • AI is an intern – Humans are responsible for AI.  • AI works for us – We decide when and how to use AI.  To further the development of AI within the business, SBS has built an incubator team which   is working across both video and audio products to look at applications the safe for the  technology to create processes and efficiencies to help storytellers spend more time   creating content.

These initiatives are  integral parts of the BAI Communications network capital reinvestment program initiated in 2022-23. These programs will contribute significantly to further enhancing service reliability and reducing our   overall carbon footprint. By fostering a culture of resilience and sustainability, we have laid the groundwork   for further improvements in network reliability. The upgrade of Program Input Equipment (PIE) and the successful completion of various network   improvement projects have notably enhanced the reliability of our analogue radio network. These   advancements underscore our commitment to delivering high-quality service while minimising   environmental impact. Service performance monitoring   The utilisation of advanced analytics to  tackle systemic issues within our network  infrastructure has brought significant positive  outcomes for the performance of our broadcast  networks. The implementation of data-driven  maintenance strategies has resulted in a  consistent decrease in service-impacting faults,  thereby surpassing key performance indicators  (KPIs) for contracted availability targets on a  regular basis throughout 2023-24. This success has empowered SBS to substantially  diminish services downtime while enhancing  our responsiveness to any unforeseen  transmission faults.  Fault management system   SBS operates a complex fault management system  for all key suppliers. Each supplier is required to  log, manage and report on matters that impact  SBS transmission, including planned outages for  maintenance or project work, and compliance with  contractual technical performance specifications.  The SBS Managed Services team retains  detailed records of transmission issues  and faults to assess performance and efficacy  of service contractor management. SBS’s  real-time management of service outages is also  used to provide support directly to the audience  via the Audience Technical Support group  operating within the Zendesk ticketing system.

In 1991, the Special  Broadcasting Service Act (SBS Act) came into  effect and SBS became a Corporation. Responsible Minister    The Minister responsible is the Hon Michelle  Rowland MP, Minister for Communications,  who was appointed on 1 June 2022. Statement of governance    SBS business practices are governed by clear  delegations of authority, project (program)  management, policies for statutory compliance,  codes of conduct, review processes, budget  information linked to all planning processes,  policies and processes to ensure compliance  with competitive neutrality and a range of  other obligations, and regular monitoring and  reporting to the SBS Board and its Committees.  Good corporate governance at SBS is also based  on an acceptance by all staff that the highest  standards of integrity and ethical behaviour  are expected of them, as well as transparency  and consistency, in all their actions. The SBS  Code of Conduct provides a practical set of  guiding principles to help SBS team members  make decisions in their day-to-day work,  whatever they do and wherever they do it. Ministerial directions and notifications    SBS has not been notified by way of a  Government policy order under the PGPA  Act of any general policies of the Australian  Government that apply to SBS. No ministerial  directions have been issued under the SBS Act.

SBS Governance 111 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  ===== PAGE 112 ===== The SBS Ombudsman independently investigates audience complaints about SBS content to  ensure compliance with the SBS Code of Practice, which sets out the editorial standards for SBS. Centred around the principles of trust, transparency and respect, the SBS Code applies to all  programs on SBS television and radio, as well as content published by SBS on digital and social  media platforms, podcast services and streaming on SBS On Demand. Applying the Code to  all SBS content and platforms reflects the many ways audiences engage with SBS and their  expectations for consistent editorial standards across everything they watch, listen or read.   The 2023-24 financial year saw a national referendum and war in the Middle East, which  drove an increase in complaints received by the SBS Ombudsman’s office. Consistent with  this context, complaints alleging breaches of the Code provisions relating to Balanced  and impartial news and current affairs doubled during this period, overtaking Accuracy as  complainants’ number one concern (a position Accuracy has held for the past two years).  The SBS Ombudsman provides six-monthly reports to the SBS Board about trends in  audience complaints, breach findings, remedial actions and any audience appeals or  investigations by the ACMA. The SBS Ombudsman also meets with the Board’s Codes Review  Committee to provide analysis of issues raised by complainants and the outcomes.  Complaints investigated by the SBS Ombudsman may be considered by an internal  Complaints Committee established under the Code. Complaints that would benefit from  this group discussion may be referred to the Complaints Committee by the Ombudsman  or an SBS Director. No Complaints Committees were convened in 2023-24. Code complaints in 2023-24     In 2023-24, the SBS Ombudsman received 492 complaints. Only one was submitted via a letter in the  post, with the rest submitted electronically via a webform. Fifty-one of those complaints were informally  resolved by the Ombudsman’s office; 221 were assessed as not raising issues under the SBS Code of  Practice and referred to other SBS divisions for feedback or response. The SBS Ombudsman assessed  220 complaints as valid Code complaints this financial year, a 35% increase on the previous year.43   Most Code complaints concerned television content broadcast on SBS’s main channel (141), while  49 concerned SBS digital content, including social media posts, podcasts and content streamed  on SBS On Demand. There were six complaints about content broadcast on SBS VICELAND,  one concerning SBS Food content, 12 about content broadcast on NITV, and eight about films  broadcast on SBS World Movies. There were three complaints about content broadcast on radio.  Seven complaints related to content in languages other than English. Australian Communications and Media Authority       Complainants who are dissatisfied with the outcome of the SBS Ombudsman’s investigation about  television or radio content may refer their complaint to the Australian Communications and Media  Authority (ACMA) for external review.

This includes  the consideration of risk in achieving  SBS’s strategic objectives. The SBS Risk  Management Plan is reviewed annually and  was approved by the Board in August 2023. Risk management at SBS aims to:   • Provide assurance that SBS has identified  its highest-risk exposures (top risks) and has  taken steps to properly manage these. • Ensure that SBS’s business planning  processes include a focus on areas  where risk management is needed. • Ensure the integration of the various  and many risk control measures  that SBS already has in place. • Be comprehensive, practical and effective. The SBS Audit and Risk Committee, a sub- committee of the SBS Board, receives regular  reports on the management of identified ‘top  risks’ facing SBS, with identification of risks  allowing for the redirection or refocusing  of resources to address key issues.  SBS disaster recovery plan, Business Continuity  Plan and incident management    SBS continues to maintain a disaster recovery site  which has significantly enhanced its television  broadcast resilience capabilities, providing  redundancy to facilities in Melbourne and  Canberra and enabling continued operations in  the event of any issues. Through a renewal of the  SBS Playout agreement with Telstra Broadcast  Services, there are two separate data centre  locations that enable playout of SBS services,  further enhancing the resilience for audiences. SBS maintains a Business Continuity Plan to ensure  business recovery in the event of a full or partial  loss to the SBS premises, or IT systems in the event  of a cyber incident. In line with a commitment to  continuous improvement, Business Continuity  Plans are reviewed, tested and updated annually. SBS’s Emergency Control Organisation provides  head wardens and area wardens for each office,  comprised of management, security and staff.  Annual training ensures consistent management  of onsite incidents and evacuation protocols. Privacy    SBS takes a proactive approach to maintaining  high standards of privacy and trust concerning  the personal information of its audience and  staff. SBS’s Privacy strategy aligns with our  obligations under the Australian Privacy Act,  the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) and the  Australian Government Agencies Privacy Code.  SBS actively promotes a strong privacy culture  across its business. Over the annual reporting  period, the Privacy Team has conducted  communications and updates to staff about privacy  issues. SBS is an official supporter of Privacy  Awareness Week, and the Privacy Team launched  a range of initiatives to engage all staff in this  year’s themes: transparency, accountability and  security. New projects that could have a privacy  impact are reviewed under our Privacy Impact  Assessment (PIA) process. SBS also has robust data  breach protocols which are regularly assessed.

The Bill establishes a legislative framework that will guarantee the prominence of free-to-air media   providers’ services on connected televisions (CTVs) and devices.  As online audiences rapidly grow, it is increasingly important that SBS services are present and easily   accessible on the growing array of CTVs and devices through which audiences consume content.   The proposed framework will make free-to-air networks’ applications (apps) present and prominent,   ensuring Australian audiences can continue to easily access high-quality, locally-produced content   in the public interest − for free.  In 2023–24, SBS continued to work constructively with the Government and industry peers on this  important matter. Multicultural Framework Review  In late 2023, the Department of Home  Affairs conducted a review of institutional,  legislative and policy settings underpinning  Australia’s multiculturalism − the Multicultural  Framework Review. As a national cultural  institution underpinning and committing  to multicultural Australia, SBS participated  in the review and put forward five  recommendations through its submission: 1) A formalised and expanded role for  SBS will further deliver outcomes  for multicultural Australia. 2) An explicitly recognised cross- government framework for inter-agency  collaboration, rather than relying on ad- hoc collaboration opportunities. 3) The establishment of the Department of  Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs,  with the responsible Minister a part of Cabinet. 4) A new Multicultural Act, which should  include formal recognition of SBS’s role  as an ongoing member of an advisory  committee of a national body (or Commission)  for Australia’s multicultural matters. 5) Recognition of the value in further  investment in SBS, which could be from  agencies across all governments. National Broadcasters’ Independence  In the first half of the financial year, the Department  of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development,  Communications and the Arts consulted on  the Government’s review of options to support  the independence of national broadcasters — SBS and ABC. Stability and independence are  critical foundations to the vital role SBS plays.  SBS reiterated that the stability provided by the  Government’s introduction of the quinquennium  (five-year cycle) funding was welcomed as  it provided stability over the longer term.  SBS also proposed a range of changes to enhance  the Board appointment process, and measures to  support stable funding and ensure the ability to  seek additional funding during a quinquennium,  given the rapid pace of change in the media sector  and among SBS’s diverse Australian audiences. Government, regulatory and industry matters 120 120 SBS ANNUAL REPORT  ===== PAGE 121 ===== Feasibility study on a potential relocation of the  SBS headquarters to Western Sydney  SBS continued to engage constructively with the  Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional  Development, Communications and the Arts in  relation to the Feasibility Study into the relocation  of the Sydney-based headquarters and studios  of SBS from Artarmon to Western Sydney.  In May 2024 the Minister provided the initial  report of the Steering Committee to the  SBS Board for feedback, with a response  provided by the Board in July 2024.   The study’s outcomes will continue to be carefully  considered, noting that the Minister has indicated  any decision concerning relocation is ultimately a  matter for the SBS Board. SBS’s priority, as always,  is ensuring we are well-equipped with the people,  talent, tools and technology we need to meet our  Charter and continue delivering services to the  highest standard to audiences across Australia. Other key activities  In February 2024, the Parliamentary Friends of SBS  (a friendship group of federal parliamentarians)  and SBS hosted a Lunar New Year celebration at  the Mural Hall of the Parliament House, Canberra.  Attendees included the group’s Co-Chairs − Ms  Maria Vamvakinou MP (Member for Calwell), Ms  Dai Le MP (Member for Fowler), and Mr Russell  Broadbent MP (Member for Monash) − joined  by the Hon Michelle Rowland MP (Minister  for Communications), the Hon Andrew Giles  MP (Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and  Multicultural Affairs), and the Hon Tim Watts MP  (Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs), among  other federal parliamentarians and staff. The Co- Chairs, ministers, SBS Chair and Managing Director  performed a prosperity toss for good fortune,  hosted by Adam Liaw − the event’s host and star  of SBS’s The Cook Up with Adam Liaw series. Other matters  In the financial year, SBS continued to participate  in a wide range of public policy and regulatory  matters. These include in relation to anti- siphoning legislation (through the Bill that  addresses Prominence, outlined opposite),  Prohibited Hate Symbols and Other Measures  Bill 2023, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Combatting  Misinformation and Disinformation Bill 2023,  Australian Census 2026, Fair Pay for Radio Play  Bill 2023, COVID-19 Royal Commission’s terms  of reference, Basic Online Safety Expectations  Amendment Determination 2023, Scams  – Mandatory Industry Codes consultation,  News Media Assistance Program (News MAP),  General Search Services (through the Australian  Competition and Consumer Commission’s Digital  Platform Services Inquiry), close captioning, and  the statutory review of the Online Safety Act 2021. SBS expects to continue to participate in the   ongoing process of Privacy Reform, likely in   late 2024. SBS also continued to engage with the news,  media and screen production sectors, as  well as a wide range of stakeholders and  delegates, including through Australian and  international memberships and forums. 121 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  ===== PAGE 122 ===== Annual Performance  Statement 2023-24 I, Mr George Savvides AM, as a member of the accountable authority of the Special Broadcasting Service  (SBS), present the 2023-24 annual performance statements of the Special Broadcasting Service, as required  under paragraph 39(1)(a) of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (PGPA Act). In my opinion, these annual performance statements are based on properly maintained records,  accurately reflect the performance of the entity, and comply with subsection 39(2) of the PGPA Act. Our Purpose As described in our Charter, the principal function of the SBS is to provide multilingual and  multicultural radio, television and digital media services that inform, educate and entertain  all Australians, and, in doing so, reflect Australia’s multicultural society. In the SBS 2023-24 Corporate Plan, SBS has interpreted this function into a purpose that has  a positive impact on Australia’s diverse society:  SBS inspires all Australians to explore, respect and celebrate our diverse world, and in doing so,  contributes to a cohesive society. This purpose is mapped to the Portfolio Budget Statements (PBS) as follows: Purpose Delivered by Outcome Linked PBS programs  and sub-programs SBS inspires all Australians to  explore, respect and celebrate  our diverse world and in doing  so, contributes to a cohesive  society.

The APS  has been compiled and reviewed for accuracy  by SBS’s Finance team with input from other  teams including Television and Online Content,  Audio and Language Content, Corporate Affairs,  Audience Data and Insights, and Technology.  The data is retrieved from several different internal  and external data sources, which include: • IBMS and Oracle (internal)  • OzTAM and RegTAM TV ratings databases,  Streamguys and BAI Communications (external).  These source systems are essential  business information systems routinely  used by SBS management for resource  planning and management reporting  and are maintained accordingly.  SBS performed strongly across key initiatives  in 2023-24. Significant changes had an impact  on both SBS and Australia’s highly competitive  market for audiences. These included: • In the last year, net overseas migration drove  84% of Australia’s annual population growth, and  16% came from natural increase.46 More than  half of Australians are born overseas47 or have  a parent born overseas.48 As Australia becomes  increasingly multicultural and multilingual, it is  more important than ever for SBS to continuously  evolve to meet the needs of our diverse nation.  • More people are identifying as Aboriginal or  Torres Strait Islander (3.8% of the population),  a group growing at a faster rate than the  total Australian population.49 SBS remains  in a strong position to enable greater  engagement with First Nations affairs. • The Australian media landscape is undergoing a  period of rapid evolution as audiences gradually  shift away from broadcast media toward digital  platforms. This transfer is occurring across all  age groups in Australia to varying degrees.50 SBS  continues to serve all Australians by keeping pace  with the competitive video market to serve both  older and younger audiences on the broadcast  and digital platforms where they consume content.  • The economic outlook remains subdued  until at least 2026, creating headwinds for all  Australian businesses. SBS will continue to  navigate the challenging economic conditions  to maintain efficiency and prioritise investments  as conditions are forecast to ease. • Technological developments continue to  influence SBS operations. The landscape is  changing as connected TV providers become  intermediaries between broadcasters and  audiences. Secure data has become essential  to meet audience expectations around  personalisation. In addition, AI technologies have  shown potential for significant industry disruption,  further highlighting the need for regulation  and safeguards around privacy and data.51  • Regulatory forces remain pronounced,  especially around media reform and privacy.  Despite these challenges, SBS was successful  in delivering more content, increasing  consumption and growing commercial  revenue to reinvest in content.  The tables overpage summarise SBS’s results  against our Purpose, using the criteria identified in  the PBS and the SBS 2023-24 Corporate Plan. These  results are broken down by significant activity areas,  all of which contribute to SBS achieving its purpose. 46.	Australian Bureau of Statistics, National, State and Territory Population (reference period December 2023), published June 2024. https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/ people/population/national-state-and-territory-population/dec-2023  47.	Australian Bureau of Statistics, Australia’s Population by Country Of Birth (reference period June 2023), published April 2024. https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/ population/australias-population-country-birth/jun-2023 48.	Australian Bureau of Statistics media release, ‘2021 Census: Nearly half of Australians have a parent born overseas’, June 2022.  https://www.abs.gov.au/media-centre/ media-releases/2021-census-nearly-half-australians-have-parent-born-overseas  49.	Australian Bureau of Statistics, Estimates of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians (reference period June 2021), published August 2023. https://www.abs.gov. au/statistics/people/aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-peoples/estimates-aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-australians/30-june-2021  50.	Deloitte Australia, Media & Entertainment Consumer Insights 2023 (12th Edition). https://www.deloitte.com/au/en/Industries/tmt/perspectives/media-consumer- survey.html  51.	McKinsey, What’s the future of generative AI?

The financial statements of the Entity, which I have audited, comprise the following as at 30 June 2024  and for the year then ended:  	 y Statement by the Directors and Chief Financial Officer;   	 y Statement of Comprehensive Income;  	 y Statement of Financial Position;  	 y Statement of Changes in Equity;  	 y Cash Flow Statement;  	 y Notes to the financial statements, comprising material accounting policy information and other  explanatory information. Basis for opinion  I conducted my audit in accordance with the Australian National Audit Office Auditing Standards, which  incorporate the Australian Auditing Standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further  described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of my report.  I am independent of the Entity in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements for financial statement  audits conducted by the Auditor-General and their delegates. These include the relevant independence  requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board’s APES 110 Code of Ethics for  Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) to the extent that they are not  in conflict with the Auditor-General Act 1997. I have also fulfilled my other responsibilities in accordance  with the Code. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide  a basis for my opinion. Accountable Authority’s responsibility for the financial statements As the Accountable Authority of the Entity, the Special Broadcasting Service Corporation Board is  responsible under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (the Act) for the  preparation and fair presentation of annual financial statements that comply with Australian Accounting  Standards – Simplified Disclosures and the rules made under the Act. The Board is also responsible  for such internal control as the Board determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial  statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  In preparing the financial statements, the Board is responsible for assessing the ability of the Entity to  continue as a going concern, taking into account whether the Entity’s operations will cease as a result  of an administrative restructure or for any other reason. The Board is also responsible for disclosing, as  applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless the  assessment indicates that it is not appropriate. GPO Box 707, Canberra ACT 2601 38 Sydney Avenue, Forrest ACT 2603 Phone (02) 6203 7300   129 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 130 ===== Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements   My objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free  from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes  my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit  conducted in accordance with the Australian National Audit Office Auditing Standards will always detect  a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered  material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic  decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with the Australian National Audit Office Auditing Standards, I exercise  professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also:  	 y identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to  fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit  evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting  a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may  involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;  	 y obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures  that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the  effectiveness of the Entity’s internal control; 	 y evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting  estimates and related disclosures made by the Accountable Authority;  	 y conclude on the appropriateness of the Accountable Authority’s use of the going concern basis of  accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related  to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Entity’s ability to continue as a going  concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s  report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to  modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my  auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Entity to cease to continue as  a going concern; and  	 y evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the  disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events  in a manner that achieves fair presentation.  I communicate with the Accountable Authority regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and  timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control  that I identify during my audit.

The  objectives of the Corporation are set out in the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991.  The principal function of the Corporation is to provide multilingual and multicultural broadcasting and  digital media services that inform, educate and entertain all Australians and, in doing so, reflect Australia’s  multicultural society. a)	 The basis of preparation The financial statements are required by section 42 of the Public Governance, Performance and  Accountability Act 2013. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with: i)	 Public Governance, Performance and Accountability (Financial Reporting) Rule 2015 (FRR); and ii)	 Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations – including Simplified Disclosures for Tier 2  Entities under AASB 1060 issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) that apply  for the reporting period. The financial statements have been prepared on an accrual basis and in accordance with the historical  cost convention, except for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. Except where stated, no allowance  is made for the effect of changing prices on the results or the financial position. The financial statements  are presented in Australian dollars, which is the Corporation’s functional currency and values are  rounded to the nearest thousand dollars unless otherwise specified. The Corporation, for the purposes  of preparing the financial statements, is a not-for-profit entity. b)	 New and amended Accounting Standards  All new, revised or amending Standards and Interpretations that were issued prior to the sign-off date  and are applicable to the current reporting period did not have a material effect on the Corporation’s  financial statements. c)	 Significant accounting judgements and estimates In the process of applying the accounting policies, the Corporation has made the following judgements  that have the most significant impact on the amounts recorded in the financial statements:  i)	 Valuation of land and buildings as detailed in Note 2.2A  ii)	 Program amortisation as detailed in Note 2.2C.  iii)	 Long service leave as detailed in Note 3.1.  No accounting assumptions or estimates have been identified that have a significant risk of causing a  material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next reporting year. d)	 Taxation  The Corporation is exempt from all forms of taxation except Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) and the Goods and  Services Tax (GST). e)	 Foreign exchange Transactions denominated in a foreign currency are converted at the effective exchange rate on the date  of the transaction. The Corporation enters into foreign currency hedging arrangements to protect its purchasing power in  relation to foreign currency exposures. Expenditures denominated in foreign currencies are converted to  Australian dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction or at the hedged rate. All the gains and losses are taken to profit or loss with the exception of forward exchange contracts that  are classified as cash flow hedges used to hedge highly probable transactions. Gains and losses on cash  flow hedges held at balance sheet date are taken to equity.  f)	 Events after the reporting period There were no subsequent events that had the potential to significantly affect the ongoing structure and  financial activities of the Corporation. g)	 Changes to comparatives Where appropriate, comparatives have been reclassified from the prior year to align to the current  period presentation.

Where  an enforceable contract exists, revenue recognition is based on the delivery of performance obligations  and an assessment of when control is transferred to the customer.  The key revenue streams are from government funding, advertising revenue and sponsorships. Revenue is recognised either when the performance obligation in the contract has been performed  (‘point in time’ or ‘over time’) as control of the performance obligation is transferred to the customer.  Advertising revenue is recognised at a point in time when the advertisement is broadcast, with revenue  for the delivery of other services and other revenue at the time the service is delivered. Revenue from  the sale of goods is recognised at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer.  The transaction price is the total amount of consideration to which the Corporation expects to be  entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. The consideration  promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both.  Receivables for goods and services, which have 30 or 45 day terms, are recognised at the nominal  amounts due less any impairment allowance amount. Collectability of debts is reviewed at the end of  the reporting period. Allowances are made when collectability of the debt is no longer probable. 139 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 140 ===== 1.2B	 Rental income  2024 2023 $’000 $’000 Total operating lease income 1,628 1,546 Maturity analysis of operating lease income receivables (undiscounted): Within 1 year 1,639 1,607 One to two years 1,602 1,580 Two to three years 1,308 1,544 Three to four years 177 1,261 Four to five years - 166 Total undiscounted lease payments receivable 4,726 6,158 The Corporation leases out a small proportion of its owned properties (refer to Note 2.2A) and has  classified these leases as operating leases because they do not transfer substantially all of the risks and  rewards incidental to the ownership of the assets. Each lease contains an initial non-cancellable period  and subsequent further terms; as well as lease renewal clauses (with a minimum 3-6 month notification  period) and are subject to CPI, fixed, and market rent reviews. There were no sub-leases as at 30 June  2024.

Notes to the Financial Statements (continued) 142 142 SBS ANNUAL REPORT  ===== PAGE 143 ===== 2.2A	 Reconciliation of the opening and closing balances of owned property, plant and equipment  and intangibles (continued) Revaluations of non-financial assets  All revaluations were conducted in accordance with the revaluation policy stated at Note 4.2. The triennial comprehensive valuation of Plant and Equipment was performed by an independent valuer  effective 30 June 2024. A desktop Land and Buildings valuation and materiality review on Leasehold  Improvements, including Make Good provisions was also performed by an independent valuer for the  current year. Contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant, equipment and other intangibles At 30 June 2024, the Corporation had a total contractual commitment of $1.406m (2023: $1.959m) for the  acquisition of television and radio broadcasting equipment, and building improvements.  The Corporation had a total of $Nil contractual commitments (2023: $0.008m) for the acquisition of  intangible assets.  Accounting Policy Acquisition of assets Assets are recorded at cost on acquisition except as stated below. The cost of acquisition includes  the fair value of assets transferred in exchange and liabilities undertaken. Financial assets are initially  measured at their fair value plus transaction costs where appropriate.  Assets acquired at no cost, or for nominal consideration, are initially recognised as assets and income  at their fair value at the date of acquisition, unless acquired as a consequence of restructuring of  administrative arrangements. In the latter case, assets are initially recognised as contributions by  owners at the amounts at which they were recognised in the transferor’s accounts immediately prior to  the restructuring. Asset recognition threshold Purchases of property, plant and equipment are recognised initially at cost in the Statement of Financial  Position, except for purchases costing less than $2,000, which are expensed in the year of acquisition  (other than where they form part of a group of similar items which are significant in total). The initial cost of an asset includes an estimate of the cost of dismantling and removing the item and  restoring the site on which it is located. This is particularly relevant to ‘make good’ provisions in property  leases taken up by the Corporation where there exists an obligation to restore the property to its original  condition. These costs are included in the value of the Corporation’s leasehold improvements with a  corresponding provision for the ‘make good’ recognised at net present value.   Revaluations Following initial recognition at cost, property, plant and equipment (excluding ROU assets) are carried at  fair value less subsequent accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Valuations  are conducted with sufficient frequency to ensure that the carrying amounts of assets did not differ  materially from the assets’ fair values as at the reporting date. The regularity of independent valuations  depended upon the volatility of movements in market values for the relevant assets.  Revaluation adjustments are made on a class basis. Any revaluation increment is credited to equity  under the heading of asset revaluation reserve except to the extent that it reversed a previous  revaluation decrement of the same asset class that was previously recognised in the surplus.  Revaluation decrements for a class of assets are recognised directly in the Statement of Comprehensive  Income surplus except to the extent that they reversed a previous revaluation increment for that class. 143 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 144 ===== 2.2A	 Reconciliation of the opening and closing balances of owned property, plant and equipment  and intangibles (continued) 	 For property, any accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date was eliminated against  the gross carrying amount of the asset and the asset was restated to the revalued amount. For  plant and equipment, the cost and accumulated depreciation of the asset was proportionately  adjusted to reflect the revalued amount. Fair value measurement Asset Class Fair value measured at Land Market selling price Buildings excl. leasehold improvements Income approach Leasehold improvements Depreciated replacement cost Plant and equipment Market selling price or depreciated replacement cost Depreciation Depreciable property, plant and equipment assets are written-off to their estimated residual values  over their estimated useful lives to the Corporation using, in all cases, the straight-line method of  depreciation.  Depreciation rates (useful lives), residual values and methods are reviewed at each reporting date  and necessary adjustments are recognised in the current, or current and future reporting periods,  as appropriate. Depreciation rates applying to each class of depreciable asset are based on the following useful lives: Class of non-financial assets 2023-2024 Avg 2022-2023 Avg Buildings 50 years 50 50 years 50 Leasehold improvements Lease term 15 Lease term 15 Property, plant and equipment 3 to 20 years 7 3 to 20 years 7 Intangibles   (excluding goodwill and trademark) 5 to 7 years 6 5 to 7 years 6 The aggregate amount of depreciation allocated for each class of asset during the reporting period is  disclosed in the reconciliation of the opening and closing balances of property, plant and equipment and  intangibles of this note. Leasehold improvements are amortised on a straight-line basis over the shorter of either the unexpired  period of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements. Impairment All assets were assessed for impairment at 30 June 2024. Where indications of impairment exist, the  asset’s recoverable amount is estimated and an impairment adjustment made if the asset’s recoverable  amount is less than its carrying amount. The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in  use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset.  Derecognition An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no further future  economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.

These assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and  accumulated impairment losses. Software is amortised on a straight-line basis over its anticipated useful life. All software assets were  assessed for indications of impairment as at 30 June 2024. The useful lives of the Corporation’s software  are 5 to 7 years (2023: 5 to 7 years). Goodwill is recognised on the purchase of a business unit in accordance with AASB 3 “Business  Combinations”. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually.  Contract rights are amortised over their anticipated useful lives (6 years). The trademark is not amortised  as it has an indefinite useful life, but is tested for impairment annually. 2.2B	 Reconciliation of the opening and closing balances of right-of-use assets Buildings Plant and  equipment Total $’000 $’000 $’000 As at 1 July 2023 Gross book value  11,968 38,387 50,355 Accumulated depreciation       (4,326) (10,456) (14,782) Total as at 1 July 2023 7,642 27,931 35,573 Depreciation (1,538) (2,091) (3,629) Additions1           852                      28                880 Other movements2           (82) (11,225) (11,307) Total as at 30 June 2024 6,874 14,643 21,517 Total as at 30 June 2024 represented by Gross book value 12,676 20,605 33,281 Accumulated depreciation      (5,802)               (5,962)         (11,764) Total as at 30 June 2024 6,874 14,643 21,517 1.

Lease Right-of-Use (ROU) Assets Leased ROU assets are capitalised at the commencement date of the lease and comprise of the  initial lease liability amount, initial direct costs incurred when entering into the lease less any lease  incentives received. An impairment review is undertaken for any ROU lease asset that shows indicators of impairment and an  impairment loss is recognised against any ROU lease asset that is impaired. Lease ROU assets continue  to be measured at cost after initial recognition in Commonwealth agency, General Government Sector  and Whole of Government financial statements. The depreciation rates for right-of-use assets are based on the commencement date to the earlier of the  end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. 145 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 146 ===== 2.2C	 Program inventories 2024 2023 Notes $’000  $’000 Program acquisitions  (i) 23,847 28,077 Commissioned programs  (i) 54,847 43,940 Commissioned programs – in progress 17,320 26,808 Prepaid program rights (ii) 4,727 4,896 Total inventories (iii) 100,741    103,721 (i)	 Program inventory balances are net of cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment.

A lease is defined as a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to use an asset (the  underlying asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Once it has been determined that a contract is, or contains a lease, the lease liability is initially measured  at the present value of the lease payments unpaid at the commencement date, discounted using the  interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate is readily determinable, or the Department of Finance zero  coupon bond yields. Subsequent to initial measurement, the liability will be reduced for payments made and increased  for interest. It is remeasured to reflect any reassessment or modification to the lease. When the lease  liability is remeasured, the corresponding adjustment is reflected in the right-of-use asset or profit and  loss depending on the nature of the reassessment or modification. 3.	 People and relationships This section describes a range of employment and post-employment benefits provided to our people  and our relationships with other key people. 3.1	 Employee provisions 2024 2023 $’000 $’000 Leave 36,451 34,852 Separation and redundancies 1,332 1,132 Total employee provisions 37,783 35,984 Accounting Policy Liabilities for short-term employee benefits and termination benefits expected within 12 months of the  end of the reporting period are measured at their nominal amounts.  Other long-term employee benefits are measured as net total of the present value of the defined  benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period minus the fair value at the end of the reporting  period of plan assets (if any) out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. The discount rates used in valuing leave liabilities are based on Australian government bond rates with  maturities that closely align with the length of the liability. The Corporation regularly reviews leave  liabilities and the impact of any adjustment to bond rates on these balances. Leave liabilities are also  impacted by assumptions surrounding future salary inflation. The Corporation regularly monitors factors  that are likely to impact future salary inflation. Leave The liability for employee benefits includes provision for annual leave and long service leave. The leave  liabilities are calculated on the basis of employees’ remuneration at the estimated salary rates that will  be applied at the time the leave is taken, including the entity’s employer superannuation contribution  rates to the extent that the leave is likely to be taken during service rather than paid out on termination. The liability for long service leave was determined by reference to the work of an actuary as at 30  June 2024. The estimate of the present value of the liability takes into account attrition rates and pay  increases through promotion and inflation. Separation and redundancy Provision is made for separation and redundancy benefit payments. The Corporation recognises a  provision for termination when it has developed a detailed formal plan for the terminations and has  informed those employees affected that it will carry out the terminations. Notes to the Financial Statements (continued) 148 148 SBS ANNUAL REPORT  ===== PAGE 149 ===== Superannuation The Corporation’s staff are members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS), the Public  Sector Superannuation Scheme (PSS), or the PSS accumulation plan (PSSap), or other superannuation  funds held outside the Australian Government. The CSS and PSS are defined benefit schemes for the Australian Government. The PSSap is a defined  contribution scheme. The liability for defined benefits is recognised in the financial statements of the Australian Government  and is settled by the Australian Government in due course. This liability is reported in the Department of  Finance’s administered schedules and notes. The Corporation makes employer contributions to the employees’ defined benefit superannuation  scheme at rates determined by an actuary to be sufficient to meet the current cost to the  Government. The Corporation accounts for the contributions as if they were contributions to defined  contribution plans. The liability for superannuation recognised as at 30 June per Note 2.3A represents  outstanding contributions. 3.2	 Key management personnel remuneration Key management personnel are those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing  and controlling the activities of the entity, directly or indirectly, including any director (whether executive  or otherwise) of that entity. The Corporation has determined the key management personnel to be its  Board Directors, the Managing Director and management responsible for the authority and responsibility  for planning, directing and controlling activities of the entity. Key management personnel remuneration  is reported in the table below:  2024 2023 $ $ Short–term employee benefits 3,386,705 3,093,113 Post-employment benefits  341,259 367,328 Other long-term benefits 96,166 74,565 Total key management personnel remuneration expenses  3,824,130 3,535,006 The total numbers of key management personnel that are included in the above table are 16 individuals  (2023: 17 individuals). The above key management personnel remuneration excludes the remuneration  and other benefits of the Portfolio Minister. The Portfolio Minister’s remuneration and other benefits are  set by the Remuneration Tribunal and are not paid by the Corporation.  3.3	 Related party disclosures 3.3A	 Related party relationships The Corporation is an Australian Government controlled entity. Related parties to the Corporation are  Directors (executive or otherwise), key management personnel including Cabinet Ministers, the Portfolio  Minister and other Australian Government entities.  3.3B	 Transactions with related parties Given the breadth of Government activities, related parties may transact with the Government sector in  the same capacity as ordinary citizens. Such transactions include the payment of goods and services  taxes and fringe benefits taxes. National DAB Licence Company Limited (DAB), incorporated for the purpose of purchasing and  managing the Digital Radio multiplex transmitter licence for digital radio broadcasting, is a joint venture  company between the Corporation and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), each having a  50% equity interest. DAB is funded by the Corporation and the ABC to cover administrative expenses.  Given consideration to relationships with related entities and transactions entered into during the  reporting period by the Corporation, it has been determined that there are no other related party  transactions to be separately disclosed. 149 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 150 ===== 4.

No financial asset was  pledged, nor held as collateral, in 2024 (2023: Nil). The Corporation has established financial risk management policies to identify and analyse the risks  faced by the Corporation in maximising its return on investments.  Notes to the Financial Statements (continued) Accounting Policy Financial assets In accordance with AASB 9 Financial Instruments, the Corporation classified its financial assets as  financial assets measured at amortised cost. The classification depends on both the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and  contractual cash flow characteristics at the time of initial recognition. Financial assets are recognised  when the Corporation becomes a party to the contract and, as a consequence, has a legal right to  receive and derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire  or are transferred upon trade date.  Financial assets at amortised cost Financial assets included in this category need to meet two criteria: 1.	 the financial asset is held in order to collect the contractual cash flows; and 2.	 the cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal outstanding Amortised cost is determined using the effective interest method. 150 150 SBS ANNUAL REPORT  ===== PAGE 151 ===== Impairment of financial assets Financial assets are assessed for impairment at the end of each reporting period based on Expected  Credit Losses, using the general approach which measures the loss allowance based on an amount  equal to lifetime expected credit losses where risk has significantly increased, or an amount equal to  12-month expected credit losses if risk has not increased.  A simplified approach for trade, contract and lease receivables is used. This approach always measures  the loss allowance as the amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses. A write-off constitutes a derecognition event where the write-off directly reduces the gross carrying  amount of the financial asset. Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities ‘at fair value through profit or loss’ or other  financial liabilities. Financial liabilities are recognised and derecognised upon ‘trade date’. Financial liabilities at amortised cost Financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs. These liabilities are  subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense  recognised on an effective interest basis. Supplier and other payables are recognised at amortised cost. Liabilities are recognised to the extent  that the goods or services have been received (and irrespective of having been invoiced). 4.1B	 Net gains or losses on financial assets 2024 2023 $’000 $’000 Financial assets at amortised cost  Interest revenue 8,775 4,720 Impairment of trade and other receivables (5) (6) Foreign exchange losses (22)  (4) Net gains on financial assets 8,748 4,710 There were no other gains or losses arising from financial assets.  151 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 152 ===== 4.2	 Fair value measurement The following tables provide an analysis of assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. The  remaining assets and liabilities disclosed in the Statement of Financial Position do not apply the fair  value hierarchy. 4.2A	 Fair value measurement  Accounting Policy Valuations are conducted with sufficient frequency to ensure that the carrying amounts of assets do  not differ materially from the assets’ fair values as at the reporting date. The regularity of independent  valuations is dependent upon the volatility of movements in market values for the relevant assets. The Corporation deems transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy to have occurred at the end  of the reporting period in line with AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement. Fair value measurements  at the end of reporting period (i) 2024 2023 Notes $’000 $’000 Non-financial assets (ii) Land (Craigieburn)  (iii) 8,800        9,200 Land (Artarmon) 50,000      50,000 Buildings on freehold land 42,500      45,500 Leasehold improvements 6,802        7,494 Other plant and equipment 18,199      17,808 Total fair value measurements of non-financial   assets in the Statement of Financial Position 126,301 130,002 Notes: (i)	 The Corporation did not measure any non-financial assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis as at  30 June 2024. (ii)	 The Corporation undertakes a comprehensive valuation of Property, Plant and Equipment at least  once every three years. If a particular asset class experiences significant and volatile changes in  fair value (i.e. where indicators suggest that the value of the class has changed materially since the  previous reporting period), that class is subject to specific valuation in the reporting period, where  practicable, regardless of the timing of the last specific valuation. (iii)	Fair value measurements - highest and best use differs from current use for non-financial assets. The  existing use of the Corporation’s land holding in Craigieburn as a transmission site is not considered to  be equivalent to its highest and best use. However, its fair value measurement has been assessed at  the asset’s highest and best use is for residential development in accordance with the requirements of  AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement. Notes to the Financial Statements (continued) 152 152 SBS ANNUAL REPORT  ===== PAGE 153 ===== Significant inputs utilised by the Corporation are derived and evaluated as follows: Land and Buildings Land – Price per square metre/per hectare The Artarmon and Craigieburn land assets have been measured using the market approach by  reference to similar transactions within the surrounding locality. The adopted price per square metre has  been determined based on professional judgement regarding the comparability of transactions to the  subject asset. The existing use of the property at Artarmon is currently considered to be its highest and  best use. The land asset at Craigieburn is not currently used at its highest and best use. The Corporation valued  the land at its highest and best use (i.e. a residential subdivision) as at 30 June 2024. The asset is subject  to an encumbrance (lease) until 2028, which is a restriction that would pass to a market participant. The  fair value measurement has therefore considered this restriction in the valuation. Buildings – Market Rental and Capitalisation Rate The income capitalisation approach has been adopted to determine the fair value of the buildings asset  class. Under the income capitalisation approach the net market rental is capitalised at an appropriate  yield as determined from comparable sales transactions. The analysis and selection of an appropriate  market rental and yield from evidence with varying degrees of comparability to the subject property is  determined based on professional judgement. Plant and Equipment – Consumed economic benefit/Obsolescence of asset Assets that do not transact with enough frequency or transparency to develop objective opinions of  value from observable market evidence have been measured utilising the depreciated replacement  cost (DRC) approach. Under the DRC approach the estimated cost to replace the asset is calculated and  then adjusted to take into account its consumed economic benefit/asset obsolescence (accumulated  depreciation). Consumed economic benefit/asset obsolescence has been determined based on  professional judgement regarding physical, economic and external obsolescence factors relevant to the  asset under consideration.  The weighted average is determined by assessing the fair value measurement as a proportion of the  total fair value for the class against the total useful life of each asset. 153 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 154 ===== 5.

Accounting Policy Contingent liabilities and contingent assets are not recognised in the Statement of Financial Position but  are reported in the notes. They may arise from uncertainty as to the existence of a liability or asset or  represent an asset or liability in respect of which the amount cannot be reliably measured. Contingent  assets are disclosed when settlement is probable but not virtually certain and contingent liabilities are  disclosed when settlement is greater than remote. 155 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ===== PAGE 156 ===== 7.	 Budgetary reports and explanations of major variances  7.1	 Budgetary reports The following tables provide a comparison between the 2023-24 Portfolio Budget Statements (PBS)  budget and the final financial outcome in the 2023-24 financial statements. The Budget is not audited. Variances are considered to be ‘major’ based on the following criteria: 	 — the variance between budget and actual is greater than 10%; and 	 — the variance between budget and actual is greater than 2% of the relevant category (Income,  Expenses and Equity totals); or 	 — an item below this threshold but is considered important for the reader’s understanding or is  relevant to an assessment of the discharge of accountability and to an analysis of performance  of the Corporation.

Remuneration policy and practices SBS is committed to ensuring that remuneration  packages properly reflect a person’s duties and key  responsibilities. We will also ensure that remuneration  reflects a link to an individual’s performance and that  remuneration is benchmarked considering similar  roles internally, similar roles externally and against  comparable and/or similar organisations. With regard  to the SBS Board of Directors, Managing Director and  Executive Committee: • The remuneration of the SBS Board of Directors is  determined by the Commonwealth Remuneration  Tribunal • The Managing Director’s remuneration is set by the  Commonwealth Remuneration Tribunal and the SBS  Board of Directors under the guidance of the SBS  Board Remuneration Committee • Remuneration for senior executive employees  and other highly paid staff is determined upon  appointment and reviewed through annual salary  review and benchmarking activities. Remuneration governance arrangements • The SBS Board Remuneration Committee is a  subcommittee of the SBS Board of Directors • The subcommittee is responsible for setting  the remuneration of the Managing Director and  overseeing the remuneration of the SBS Executive  Committee. The subcommittee is comprised of members of the  SBS Board as follows: • Deputy Chair • Managing Director • Non-Executive Director • Non-Executive Director Remuneration arrangement for other highly paid  employees is governed by the appropriate financial  delegations with review and approval required by  Divisional Directors, or the Director of People and  Culture or the Managing Director. Basis for determining remuneration Remuneration framework The SBS remuneration framework consists of  predominantly fixed components with sales positions  eligible for at risk bonus or commission components  based on performance. Base salary is determined  based on a range of factors including: job description,  job hierarchy, work value, individual performance,  competence and skill and other internal and external  market factors. SBS also utilises independent external  remuneration benchmarking data representative  of media and general industry from a number of  relevant sources dependent on the role and availability  of market data. For those eligible for an at risk  component, payment is based on the achievement of  pre-determined key result areas. Annual remuneration review SBS reviews remuneration annually for employees.  Divisional Directors, the Director of People and Culture  and the Managing Director review and approve  adjustments in line with management delegations. The  remuneration review process considers: • Match to market comparison (media industry where  relevant and general industry) • Individual performance and contribution • Gender equity within like-for-like roles • Organisational performance and affordability • Remuneration competitiveness.
