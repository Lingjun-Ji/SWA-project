We have a costed plan to decarbonise our Australian terrestrial iron ore operations in the Pilbara  by 2030. At the time of this report, Fortescue has identified the solutions it plans to adopt to  eliminate approximately 90% of terrestrial Scope 1 and 2 emissions from its Australian iron ore  operations. We are actively working to identify solutions for the final approximately 10%.  We are also finalising our plan for how to eliminate Fortescue’s remaining Scope 1 and 2  emissions from across our operations, including Fortescue Energy.  From FY24 onwards, Fortescue will no longer buy voluntary carbon offsets unless required  by law, as offsets have been shown to be troubled by extensive concerns about quality, lack of  additionality and an inability to deliver real reductions in emissions. Through Fortescue Energy, we are also going to give the world an alternative to fossil fuels.

The lowest levels of Antarctic Sea ice ever observed and  at time of writing, sea ice that should have been the size of  Western Australia not replaced as usual during the Antarctic  winter. The hottest June on record, peaking at 1.69˚C above pre  industrial era and our hottest year. July 2023 was also the  hottest month on record, over 1.5°C warmer on average  than in pre-industrial times. Work has had to stop in parts  of China and New York was shrouded in orange smoke as a  record area of Canada burned. Over the next five years, the world has a 66 per cent chance  of passing 1.5˚C for one or all years. These scenes are already  our new normal and the higher temperatures rise, the worse  they will become. We sit at the tipping point of global warming and global  mindsets – one that will see decarbonisation shift abruptly  from a “nice to have” to essential to our existence. Fortescue chose to lead the world through our unique  decarbonisation and green energy strategy and expansion  into new, global iron ore markets. In June 2023, our Belinga project delivered first ore on  train – just four months after the convention was signed.  This massive project will one day be among the largest iron  ore mines in the world and will complement our Australian  operations, enhancing our blended products and opening  new global markets.  ===== PAGE 9 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    7 Corporate governance Operating and   financial review Corporate directory Ore Reserves and  Mineral Resources Our approach to   sustainability Our approach to   climate change Directors' report    |  Remuneration Report  Financial report Overview In May, Fortescue also launched its first high-grade  magnetite project, Iron Bridge, with a maiden concentrate  grade of over 68% far exceeding our target of 67%. Fortescue has also made some extraordinary achievements  in 2023 accelerating towards our 2030 Real Zero target to  eliminate fossil fuels from our mine sites and provide global  customers with a fully green iron ore product. In June, our first battery electric haul truck arrived at  Christmas Creek. Roadrunner brings several firsts, including  the ability to fast-charge in 30 minutes and capacity to  regenerate power as it drives downhill. Later this year we will have our first hydrogen fuel cell haul  truck prototype on site for similar testing. In May, our retrofitted locomotive, nicknamed Locommonia,  arrived at Solomon to undergo field tests. Our 75 metre-long  Green Pioneer, which could be the world’s first ammonia- fuelled industrial ship, is set to complete final tests in coming  months. This four-stroke diesel engine has been modified to run on  green ammonia and it has taken our team just one year to  develop. The shipping and fertiliser industries alone will be huge  markets for green ammonia. In March, Fortescue Future  Industries joined forces with the Government of Kenya to  commence development of a major 300MW green ammonia  and green fertiliser project, powered by a geothermal field. In March, we also announced a pilot plant that can process  iron ore into green iron at low temperatures using just  electricity – no coal. It could revolutionise the steel industry,  which currently emits 11 per cent of global CO2. Global partnerships, particularly with China and India, will be  key to our success. China, with its highly developed robotics  and automation, is where electrolyser production could  come down the cost curve significantly as it enters the era of  machines making machines. Australia, once the green laggard, is now ahead of the curve  with a A$2 billion financial package for green hydrogen  launched in May that will see it leapfrog other countries. According to the latest report by Deloitte, the green  hydrogen market is forecast to exceed the value of liquid  natural gas by 2030. Up to 85 billion tonnes of CO2 could be  saved by 2050 through by the hydrogen industry – roughly  twice global emissions in 2021. Renewable energy and green hydrogen are set to play a very  big part of our overall earnings in the future. But change  takes a huge amount of courage. We have new horizons, new possibilities, new markets – and  new competitors. The next five years will not be easy, but  they will cement Fortescue’s position as a world leader and  the global provider of green metals, green energy and green  solutions.

Today, we are the world’s fourth largest iron ore producer,  valued at more than A$60 billion. Since 2013, our loyal  shareholders have received over A$32 billion in dividends. I intend to build on this foundation to realise the opportunity  ahead for green metals and green energy. This strong foundation is evident through Fortescue’s  operating excellence, which continues to drive strong results  across our key metrics of safety, production and cost.  This year, Fortescue again delivered record shipments of   192 million tonnes, achieving the top end of market guidance.  Importantly, we achieved this safely, maintaining   a Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate of 1.8.  We see a new, significant and unprecedented market growing. Demand for green iron ore, green steel and critical minerals  such as copper, lithium and rare earths is soaring. Demand for  steel alone is set to rise over 60 per cent in the next 25 years.  “Demand for green iron  ore, green steel and  critical minerals such as  copper, lithium and rare  earths is soaring. Demand  for steel alone is set to   rise over 60 per cent in   the next 25 years.” DINO OTRANTO Twenty years ago, Fortescue  was created to address a gap  in the marketplace Solomon Mine  Ore Processing  Facility  ===== PAGE 12 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    10 Overview We have always moved ahead of the markets. Twenty years  ago, Fortescue started out as a low-grade producer. With  Eliwana and Solomon, we transitioned into mid-grade.  In 2023, we have added for the first time a high-grade,  premium iron ore magnetite product to our portfolio.  Iron Bridge is Fortescue's most innovative iron ore project.  Surpassing expectations with an iron ore grade of over  68% on its first run, Iron Bridge will ultimately be Australia’s  largest magnetite project – and, once we connect it to  Pilbara renewable energy, Australia’s first magnetite project  to operate using renewable energy by 2030. In addition to the value opportunity of magnetite is the  Belinga high-grade hematite project in Gabon, on the west  coast of central Africa. We loaded first ore to train in June  2023 which keeps us on track to deliver the first shipment  of iron ore from Gabon by the end of 2023 – less than a year  after the signing of the Mining Convention. Studies continue  to advance potential designs of a large-scale development.  In 2023, Fortescue continued to make progress towards  decarbonising the steel production process and helping  to address our customers emissions, evident through  partnerships such as our Memorandum of Understanding  with the world’s largest steelmaker, China Baowu Steel  Group Corporation, to work together on reducing emissions  associated with iron and steelmaking. We are also positioning ourselves for success in critical  minerals, which are essential to electric vehicles, batteries,  magnets, wind turbines, solar panels, electrolysers and  energy efficient technologies like LEDs. Demand for these  minerals is set to grow. It is through these innovations and efficiencies that  Fortescue is positioned well and we will continue to apply   this in everything we do as we transition from being an   iron ore business into a global metals and green energy  company.

The world  needs a solution to fossil  fuels. That's us. That's green  hydrogen.” MARK HUTCHINSON Over the past 50 years we have completely trashed the  planet. I hear people talking about ''saving the planet''. The  planet will be just fine without us. It's humankind that needs  to be saved. But what is wrong with the world? They see it.  They hear it. They feel it. But the world does nothing.  The only way we can reverse climate change is to stop fossil  fuels now. Every day we continue to release more emissions  into the atmosphere, the worse the situation will get. Beyond  1.5⁰C we have no idea what will happen. No one has any idea. The reason the world stares at climate change and does  nothing, is because it doesn’t know what to do. The world  needs a solution to fossil fuels. That's us. That's green  hydrogen. We are the butterfly effect, because when we show the world  that we can make green hydrogen at scale, the world will  banish fossil fuels forever. Fortescue’s prescient decision to lead business towards the  green ‘light on the hill’ was validated in 2023 by a landslide  of climate policies signalling a global rush towards green  hydrogen and its derivatives.  This time last year there were no major green energy  incentives in place globally. We are in climate change today.  We are at 1.5⁰C now.   Not 2050, it's now Fortescue's first  prototype battery  electric truck,  Roadrunner, onsite  in  the Pilbara  ===== PAGE 14 ===== Gladstone Electrolyser  Manufacturing Facility Science and Research  team, Balcatta Research  and Development Facility ¹https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/about/press-room/new-deloitte-report-emerging-green-hydrogen-market.html ²https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/sustainability/our-insights/climate-investing-continuing-breakout-growth-through-uncertain-times Today, the USA has the US$370 billion Inflation Reduction  Act, which provides up to US$3 per kilogram of production  tax credits to green hydrogen manufacturers. Australia has  the recent A$2 billion Hydrogen Headstart package focused  on green hydrogen. In June, the European Union signed into  law its Delegated Act on green hydrogen. Our products will be essential to decarbonising the ‘toughest  third’ of emissions – steel production, long haul flights,  global shipping, fertilisers. Green hydrogen will also play  an essential role in energy storage and firming power as  countries continue to focus on energy security.  In 2023, Fortescue has prioritised certain green energy  projects in response to growing global demand. We are  focused on our target of bringing up to five of these projects  to Final Investment Decision (FID). In the United States, we have announced our first major  move following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act,  investing US$24 million to acquire a 100 per cent interest in  the Phoenix Hydrogen Hub. The Hub is a proposed green hydrogen project located  in Arizona, with Phase One planned to be an 80MW  electrolyser and liquefaction facility, capable of producing up  to 12,000 tonnes of liquified green hydrogen annually.  In Norway, we have secured a second power agreement in  the Bremanger Municipality for our planned 300MW green  hydrogen and green ammonia facility in Holmaneset.  Meanwhile in Australia, we are aiming to open our A$114  million Green Energy Manufacturing Centre in Gladstone,  Queensland by early 2024, which will produce electrolysers.  Lastly, in the UK, we are driving forward an advanced  batteries and electric powertrain manufacturing facility  to enable decarbonisation of haul trucks, trains and other  heavy industry equipment.  The green energy and green hydrogen market has the  potential to create significant growth for Fortescue. The  latest report by Deloitte¹ estimates that green hydrogen  alone will be worth more than liquid natural gas by 2030.  Private equity investment in clean hydrogen grew 460 per  cent, from less than $1 billion to $5 billion between 2019 and  2022. Climate investments in general will reach US$9 to   $12 trillion annually by 2030, according to McKinsey².  The demand for fossil fuel free energy is here – and  Fortescue is leading the way. As a first mover, we will  benefit first and create greater value for you, our valued  shareholders.

All  new Board members benefit from a comprehensive induction  process that supports their understanding of Fortescue’s  business.  Fortescue’s policy is to assess all potential Board candidates  without regard to race, gender, age, physical ability, sexuality,  nationality, religious beliefs, or any other factor not relevant to  their competence and performance.  There is also a range of support given to Board members that  enables them to stay strongly connected to Fortescue, its  culture and Values.  This includes:  •	 Opportunities for significant contribution to the annual  strategy setting process conducted with executive and  senior management.  •	 Regular briefings from executive and senior management  regarding all major business areas, tailored site visits and  annual site tours to operations. •	 Visits to meet with key customers that strengthen their  understanding of the Company’s key markets. •	 Regular formal and informal opportunities for the directors  to meet with management and staff. The Board has established committees to assist in the  execution of its duties and to ensure that important and  complex issues are given appropriate consideration. The  primary committees of the Board are the Remuneration  and People Committee, the Audit, Risk Management and  Sustainability Committee, the Nomination Committee and the  Finance Committee.  Each committee has a non-executive Chair and operates  under its own Charter which has been approved by the Board.  Directors are expected to act independently and ethically and  comply with all relevant requirements of the Corporations Act  2001, ASX Listing Rules and the Company’s Constitution. Fortescue actively promotes ethical and responsible  decision-making through its Values and Code of Conduct   and Integrity that embodies these Values.  The Board and each of its committees have established a  process to evaluate their performance annually. The process  is based on a formal questionnaire covering a range of  performance topics. The process is managed by the Company  Secretary under the direction of the Lead Independent  Director. The most recent review was undertaken in July 2023.  The results and recommendations from the evaluation of  the Board and committees are reported to the full Board for  further consideration and action, where required.  At the date of this report, the Board has five non-executive  directors and two executive directors, being Dr Andrew Forrest  AO, Fortescue's Executive Chairman, and Ms Elizabeth Gaines,  Executive Director and Global Ambassador Fortescue. The  Board believes that an appropriate mix of non-executive and  executive directors is beneficial to its role and provides strong  operational and financial insights to support the business. The appointment and reappointment of directors is intended to maintain and  enhance the overall quality of the Board through a composition that reflects a  diversity of skills, ethnicity, experience, gender and age.  ===== PAGE 17 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    15 Corporate governance Operating and   financial review Corporate directory Ore Reserves and  Mineral Resources Our approach to   sustainability Our approach to   climate change Directors' report    |  Remuneration Report  Financial report Overview Dr Andrew Forrest AO  Executive Chairman Executive Chairman and Founder of Fortescue, Minderoo  Foundation, and Tattarang Dr Andrew Forrest AO is a global business leader and  philanthropist.

THE LEADERSHIP TEAM  ===== PAGE 24 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    22 Overview ABOUT  FORTESCUE Since our founding twenty years ago, Fortescue has become  one of the world’s largest producers of iron ore – globally  recognised for its world leading approach to building  low-cost, large-scale infrastructure. We are the number 1  integrated green technology, energy and metals company. Since Fortescue’s first commercial shipment of 180,000  tonnes of iron ore departed from Port Hedland, Western  Australia to China in May 2008, Fortescue has remained  a major, integral supplier of iron ore to the Chinese steel  industry. Fortescue is now shipping at an annual rate of over  190 million tonnes with more than 1.9 billion tonnes of iron  ore delivered to its customers since 2008. Our iron ore operations include three hematite mining hubs  in the Pilbara and our Iron Bridge magnetite mine. Our three  hubs are connected by 760 kilometres of rail to Herb Elliott  Port and the Judith Street Harbour towage infrastructure in  Port Hedland. We have also just delivered first ore to ship  for our high grade magnetite project, Iron Bridge. Fortescue  operates eight purpose-built 260,000 tonne capacity ore  carriers.  Fortescue is unique within the heavy industry: we are  committed to reducing our emissions to Real Zero by  2030 across our Australian terrestrial mining operations –  eliminating fossil fuels by developing local renewable power  and replacing our existing equipment with battery electric  and green hydrogen models.  We also have a net zero Scope 3 emissions target by 2040.  Around 98 per cent of those emissions arise from crude  steel manufacturing. We are supporting the development  of technologies that will help enable our customers to  make green steel, without coal, from the full spectrum of  Fortescue’s iron ore products.  For our size and scale, there is no other mining company  in the world that is taking the action we are to eliminate  emissions.  The Fortescue group is a top 10 ASX listed company.  Fortescue has two divisions – Metals and Energy. They work  together for Fortescue as a whole, to ensure allocation of  resources is prioritised across the divisions. Our Metals  team focuses on our Australian and global iron ore deposits,  exploration into new fields and the development of green  iron technologies for future use. Fortescue Energy comprises Fortescue Future Industries  (FFI), Fortescue Hydrogen Systems and Fortescue WAE,  focuses on meeting urgent global demand for green energy,  aviation fuels, green fertilisers and green shipping fuels. In  2023, the energy business focused on bringing projects to  Final Investment Decision. Fortescue always strives to empower the communities we  operate in and deliver positive social and economic change  through training, employment and business development  opportunities. This is evident through initiatives such as our Billion  Opportunities program which has awarded more than   A$4.6 billion in contracts to First Nations businesses since it  was established in 2011. Fortescue is both a proud West   Australian company and the number 1  integrated green technology,   energy and metals company  ===== PAGE 25 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    23 Corporate governance Operating and   financial review Corporate directory Ore Reserves and  Mineral Resources Our approach to   sustainability Our approach to   climate change Directors' report    |  Remuneration Report  Financial report Overview As one of the world’s largest producers  of iron ore, Fortescue’s wholly owned  and integrated operations in the Pilbara  include the Chichester, Solomon and  Western mining hubs Our mining infrastructure is connected to the five berth Herb Elliott Port  and Judith Street Harbour towage facility in Port Hedland.

Located 145km south of Port Hedland,  Iron Bridge is Fortescue’s first magnetite operation and  incorporates the North Star and Glacier Valley magnetite   ore bodies. Unlike Fortescue’s hematite operations, Iron Bridge  produces a wet concentrate product which is transported  to Port Hedland through a 135km specialist slurry pipeline  where dewatering and materials handling occurs. In coming years, low-cost power will be delivered to Iron  Bridge through Fortescue’s investment in the Pilbara Energy  Connect project, which includes energy transmission line  infrastructure, solar gas hybrid generation and associated  battery storage solution. Iron Bridge is an unincorporated joint venture between FMG  Magnetite Pty Ltd (69 per cent) and Formosa Steel IB Pty Ltd  (31 per cent). Chichester Hub  Our Chichester Hub in the Chichester Ranges includes the  Cloudbreak and Christmas Creek mines and has an annual  production capacity of approximately 100 million tonnes per  annum (mtpa) from three ore processing facilities (OPFs).  The Christmas Creek OPF infrastructure has previously  been upgraded to include a Wet High Intensity Magnetic  Separator to recover high-grade iron from the finer ore fed  through the OPF. Cloudbreak utilises 20km of relocatable  conveyors that can be adjusted and relocated to any new  mining areas to offset the increase in costs.  Currently, this conveyor infrastructure helps to otherwise  offset a fleet increase and helps manage our product  strategy, while being cost-efficient and, when powered by  renewable energy in the future, reducing greenhouse gas  emissions. Our Chichester Hub is also home to a 60MW  solar farm which powers Fortescue’s daytime operations at  Cloudbreak and Christmas Creek, displacing around 100  million litres of diesel every year.   Solomon Hub  The Solomon Hub in the Hamersley Ranges is located 60km  north of Tom Price and 120km to the west of the Chichester  Hub. It comprises the Firetail, Kings Valley and Queens  Valley mines which together have a production capacity of  65 to 70mtpa. The expansion to Queens Valley has enabled  continued production of the Kings Fines product. Solomon  represents a valuable source of production, enabling the  blend of higher iron grade Firetail ore with ore from Eliwana  and the Chichester Hub to create Fortescue’s Blend product. Western Hub  Fortescue’s mine at Eliwana commenced operations in  December 2020 and includes a 30mtpa dry OPF and 143km  of rail linking the mine to the Hamersley rail line. Together  with its innovative low profile designed OPF and dual stacker  reclaimer, Eliwana has the capacity to direct load onto trains  up to 9,000 tonnes per hour. Eliwana is now producing at an  annualised rate of 30mt, contributing to our low cost status  and providing greater flexibility to capitalise on market  dynamics. Hedland operations  Fortescue wholly owns and operates purpose-built rail  and port facilities. The efficient design and layout, optimal  berthing configuration and ongoing innovation to increase  productivity make Herb Elliott Port an efficient bulk port  operation. The port has five operating berths and we have  been granted approval to increase the licensed throughput  capacity of Herb Elliott Port from 175mtpa to 210mtpa.  Our Judith Street Harbour towage infrastructure and fleet of  tugs provide safe and reliable towage services that maximise  the efficiency of our operations. Designed to complement  the port infrastructure, the fleet of eight 260,000 tonne  capacity Fortescue Ore Carriers delivers approximately  10 per cent of our shipping requirements, while improving  load rates and efficiencies and reducing operating costs.  Fortescue’s shipping fleet completes our mine to market iron  ore value chain.  Integrated Operations Centre  Our Fortescue Hive is a purpose-built Integrated Operations  Centre in Perth that opened in 2020 and includes Planning,  Operations and Mine Control teams, together with Port,  Rail, Shipping and Marketing teams. In FY23, the Hive was  expanded to include Iron Bridge control. The Hive operates  24 hours a day, seven days a week to deliver improved safe,  reliable, efficient and commercial outcomes.   ===== PAGE 27 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    25 Corporate governance Operating and   financial review Corporate directory Ore Reserves and  Mineral Resources Our approach to   sustainability Our approach to   climate change Directors' report    |  Remuneration Report  Financial report Overview Belinga Iron Ore Project, Gabon  The Belinga Iron Ore Project in Gabon is Fortescue’s first iron  ore project outside of Australia.  In February 2023, Fortescue, through its incorporated joint  venture company, Ivindo Iron SA, successfully signed a  Mining Convention with the Government of Gabon. This  governs all legal, fiscal and regulatory regimes for the  project. Further legislation is proposed to be enacted during  FY24 to give further effect to the above arrangements. First  ore was trained to port in June 2023 and we are on track for  first shipment by the end of calendar year 2023.  The Belinga project opens growth opportunities for  Fortescue throughout Africa. Every indication we have   shows the project has the potential to be significant scale  and high-grade. Studies continue to advance potential  designs of a large-scale development. Fortescue was founded on the belief that communities  should thrive as a result of our success. The investments  in the Belinga Iron Ore Project will bring infrastructure and  economic opportunities that will benefit national and local  communities, including through creating jobs, engaging  local businesses and providing training opportunities.  Ivindo Iron is the operating entity for the Belinga project and  Fortescue has a 72 per cent indirect interest in the company.   Critical minerals and iron ore exploration  Fortescue started as an exploration company, and we still  firmly believe that early stage exploration is the key to  unlocking significant value.  In FY23, Fortescue's exploration activities included:  •	 Continued iron ore exploration in the Pilbara, with resource  definition drilling in the Eastern Hamersley and a focus  on Nyidinghu and Mindy South and regional exploration  across the Pilbara with a focus in the Western Hub •	 Exploration activity primarily focused on early-stage  target generation for copper-gold in the Paterson region  in Western Australia •	 Additional exploration activity for copper is progressing in  South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland. International exploration  Our world class exploration capability is driving future growth  as we target global opportunities and commodities that  support decarbonisation, electrification of the transport  sector and broader opportunities, with a focus on copper,  lithium and rare earths. Fortescue has an established  presence in Latin America, including Argentina, where we  currently hold tenements prospective for copper-gold.  Fortescue also holds tenements for critical minerals in Brazil,  Chile and Peru where exploration is ongoing. Fortescue has  a 25.4 per cent stake in TSX listed Alta Copper Corp. and we  support the advancement of the Cañariaco project in Peru. In  Kazakhstan, a range of copper targets are being progressed  to drilling while work in Portugal is focused on development  of lithium opportunities. Fortescue Energy Fortescue Energy is our global green energy business. Its  focus is on producing commercial scale of green energy  and green hydrogen, including derivatives such as green  ammonia, to accelerate global decarbonisation of heavy  industry, aviation, shipping and fertilisers. We have   industry-leading targets to decarbonise Fortescue's mining  sites by 2030 for its Australian terrestrial emissions while  achieving net zero Scope 3 emissions by 2040.  We have dozens of green energy and green hydrogen  projects under investigation globally and plans to bring  projects to Final Investment Decision in 2023.  Currently, our focus is on five key regions:  •	 Phoenix, USA. Across the US, we are actively developing  several potential green hydrogen projects including near  Phoenix, Arizona.  •	 Gibson Island, Australia. With Incitec Pivot Limited, a  proposed 550MW green hydrogen and green ammonia  facility is currently in the front end engineering design  (FEED) stage. •	 Nakuru county, Kenya. A proposed, up to 300MW, steam- to-fertiliser facility utilising geothermal steam from the  Olkaria region in Nakuru county is currently in the pre- feasibility stage. The project is aimed at the production  of green fertiliser for domestic use in Kenya, with the  Government of Kenya as the sole off-taker. •	 Holmaneset, Norway. A proposed 300MW green ammonia  facility is currently in the pre-feasibility stage with  renewable energy secured via a long-term conditional  Power Purchase Agreement with Statkraft to support our  operational plans. •	 Pecem, Brazil. A proposed green hydrogen and green  ammonia facility at the Port of Pecem, Ceará, is in the   pre-feasibility phase.  ===== PAGE 28 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    26 Overview In addition to the above, we have a number of other exciting  opportunities that are being progressed and are expected to  be developed and ready for final investment decision during  2024. Other developments in FY23: •	 Construction works completed at our electrolyser  manufacturing facility, the Green Energy Manufacturing  Centre, in Gladstone, Queensland. Further fit-out of the  facility, including the automated production line and  testing facilities, has now commenced  •	 Completion of the R&D Perth Innovation Centre •	 Launch of the Colorado Innovation Centre in the USA. Decarbonisation  Fortescue released its decarbonisation roadmap in  September 2022, which aims to reduce operating costs by  eliminating expenditure in diesel, natural gas and offsets.  Fortescue is leading the market in terms of its response to  customer, community and investor expectations to reduce  and eliminate carbon emissions from its operations.  In executing our roadmap, we are using well-established  technologies and, in some cases, using those technologies  in new ways. We believe battery electric, green hydrogen and  green ammonia will all be critical, and we are taking practical  steps to apply the best solution to each different situation.  Zero-emission trucks, trains and ships •	 In FY23, Fortescue deployed our first prototypes on  site. In June, our first battery electric haul truck arrived  at Christmas Creek. Roadrunner brings several surface  mining firsts, including the ability to fast-charge in 30  minutes and capacity to store regenerated power as it  drives downhill. •	 Fortescue’s hydrogen fuel cell electric truck will be  delivered to Christmas Creek in FY24.  •	 A prototype Offboard Power Unit (to power the Liebherr  Electric Excavator previously delivered to site) and a  prototype 3MW Fast Charger have also been transported  to Christmas Creek to continue commissioning and site- based testing. •	 In May 2023, our dual-fuel ammonia-powered locomotive  arrived at Solomon to undergo field tests. Commissioning  of the locomotive is being completed in readiness for  mainline trials in FY24. We are continuing to explore the  development of a world-first Infinity Train which would  use gravitational energy to recharge its battery electric  systems without any additional charging requirements. •	 In FY23, Fortescue Energy continued to develop a   dual-fuel ammonia powered ship engine. In the second  half of calendar year 2023, it will undergo its first sea trials  onboard the 75 metre Green Pioneer. Green iron and green steel The global interest in green iron and green steel is growing  rapidly. As part of our commitment to achieving our Scope  3 emissions target, we are working with our customers  to reduce their carbon emissions. For example, in FY23,  Fortescue announced a Memorandum of Understanding  with China Baowu, Fortescue’s largest customer and  the largest steelmaker in the world, to work together on  reducing emissions associated with iron and steelmaking. We are also conducting R&D to develop technologies  needed to decarbonise the iron used to make steel. In FY23,  we developed a pilot installation capable of converting  iron ore to green iron without coal, with several patent  applications filed. The process uses low-temperature  electrolysis, which can be powered using renewable  electricity and offers a potential pathway to enable the full  spectrum of Fortescue’s iron ore products to be converted  into green iron. Renewable power on our mining sites The Pilbara Energy Connect (PEC) project, together with the  Chichester Solar Gas Hybrid Project, will deliver 25 per cent  of our stationary energy requirements from solar power by  FY25. The project will enable renewable electricity generated  at any of Fortescue’s sites to move between our operations  in Port Hedland, Iron Bridge, Cloudbreak, Christmas Creek,  Solomon and Eliwana, via over 500km of transmission lines.  The following project milestones were achieved in FY23: •	 North Star Junction to Port Hedland: 98km of  transmission lines and a 220kV substation now  constructed. •	 North Star Junction: construction of a 100MW solar plant  underway, with commissioning in 2024.  •	 Solomon to Eliwana: Board approval was received for  construction of 132km of transmission line and a 220kV  substation scheduled to start this year.  •	 Lambda to Cloudbreak and Christmas Creek: Board  approval has been received, with procurement underway  and construction of 111km of transmission lines and two  220kV substations to start in 2024. The project complements the Chichester Solar Gas Hybrid  Project, which was completed in 2021 and provides up to  100 per cent of Christmas Creek’s and Cloudbreak’s daytime  energy needs, displacing around 100 million litres of diesel  every year.   ===== PAGE 29 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    27 Corporate governance Operating and   financial review Corporate directory Ore Reserves and  Mineral Resources Our approach to   sustainability Our approach to   climate change Directors' report    |  Remuneration Report  Financial report Overview IRON ORE VALUE CHAIN Exploration  and discovery Challenging geological  thinking to identify  valuable deposits Extraction and  recovery Innovative use of  technology suitable to  Fortescue’s deposits Processing Ore processing  facility design and  wet processing  optimise output Marketing Helping customers  achieve best value  in use Shiploading 3 shiploaders and   5 berths maximise outload  capacity and utilisation Mine to port Heavy haul rail  at 42t axle load Blending and  stockpiling Port design  facilitates blending  and stockpiling of  product suite Modelling,  planning and  development China port sales FMG Trading  Shanghai Co.

During the period, 1.4mt of ore was mined at Iron Bridge. 1  Volume references are based on wet metric tonnes. Product is shipped with approximately 8 to 9 per cent moisture. FORTESCUE  METALS Record shipping and production output reflecting  optimisation and consistency across the value chain Fortescue achieved record annual shipments of 192mt  through consistent performance from existing operations.  Ore mining decreased in FY23 to 218mt (FY22: 229mt).  Increasing strip ratio (FY23: 1.5x, FY22 1.4x) reflects the  sequence of ore and waste mining and was consistent with  both the annual and Life of Mine plan and development  of new mining areas. Development work continues within  Western Hub at Flying Fish and at the Chichester Hub with  Garden and Hall. Development of these areas to optimise  systems capacity aligns with Fortescue’s product strategy  while also managing operating and capital costs. Ore processing is an annual record at 192mt. This  achievement reflects consistent performance and reliability  through existing OPFs. Fortescue has a combination of both  wet and dry OPFs across its operations aligning with the  characteristics of the ore bodies.  Fortescue’s record shipments of 192mt was 3mt above the  previous record set in FY22 (189mt). The record shipping  reflects stable and consistent performance from all  operations achieving planned production output combined  with leveraging available inventory within the value chain.  Fortescue’s ore carriers continue to perform, shipping 18.9mt  in FY23 (18.9mt in FY22). Sales via Fortescue’s wholly owned Chinese sales entity,  FMG Trading Shanghai was 16.7mt in FY23 (FY22: 18.5mt  sold). This entity allows Fortescue to improve iron ore sales  channels through the direct supply of products to Chinese  customers in smaller volumes in renminbi, directly from  regional ports.  Marketing and product strategy  Fortescue’s integrated operations and customer-focused  marketing strategy underpins the Company’s ongoing  strong market penetration, with a product portfolio that  meets customer requirements and maximises value. While  China remains Fortescue’s core focus, representing more  than 50 per cent of global steel production, the Company  continues to explore sales to other markets. Innovation and technology Fortescue has led the way globally in embracing automation  at its operations. Fortescue maintains its position as a leader  in autonomous haulage, with over 190 trucks operating  across the Solomon and Chichester hubs.  The introduction of automation has not only contributed to  a safer working environment for our team members, it has  also underpinned significant productivity and efficiency  improvements. The Company continues to look for other opportunities  for automation and artificial intelligence to drive greater  efficiency across the business, including the use of data to  predict outcomes and optimise performance, the expansion  of autonomy to fixed plant and non-mining equipment and  the application of relocatable conveyor technology.    ===== PAGE 34 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    32 Operating and financial review Decarbonisation In September 2022, we updated our heavy industry  decarbonisation strategy, aiming to eliminate fossil fuel use  and achieve real zero terrestrial emissions (Scope 1 and 2)  across our Australian iron ore operations by 2030.  Consistent with our disciplined approach to capital  allocation, Fortescue’s Board approved US$6.2 billion  investment in our decarbonisation roadmap, which is  expected to reduce operating costs while future proofing our  business against carbon regulatory risk.  As part of the investment, we intend to deploy an additional  2-3 GW of renewable energy generation and battery storage,  in addition to the estimated incremental costs associated  with green mining fleet and locomotives. Fortescue remains committed to our stated intent to achieve  net zero Scope 3 emissions by 2040 (announced in October  2021), addressing emissions across our entire global value  chain, including crude steel manufacturing which accounts  for 98 per cent of our Scope 3 emissions. The acquisition of Fortescue WAE was completed in 2022.  Fortescue WAE, a leading provider of high-performance  battery and electrification technologies, is an important  acquisition that enables us to accelerate the decarbonisation  of its mining fleet as well as establish a new business growth  opportunity. Fortescue is making significant progress on our  decarbonisation initiatives, enabled through Fortescue  Energy. The key milestones on our journey to step beyond fossil fuels  achieved during FY23 include: •	 First delivery of a battery electric haul truck prototype to  Christmas Creek for site-based testing. •	 We have further refined a hydrogen-powered haul truck,  as well as retrofitted a locomotive engine to run partly on  ammonia, with the locomotive deployed at Christmas Creek in  May 2023.  •	 We have successfully modified a diesel ship engine to run on  green ammonia and we plan to carry out first sea trials later  this year on board the Green Pioneer. This builds on the progress that has already been made to  decarbonise our iron ore operations:  •	 Chichester Solar Gas Hybrid Project which displaces around  100 million litres of diesel per annum. •	 Investment in the Pilbara Energy Connect program which is  estimated to provide 25 per cent of stationary daytime energy  across our mining operations through solar power. •	 Partnering with Liebherr for the development and supply of  green mining haul trucks.  Key considerations for our pathway to decarbonise include  technology and development, future equipment acquisition and  potential regulatory changes. Future changes to Fortescue’s  decarbonisation strategy may impact key estimates and  changes to asset carrying values.  ===== PAGE 35 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    33 Corporate governance Operating and   financial review Corporate directory Our approach to   sustainability Our approach to   climate change Directors' report    |  Remuneration Report  Financial report Overview Ore Reserves and  Mineral Resources Exploration Fortescue began as an exploration company and today our  iron ore tenements remain key to maintaining mine life and  sustaining product quality in our core iron ore business.  Fortescue holds the largest tenement portfolio in the Pilbara  region of Western Australia. The resources in both the  Western Hub and Eastern Hamersley include significant  amounts of high iron content bedded iron ore, adding dry,   low-cost tonnes to Fortescue’s product suite.  Iron ore exploration activity in the Pilbara during FY23 included  resource definition drilling in the Eastern Hamersley, with a  focus on the program at Mindy South and Nyidinghu, along  with regional exploration programs including Wyloo North in  the Western Hub and White Knight which is located west of  Cloudbreak. In the critical minerals portfolio, Fortescue is ramping up  exploration activities with a key focus on copper, rare earths  and lithium.  Exploration for Australian copper-gold portfolio continues  with drilling programs underway, including the Isdell  projects in the Patterson Province of Western Australia.   Early stage target generation activities were also completed  across the South Australian and New South Wales projects  while tenements for copper and lithium were pegged in  Queensland. International exploration include drilling programs across  project areas in Argentina, Chile, Brazil and Kazakhstan. Projects Iron Bridge The Iron Bridge magnetite mine, when operating at full  capacity, is projected to deliver 22mt per annum of   high-grade, low-impurity 67% Fe magnetite concentrate.   Iron Bridge is an unincorporated joint venture between FMG  Magnetite Pty Ltd (69 per cent), and Formosa Steel IB Pty Ltd  (31 per cent). Iron Bridge commenced production of high-grade magnetite  concentrate during the last quarter of FY23 and first  concentrate was loaded on ship on 24 July 2023. Iron Bridge represents a strategic investment for Fortescue  and its joint venture partner. It enables Fortescue’s entry into  the high-grade segment of the iron ore market, providing  an enhanced product range while also increasing annual  production and shipping capacity. Belinga Iron Ore Project, Gabon The Belinga Iron Ore Project in Gabon is Fortescue’s first iron  ore project outside of Australia.  In February 2023, Fortescue, through its incorporated joint  venture company, Ivindo Iron SA, successfully signed a Mining  Convention with the Government of Gabon. This governs all  legal, fiscal and regulatory regimes for the project. Further  legislation is proposed to be enacted during FY24 to give  further effect to the above arrangements. First ore was trained  to port in June 2023 and we are on track for first shipment by  the end of calendar year 2023.  The Belinga project opens growth opportunities for Fortescue  throughout Africa. Every indication we have   shows the project has the potential to be significant scale and  high-grade. Studies continue to advance potential designs of  a large-scale development. Fortescue was founded on the belief that communities should  thrive as a result of our success. The investments in the  Belinga Iron Ore Project will bring infrastructure and economic  opportunities that will benefit national and local communities,  including through creating jobs, engaging local businesses  and providing training opportunities.  Ivindo Iron is the operating entity for the Belinga project and  Fortescue has a 72 per cent indirect interest in the company.    ===== PAGE 36 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    34 Operating and financial review Fortescue Energy is comprised of Fortescue Future  Industries, Fortescue Hydrogen Systems and Fortescue  WAE.

Key achievements in FY23 include: •	 First delivery of a battery electric haul truck prototype to  Christmas Creek for site-based testing.  •	 Fortescue WAE is working on the delivery of a   world-leading, regenerating battery electric iron ore train.  •	 We have further refined a hydrogen-powered haul truck,  as well as retrofitted a locomotive engine to run partly  on ammonia, with the locomotive deployed at Christmas  Creek in May 2023.  •	 We have successfully modified a diesel ship engine to run  on green ammonia and we plan to carry out first sea trials  later this year on board the Green Pioneer. •	 We plan to expand our operations to include two new  facilities in the United Kingdom, one in Kidlington and  the other in Banbury. The Kidlington facility will focus on  prototype development of power systems for multiple  green mobility applications. The Banbury facility will focus  on manufacturing heavy industry, zero-emission battery  modules and fully assembled power systems. Green steel The global interest in green iron and green steel is  growing rapidly globally. As part of our commitment to  achieving our Scope 3 emissions target, we are working  with our customers to reduce their carbon emissions. For  example, in FY23, Fortescue announced a Memorandum  of Understanding with China Baowu, Fortescue’s largest  customer and the largest steelmaker in the world, to work  together on reducing emissions associated with iron and  steelmaking. We are also conducting R&D to develop technologies  needed to decarbonise the iron used to make steel. In FY23,  we developed a pilot installation capable of converting  iron ore to green iron without coal, with several patent  applications filed. The process uses low-temperature  electrolysis, which can be powered using renewable  electricity and offers a potential pathway to enable the full  spectrum of Fortescue’s iron ore products to be converted  into green iron. Green technology Leveraging Fortescue’s long history of adopting leading  edge technology, we are setting the pace for innovation  in the green energy space. We have a growing portfolio of  technology assets which will support the decarbonisation  efforts of our operations and create new revenue streams for  our business. Construction works were completed at our electrolyser  manufacturing facility, the Green Energy Manufacturing  Centre, in Gladstone, Queensland. Further fit-out of the  facility, including the automated production line and testing  facilities, has now commenced. This facility has an initial  output capacity of 2GW. We completed the R&D Perth Technology Innovation Centre  and opened its Colorado Technology Innovation Centre in  the USA, which will tap into the US talent pool and innovation  ecosystem.   Together with Siemens Energy, we announced the  commencement of work on a new ammonia cracker  prototype. Using our Metal Membrane Technology,  developed in partnership with the CSIRO, the cracker is part  of the green hydrogen supply chain.  ===== PAGE 38 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    36 Operating and financial review FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE During the year ended 30 June 2023, Fortescue delivered an underlying  net profit after tax of US$5,522 million and underlying earnings per share  of 180 US cents Key metrics 2023 2022 Revenue, US$ millions 16,871 17,390 Underlying EBITDA¹, US$ millions 9,963 10,561 Net profit after tax, US$ millions 4,796 6,197 Earnings per share, US cents 156 201 Earnings per share, AUD cents 231 277 Impairment expense after tax, US$ millions 726 – Underlying net profit after tax, US$ millions² 5,522 6,197 Underlying earnings per share, US cents 180 201 Underlying earnings per share, AUD cents 267 277 Average realised price, US$/dmt³ 95 100 C1 costs, US$/wmt 17.54 15.91 Underlying EBITDA margin, US$/dmt (excl Fortescue Energy) 60 63 Key ratios Underlying EBITDA margin, % 59 61 Return on equity, on underlying earnings, % 31 35 1   Refer to page 40 for the reconciliation of underlying EBITDA to the financial metrics reported in the financial statements under   Australian Accounting Standards.  2   The term ‘Underlying NPAT’ refers to results adjusted for the removal of significant non-cash and non-recurring items. Fortescue has one   expense in this category being the US$726 million post tax impairment expense on the Iron Bridge Cash Generating Unit. 3   Dry metric tonnes FINANCIAL   RESULTS Financial performance reflects record shipments of  192.0mt combined with strong price realisation through  the market cycle. Fortescue’s approach to an integrated  operations and marketing strategy combined with  strong cost management to maximise margins has  substantially mitigated inflationary pressures in labour,  materials and energy markets which remain a key  exposure risk. The strength of operating performance  and a continued focus on productivity and efficiency has  supported the underlying EBITDA margin strength.

C1 costs averaged US$17.54/wmt for the year, 10 per cent higher compared to the prior period. The increase in C1 costs   reflects market inflationary pressures, including: •	 Labour cost pressures reflecting significant demand for skilled labour across the resources industry.  •	 Increase in underlying base price of maintenance materials reflecting global supply chain constraints as production  attempts to return to post COVID-19 levels. •	 Increase in energy and fuels costs.  Other factors influencing C1 cost performance were movements in exchange rates, with the AUD to USD averaging 0.67 in  FY23 compared to 0.73 in FY22 as well as the strip ratio increasing to 1.5x in FY23 from 1.4x FY22.  Total delivered costs were further impacted by a 33 per cent decrease in the shipping index between FY22 and FY23. Fortescue has actively managed cost increases through the cycle while also utilising the capacity in the value chain to  generate record shipments. Fortescue focuses on maximising margins and underlying EBITDA throughout the market cycle  through our operating and marketing strategy. Cost management continues to be a focus, but inflationary pressures remain a  risk.  ===== PAGE 42 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    40 Operating and financial review Financial performance UNDERLYING EBITDA Underlying EBITDA, defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, exploration, development   and other expenses, and impairment expense, is used as a key measure of the Company’s financial performance. During   FY23, Fortescue’s operations generated underlying EBITDA of US$9,963 million (FY22: US$10,561 million). The reconciliation  of Underlying EBITDA to the financial metrics reported in the financial statements under Australian Accounting Standards is   presented below. Note1 2023 US$m 2022 US$m Operating sales revenue 3 16,871 17,390 Cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortisation 5 (6,109) (6,175) Net foreign exchange gain/(loss) 4,6 48 (103) Administration expenses 6 (288) (204) Research expenditure 6 (553) (354) Other income 4,6 2 1 Share of (loss)/profit from equity accounted investments 23 (c) (8) 6 Underlying EBITDA 9,963 10,561 Finance income 7 149 14 Finance expenses 7 (275) (174) Depreciation and amortisation 5,6 (1,744) (1,528) Exploration, development and other expenses 6 (170) (27) Impairment expense 6 (1,037) – Income tax expense 14 (a) (2,090) (2,649) Net profit after tax 4,796 6,197 Underlying net profit after tax 5,522 6,197 1 Notes to the accompanying financial statements. The key factors contributing to the six per cent decrease in underlying EBITDA from the prior period were:  •	 Five per cent reduction in realised iron ore price to US$95/dmt (FY22: US$100/dmt) reflecting reduction in the iron ore  index. •	 Two per cent increase in sales volumes to 192mt in FY23 from 189mt in FY22. •	 Ten per cent increase in C1 cost to US$17.54/wmt in FY23 from US$15.91/wmt in FY22. •	 Decrease in shipping costs to US$1,455 million in FY23 from US$1,976 million in FY22, reflecting movements in the shipping  index. •	 US$199 million increase in research expenses, predominantly related to Fortescue Energy activities. The underlying EBITDA of US$9,963 million for FY23 represents a margin of 59 per cent (63 per cent or US$60/dmt excluding  Fortescue Energy). As illustrated in the chart below, Metals has been maintaining strong underlying EBITDA margins through  market cycles, demonstrating the commitment to and focus on productivity, efficiency and innovation.   ===== PAGE 43 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    41 Corporate governance Operating and   financial review Corporate directory Our approach to   sustainability Our approach to   climate change Directors' report    |  Remuneration Report  Financial report Overview Ore Reserves and  Mineral Resources Underlying EBITDA, US$/dmt Average Fortescue realised price, US$/dmt Fortescue realised price, US$/dmt Average underlying EBITDA, US$/dmt 62% Platts CFR Index, US$/dmt US$/dmt 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 21 FY23 30 20 39 99 63 60 FY21 FY20 FY19 FY18 FY17 FY16 52 FY22 Financial performance UNDERLYING EBITDA (CONTINUED) Underlying EBITDA excluding Fortescue Energy Other income/Other expenses Other income (US$50 million) predominantly reflects the  favourable foreign currency exchange movements. Other expenses reflect the movement in equity accounted  investments, and the write-off of exploration and  development expenditure. Impairment expense At 30 June 2023, an impairment expense of US$1,037 million  was recognised for the Iron Bridge Cash Generating Unit  (CGU) (post tax US$726 million). The impairment expense  reflects inflationary cost pressures, increase in discount  rates and timing of project ramp-up. Key details of the  Iron Bridge impairment is within note 12(a) of the financial  statements. Depreciation, interest and tax Key non-operating matters forming part of the financial  result include: •	 Depreciation and amortisation of US$1,744 million is up   14 per cent on the prior period (FY22: US$1,528 million) as  a result of the commissioning of assets and an increase in  production compared to FY22.  •	 Net finance expenses of $126 million for FY23 (US$160  million in FY22), reflecting interest income of US$149  million. •	 Income tax expense for FY23 of US$2,090 million  represents an effective tax rate of 30.4 per cent   (FY22: US$2,649 million, effective tax rate of 30 per cent).  Income tax expense has decreased in line with underlying  financial performance and reflects the Iron Bridge  impairment.   ===== PAGE 44 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    42 Operating and financial review DEBT AND LIQUIDITY Debt Fortescue’s balance sheet includes low-cost debt which is at investment-grade terms.

Operating property Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources  have all been reported and classified in accordance with the  guidelines of the 2012 edition of the Australasian Code for  Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and  Ore Reserves (the JORC Code). Accordingly, the information  in these sections should be read in conjunction with the  respective explanatory Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve  information (Fortescue ASX release dated 26 August 2022). Development property Mineral Resources have been  reported and classified in accordance with the JORC Code.  The development property Mineral Resources are detailed  in Fortescue ASX releases dated 26 August 2022, 27 August  2021, 21 August 2020, 23 August 2019, 17 August 2018,   18 August 2017, 8 January 2015 and 20 May 2014, which  include supporting technical data. Magnetite Mineral Resources have been reported and  classified in accordance with the JORC Code. The Mineral  Resources quoted in this report should be read in conjunction  with the supporting technical information contained in the  corresponding ASX release dated 26 August 2022. The Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimation processes  followed internally are well established and are subject to  systematic internal peer review, including calibration against  operational outcomes. Independent technical reviews and  audits are undertaken on an as-required basis as part of  Fortescue’s risk management process. In addition to routine internal audits and peer review,  auditing of the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates  is addressed as a sub-set of the annual internal audit plan  approved by the Board Audit and Risk Management and  Sustainability Committee (ARMSC). Specific auditing of the  Ore Reserve process was performed in 2011, 2013, 2015,  2016, 2017, 2019, 2021, 2022 and 2023. These audits were  managed by Fortescue’s internal audit service provider with  external technical subject experts. The 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019,  2021, 2022 and 2023 Ore Reserves audits were carried out  by independent external technical consultants. In addition,  specific auditing of Mineral Resource models was undertaken  in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2022 and 2023.   The ARMSC also monitors the Ore Reserve and Mineral  Resource status and recommends it to the Board for approval.  The annual Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource updates are  a prescribed activity within the annual Corporate Planning  Calendar that includes a schedule of regular Executive  engagement meetings to approve assumptions and guide the  overall process. Tonnage and quality information contained in the following  tables have been rounded and as a result the figures may not  add up to the totals quoted. Ore Reserves Operating Properties –  Hematite The combined Chichester, Solomon, and Western Hub  Hematite Ore Reserves for 2023 are estimated to total  1,866mt at an average Fe grade of 57.4%. The Ore Reserve is quoted as of 30 June 2023 and is  inclusive of ore and product stockpiles at mines. Product  stockpiles at port have been excluded from contributing to  Ore Reserves. The proportion of higher confidence Proved  Ore Reserve has decreased slightly to 994mt (from 1,018mt  in 2022) after accounting for the production depletion and  ongoing in-fill drilling. The Chichester Hub (Cloudbreak and Christmas Creek  deposits) contains 985mt at an average Fe grade of 57.2%, a  net decrease of 93mt primarily due to depletion. Proved Ore  Reserve constitutes 57.6% of the Chichester Ore Reserve,  an increase of 1.4% as compared to 2022 Ore Reserves as  reported in 2022. While the Cloudbreak and Christmas  Creek deposits are quoted separately for historical reasons,  they effectively represent a single deposit with ore generally  directed to the most proximal of the three available ore  processing facilities (OPFs). The Ore Reserve estimate for the Solomon Hub is 668mt at  an average Fe grade of 56.9%, a minor decrease of 14mt after  accounting for depletion and increase in mineral resource  tonnes, along with pit design modifications. Proved Ore  Reserves comprise 37% of the tonnage in the total Solomon  Reserve, an increase of about 6% as compared to 2022 Ore  Reserves. The Ore Reserve for the Western Hub (Eliwana and Flying  Fish) deposit is estimated to be 213mt at an average Fe  grade of 59.4%. The contribution (tonnes and grades) of the  Western Hub alone has reduced, resulting in a net decrease  of 14mt reflecting depletion, exclusion of areas as a result  of heritage management. Proved Ore Reserves comprise  83% of the tonnage in the total Western Hub Ore Reserve,  which is a minor decrease of 2% as compared to 2022 Ore  Reserves.  The 2023 Hematite Ore Reserve estimates were subject to  comprehensive review and update addressing: •	 Ore depletion as a result of sales (decrease). •	 Exclusions of sites of heritage significance, permanent  infrastructures (OPF, tailings storage facility etc) and  tenement boundaries.  •	 Revision of ore loss and dilution factors based on 12  months of operational history at all mines.  •	 Revision to the processing response through all OPFs  based on updated metallurgical test work and operational  history.  •	 Re-optimisation of mine geometries to maximise the  benefit of changes to the resource base resulted in  improvement to the economic viability of extracting ore. •	 A revised Life of Mine (LOM) plan that addresses the listed  items and incorporates the latest information on long  term product strategy, including the Western Pilbara Fines  60.3% Fe product and Fortescue Lump.  ===== PAGE 51 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    49 Corporate governance Operating and   financial review Corporate directory Our approach to   sustainability Our approach to   climate change Directors' report    |  Remuneration Report  Financial report Overview Ore Reserves and  Mineral Resources Ore Reserves Operating Properties – Hematite  30 JUNE 2023 30 JUNE 2022    Product  tonnes  (mt) Iron  Fe   % Silica  SiO₂   % Alumina  Al2O3   % Phos  P   % LOI   % Product   tonnes  (mt) Iron  Fe   % Silica  SiO2   % Alumina  Al2O3   % Phos  P   % LOI   % Cloudbreak Proved 270 57.6 5.12 2.82 0.056 8.1 291 57.6 5.15 2.69 0.055 7.8 Probable 91 56.6 5.57 3.12 0.056 8.4 99 56.7 5.66 2.88 0.061 8.0 Total 361 57.3 5.23 2.89 0.056 8.2 389 57.3 5.28 2.74 0.057 7.9 Christmas Creek Proved 297 57.2 5.96 2.63 0.052 7.9 316 57.0 6.27 2.89 0.046 7.9 Probable  327 57.2 6.05 2.91 0.054 7.7 373 57.2 6.08 3.08 0.050 7.6 Total 624 57.2 6.01 2.78 0.053 7.8 688 57.1 6.17 2.99 0.048 7.7 Sub-total Chichester Hub Proved 568 57.4 5.55 2.72 0.054 8.0 606 57.3 5.74 2.80 0.050 7.9 Probable 418 57.0 5.95 2.96 0.055 7.9 471 57.1 6.00 3.04 0.052 7.7 Total 985 57.2 5.72 2.82 0.054 7.9 1,078 57.2 5.85 2.90 0.051 7.8 Firetail Proved 16  59.3 5.61 2.20 0.127 6.9 2 58.9 6.51 2.70 0.133 5.5 Probable 35  58.5 6.37 2.60 0.116  7.1 62 58.8 5.90 2.44 0.117 6.7 Total 51  58.7 6.13 2.47 0.119 7.0 64 58.9 5.92 2.44 0.117 6.6 Kings and Queens Proved 233 56.7 6.80 2.95 0.080 8.9 215 56.4 6.63 2.69 0.078 9.5 Probable 383 56.8 6.90 2.91 0.082 8.8 402 56.8 6.52 2.86 0.080 8.8 Total 616 56.7 6.86 2.93 0.081 8.8 618 56.7 6.56 2.80 0.079 9.0 Sub-total Solomon Hub Proved 249 56.8 6.74 2.91 0.082 8.8 218 56.5 6.63 2.69 0.078 9.4 Probable 419 56.9 6.86 2.89 0.084 8.6 464 57 6.44 2.81 0.085 8.5 Total 668 56.9 6.81 2.89 0.084 8.7 682 56.9 6.50 2.77 0.083 8.8 Western Hub Proved 177 59.4 5.01 2.72 0.115 6.6 194 60.1 4.63 2.58 0.125 6.1 Probable 36 59.3 4.71 2.62 0.069 6.9 33 60.2 4.21 2.40 0.080 6.5 Total 213 59.4 4.96 2.70 0.107 6.6 227 60.1 4.57 2.56 0.118 6.1 Total Ore Reserves Operating Properties – Hematite Proved 994 57.6 5.74 2.77 0.072 7.9 1,018 57.6 5.71 2.73 0.071 7.9 Probable 872 57.1 6.33 2.91 0.070  8.2 969 57.2 6.15 2.91 0.069 8.0 Total 1,866 57.4 6.02 2.83 0.071  8.1 1,986 57.4 5.92 2.82 0.070 7.9 Notes in reference to table •	 The diluted mining models used to report the 2023 Ore Reserves are based on regional Mineral Resource models completed in 2016 for Christmas Creek,  2016 for Cloudbreak, 2021 for Firetail, 2019 for Queens, 2017 for Kings, 2019 for Kutayi and 2019 for Eliwana.

Ore Reserves for the project total 843mt at an average mass  recovery of 29.9% for a 67.3% Fe grade product. The Ore  Reserves are quoted as at 30 June 2023, on a dry in-situ  tonnes basis prior to processing. The Mineral Resource model for Iron Bridge was developed  by Snowden Mining Industry Consultants in conjunction with  Fortescue’s internal technical team during February and  March 2022. The Ore Reserves estimate was developed in May and June  2023 by the Iron Bridge technical team on the basis of the  2022 resource model using detailed information on mining,  geotechnical and metallurgical processing parameters  and latest cost assumptions, aligned with the proposed  operations strategy. Within North Star mining pits, mining within 100m of the  Pilbara Leaf Nosed Bat (PLNB) cave identified as Cave 13  is prohibited by the current Stage 2 Ministerial Approval  (Condition 10) until such time it can be demonstrated that  ground disturbing activity in the area maintains the viability  of population of PLNB. Primary environmental approvals for  the Glacier Valley are in progress and currently with state  and commonwealth regulators. At this stage, neither of the  above is expected to have a material impact on Ore Reserves  as plans have been developed and action underway to  address each of the points. As part of the mine scheduling  process, appropriate access delays have been applied to  ore inventory in North Star mining pit within 100m of PLNB  cave and Glacier Valley mining area to model the timeframe  required for approvals. The Ore Reserves have been estimated from Measured and  Indicated Mineral Resources from within the North Star,  Eastern Limb and Glacier Valley mining areas. All Magnetite  Ore Reserves are classified as Probable Reserves due to  the lack of full-scale production history, as no sales have  occurred for magnetite as at 30 June 2023 and adjusted for  any depletion in the prior 12-month period.

A group of heritage  sites in the southern portion of the Glacier Valley area have  been excluded from the Mineral Resource using engineered  shapes to account for the pit slope. The Mineral Resource for the South Star deposit was  updated to incorporate additional drilling that was  conducted in 2023. The South Star deposit is located  along strike and to the south of Glacier Valley across  two tenements, E45/4025 and E45/3084. One of these  tenements, E45/4025, is held by Fortescue through its  wholly owned subsidiary FMG Pilbara Pty Ltd. The drilling  program undertaken during 2023 across E45/3084 and  E45/4025 tenements, has increased the South Star Mineral  Resource to 1,204mt (from 898mt in 2022) at 22.4% mass  recovery, reported above a 9% mass recovery cut-off. All magnetite Mineral Resources are reported within a  high revenue factor pit shell (US$200/t) to constrain the  reportable resource to mineralisation that has reasonable  prospects for economic extraction by open-pit mining and  has been adjusted for depletion of mined tonnes. As of 30 June 2023, the total magnetite Mineral Resource  is estimated to be 6,475mt (from 6,184mt in 2022) at an  average mass recovery of 22.7%, reported above a 9% mass  recovery cut-off.  ===== PAGE 57 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    55 Corporate governance Operating and   financial review Corporate directory Our approach to   sustainability Our approach to   climate change Directors' report    |  Remuneration Report  Financial report Overview Ore Reserves and  Mineral Resources Mineral Resources Operating Properties – Magnetite  30 JUNE 2023 30 JUNE 2022    In-situ   tonnes  (mt) FMG   proportion % FMG attributable   tonnes (mt) DTR mass   recovery  % In-situ    Iron Fe   % In-situ Silica   SiO2  % In-situ Alumina  Al2O3  % In-situ   tonnes  (mt) FMG   proportion % FMG attributable   tonnes (mt) DTR mass   recovery  % In-situ Iron   Fe   % In-situ Silica   SiO2  % In-situ Alumina  Al2O3  %  North Star and Eastern Limb (M45/1226) Measured 256 69 177 25.7 31.2 41.4 2.9 260 69 179 25.2 31.3 41.4 2.9 Indicated 780 69 538 24.6 30.2 41.3 2.7 764 69 527 24.6 30.2 41.3 2.7 Inferred 2,274 69 1,569 23.8 29.8 41.7 2.9 2,300 69 1,587 23.8 29.8 41.7 2.9 Total 3,310 69 2,284 24.2 30.0 41.6 2.8 3,324 69 2,294 24.1 30.0 41.6 2.8 Glacier Valley (M45/1244 & M45/1226) Measured 54 69 38 25.4 35.1 39.2 1.6 54 69 37 25.4 35.0 39.3 1.6 Indicated 284 69 196 23.7 33.1 39.1 1.7 272 69 188 23.7 33.1 39.2 1.7 Inferred 1,020 69 704 19.4 31.5 40.0 2.2 1,033 69 712 19.4 31.5 40.0 2.2 Total 1,359 69 938 20.5 32.0 39.8 2.0 1,359 69 938 20.5 32.0 39.8 2.0 West Star (M45/1226) Measured - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Indicated - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Inferred 602 69 416 20.3 28.0 43.9 3.4 602 69 416 20.3 28.0 43.9 3.4 Total 602 69 416 20.3 28.0 43.9 3.4 602 69 416 20.3 28.0 43.9 3.4 South Star (E45/3084) Measured - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Indicated - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Inferred 398 69 275 24.3 31.4 41.4 0.7 302 69 208 25.9 32.3 40.9 0.6 Total 398 69 275 24.3 31.4 41.4 0.7 302 69 208 25.9 32.3 40.9 0.6 South Star (E45/4025) Measured - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Indicated - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Inferred 806 100 806 21.5 32.0 40.4 0.9 596 100 596 20.7 32.2 40.3 1.1 Total 806 100 806 21.5 32.0 40.4 0.9 596 100 596 20.7 32.2 40.3 1.1 Total Mineral Resources Operating Properties – Magnetite Measured 311 - 215 25.6 31.9 41.0 2.6 314 - 217 25.3 31.9 41.0 2.6 Indicated 1,064 - 734 24.4 31.0 40.8 2.4 1,037 - 715 24.4 31.0 40.8 2.4 Inferred 5,100 - 3,769 22.2 30.4 41.4 2.3 4,833 - 3,519 22.2 30.4 41.4 2.4 Total 6,475 - 4,718 22.7 30.6 41.3 2.3 6,184 - 4,451 22.7 30.6 41.3 2.4 Notes in reference to table •	 Magnetite Mineral Resources are reported above a 9% mass recovery cut-off, based on Davis Tube Recovery (DTR) test work. •	 Oxide mineralisation above 9% mass recovery comprises approximately 7% of the total Mineral Resource tonnage. •	 Magnetite Mineral Resources are reported within a high revenue factor pit shell (US$200/t) to constrain the resource to mineralisation that has  reasonable prospects for economic extraction by open-pit mining. •	 Mineral Resources are reported on a dry, in situ tonnage basis. •	 Mineral Resources are reported inclusive of Ore Reserves. •	 Figures have been rounded and as a result may not add up to the totals quoted.  ===== PAGE 58 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    56 Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources Competent Persons Statement The detail in this report that relates to Hematite Mineral  Resources is based on information compiled by Mr Stuart  Robinson, Mr Nicholas Nitschke, Ms Erin Retz, Mr Stuart  Badock, Ms Suzanne Caron and Mr John Graindorge,  full-time employees and shareholders of Fortescue.

We are focused on achieving leading practice and ensuring  that communities continue to benefit from our growth  and development as we take a global leadership role in  addressing climate change and supporting the transition to  green energy on a global scale.  Our sustainability commitments are developed in  collaboration with our stakeholders and aim to create  value for our investors, ensure the health and safety of our  employees, protect the environment and empower the  communities in which we operate.  Sustainability is integrated into our decision-making and  strategic and risk management processes. Compliance  with all relevant legislation and obligations, including those  that govern health, safety and environment, is the absolute  minimum standard to which we operate.  Our unique culture and Values form the base of our  sustainability framework, which incorporates specific  polices, objectives and targets. Sustainability governance Good governance is critical to strong sustainability  performance, and our Board is responsible for the  oversight of all sustainability matters, receiving regular  updates through the Audit, Risk Management and  Sustainability Committee (ARMSC). Key outcomes for  ARMSC in FY23 include: •	 endorsement of the revised Environment Policy •	 endorsement of the FPIC Position Statement •	 endorsement of the revised Human Rights Policy. Operationally, sustainability is managed by our Chief  Executive Officers with support from our executive  Sustainability Committee that meets at least quarterly  to oversee all sustainability matters. In FY23, this  Committee approved site specific water targets for  two operating mine hubs at Eliwana and Solomon. Our  Sustainability team coordinates the implementation of  our sustainability strategy, related policies and targets  across the business.  The Sustainability Committee works to ensure  continuous improvement and that the sustainability  strategy, related policies and targets are embedded  throughout our business. Our sustainability strategy  outlines commitments and targets and provides  implementation guidance. The early identification and  assessment of sustainability matters alerts Fortescue  to potential risks and opportunities and enables the  planning of mitigation and optimisation strategies.   These assessments may result in amendments to a  project or avoidance if the risk of proceeding is found to  be too high. Sustainability is critical to the  future success of our Company  and we integrate it into all aspects  of our business Our Purpose   and Values Code of Conduct  and Integrity Targets Opportunities  and objectives Policies  Voluntary   commitments   and principles  ===== PAGE 61 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    59 Corporate governance Operating and   financial review Corporate directory Our approach to   sustainability Our approach to   climate change Directors' report    |  Remuneration Report  Financial report Overview Ore Reserves and  Mineral Resources Risk-based approach to sustainability Sustainability risks are considered within our material risk  exposures, as reported in the FY23 Corporate Governance  Statement, as well as within functional risk assessment  processes by business area, project and facility. The Fortescue Risk Management Framework consists  of a Risk Management Policy and a Risk Management  Standard. In FY23, we revised our risk matrix, where we  define likelihood and consequence criteria to ensure risks  are considered consistently across the Company. The risk  matrix includes criteria aligned with a number of our material  topics, including: •	 economic contribution (addressed under financial impact  criteria) Materiality Material topics are those that may have a significant impact  on our ability to achieve our commitments and targets.  These topics are identified through an annual assessment  process that considers risks and opportunities, external  stakeholder views, our internal subject matter expertise and  third-party due diligence. The assessment involves a cycle of  research, identification, prioritisation, validation and review. During FY23, our materiality assessment considered the  following:  •	 sustainability initiatives and targets  •	 corporate risk assessments and audits  •	 policies, standards and guidelines  •	 results of internal and external stakeholder engagement  •	 media and investor interest and feedback  •	 material topics identified by peers, sustainability leaders  and materiality analysis  •	 benchmarking and environmental, social and   governance assessments.  Priorities were informed by internal and external  stakeholder engagement. Materiality was  validated by subject leaders and the  Sustainability Committee, with 12 topics  determined to be material within three  sustainable development pillars: People,  Planet and Process. We have aligned  our approach to sustainability with  the United Nations Sustainable  Development Goals (SDGs) and  will continue to work with our host  governments as they strive to meet  these goals. •	 employee safety and wellbeing (addressed under health  and safety)  •	 climate action, protecting biodiversity and protecting  water resources (addressed under environment criteria) •	 respecting human rights, respecting heritage and culture  and building thriving communities (addressed under  social/community/heritage criteria) •	 business integrity (addressed under reputation and brand,  as well as legal and compliance criteria). Ensuring sustainability risks are adequately considered  in our functional risk assessments is an area of focus for  Fortescue. In FY24, we will commence a double materiality assessment  in accordance with the requirements of the GRI standards.  The double materiality process requires a company to judge  materiality from two perspectives:  1)	“the extent necessary for an understanding of the  company’s development, performance and position” and  “in the broad sense of affecting the value of the company” 2) environmental and social impact of the company’s  activities on a broad range of stakeholders. It is expected that this process will continue to evolve our  material topics, ensuring that our focus remains on the  topics which are most relevant to our business, society and  the environment.  ===== PAGE 62 ===== MEASURING OUR PERFORMANCE    PEOPLE Employee safety and wellbeing OBJECTIVE: To be global  leaders in safety OBJECTIVE: To be global  leaders in safety OBJECTIVE: To be global  leaders in safety OBJECTIVE: To be global  leaders in safety TARGET: Achieve zero fatalities TARGET: Reduce our injury risk  profile by 15 per cent TARGET: Maintain TRIFR   below the global resources  industry lowest quartile TARGET: TRIFR not   exceeding 4.0 Fatalities Injury risk profile reduction  (Fortescue Metals) TRIFR   (Fortescue Metals) TRIFR (FFI) FY23    0 FY23   22%   FY23   1.8   FY23   0.0 FY22    1 FY22   21%   FY22    1.8   FY22   0.7 FY21    0    FY21    2.0   Female employment and development OBJECTIVE: Increase the number of  female employees to be reflective of  general society OBJECTIVE: Increase gender diversity  in FFI OBJECTIVE: Provide opportunities  for female employees to move into  leadership positions TARGET: Year on year increase in female  employment TARGET: Increase female employment in FFI  >38 per cent TARGET: Year on year increase in  female employment in leadership roles Female employment Female employment in FFI Females in leadership roles   (Manager and above) FY23   23%   FY23   34%   FY23   26%   FY22   23% FY22  34% FY22    24%  FY21   21%    FY21    25%   First Nations Australians employment and development OBJECTIVE: Increase the number of  First Nations Australian employees to  be reflective of general society OBJECTIVE: Increase the number of  First Nations Australian employees to be  reflective of general society OBJECTIVE: Provide opportunities  for First Nations Australian people to  move into leadership positions TARGET: Year on year increase in our   First Nations Australian employment rate TARGET: Year on year increase in the   First Nations Australian employment rate in  Pilbara operations TARGET: Year on year increase in the  First Nations Australian employment  rate in leadership roles First Nations Australian  employment in Australian  workforce First Nations Australian  employment in Pilbara operations  First Nations Australian  leadership roles FY23   10%  FY23   16%   FY23   4%   FY22   10% FY22   15% FY22    4%   FY21   10% FY21   14% FY21    4%   Respecting heritage and culture OBJECTIVE: Work together with Indigenous people to  manage First Nations heritage responsibly and sustainably TARGET: Annually, ensure no impact to First Nations heritage  without consultation with and consent from First Nations people  Significant heritage incidents  FY23   0 FY22  0 FY21  1   Building thriving communities OBJECTIVE: Create economic opportunities for First  Nations businesses through local procurement, business  development, mentoring and capacity-building opportunities Target: Annually, achieve a spend of 10 per cent with First Nations  businesses Spend with Aboriginal businesses   FY23  5% FY22  5%   FY21  5%    ===== PAGE 63 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    61 Corporate governance Operating and   financial review Corporate directory Our approach to   sustainability Our approach to   climate change Directors' report    |  Remuneration Report  Financial report Overview Ore Reserves and  Mineral Resources    PLANET Protecting biodiversity Building circularity OBJECTIVE: Use water  responsibly by improving  water use efficiency and  minimising water loss  through surface water  discharge and evaporation OBJECTIVE: Use water  responsibly by improving  water use efficiency and  minimising water loss  through surface water  discharge and evaporation TARGET: Set public, site- specific water management  targets for each of our  operating mines by FY23 TARGET: Annually, ensure  at least 80 per cent of water  abstracted at the Cloudbreak  and Christmas Creek mine  sites is used for operational  requirements or beneficial  environmental purposes  Operating mine sites  with site-specific targets Progress •  FY23: Eliwana and Solomon mine  sites targets set •  FY19: Chichester Hub (Christmas  Creek and Cloudbreak mines)  targets set FY23   96% FY22   99% FY21   98% OBJECTIVE: Use water  responsibly by improving  water use efficiency and  minimising water loss  through surface water  discharge and evaporation OBJECTIVE: Use water  responsibly by improving water  use efficiency and minimising  water loss through surface water  discharge and evaporation TARGET: Pilot the Minerals  Council of Australia Water  Accounting Framework at  Eliwana, in line with the ICMM  Water Stewardship Framework,  in FY24, to provide a catchment- wide view of water flows, uses  and quality.

The remainder of this report will outline how we plan to reduce our emissions Fortescue emits more than 2.5 million tonnes of carbon  dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) into the atmosphere every year.  Customers of our iron ore – primarily steel mills located in  Asia – emit a further 261.5 million tonnes of CO2-eq annually.  This report outlines our Board approved US$6.2 billion plan  to achieve Real Zero profitably, which means the elimination  of Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 by eliminating the use of  fossil fuels from our Australian terrestrial iron ore operations.  We are dedicated to doing this without using voluntary  carbon offsets from FY24 onwards for Scope 1 and 2  emissions. At the time of this report, Fortescue has identified  the solutions it plans to adopt to eliminate approximately  90% of terrestrial Scope 1 and 2 emissions from its  Australian iron ore operations. We are actively working to  identify solutions for the final approximately 10%.  We also have separate targets to eliminate emissions from  our marine vessels by 2030 and achieve Net Zero Scope 3  emissions by 2040. We are presently developing our plans to  meet these targets. Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from sources owned  or controlled by an entity. Scope 2 refers to emissions  associated with the production of electricity, heat, or steam  purchased by an entity. Scope 3 refers to all other indirect  emissions associated with activities or facilities not owned or  controlled by the entity. 1,2 In general, when we refer to emissions, we refer to all  greenhouse emissions, reported in the unit of tonnes of   CO2-eq. This is defined as the amount of CO2 that would  cause the same temperature rise, over a given time period,  as an emitted amount of greenhouse gas or mixture of  greenhouse gases.³ Stepping beyond fossil fuels and voluntary carbon offsets  helps reduce our exposure to regulatory, reputational and  supply chain risk, while potentially generating significant  operating cost savings. In FY23, gas and diesel cost Fortescue over US$560 million,  while voluntary offsets cost US$6.2 million. Eliminating our emissions could also bring greater value to  our shareholders, enabling us to enter the growing market  for zero-emissions power systems, commercialise our green  technologies and enable access to sustainable finances. Scope 1 and 2 emissions  In FY23, total gross Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our  Australian iron ore operations and Fortescue marine vessels,  which consist of eight ore carriers and nine tugboats that  operate under Fortescue’s operational control in Port  Hedland, were 2.55 million tonnes CO2-eq.  Our Scope 1 emissions consisted of 2.2 million tonnes of  CO2-eq in FY23, while our Scope 2 emissions from power  purchases were lower, at 0.35 million tonnes of CO2-eq.    Of our FY23 Scope 1 mining operations emissions: •	 35% came from other Heavy Mobile Equipment (HME; 	 	 diesel) •	 25% originated from our mining haul trucks (diesel) •	 13% came from stationary power (gas, diesel) •	 12% originated from marine vessels under our exclusive 	 	 control (heavy marine fuel oil) •	 11% came from our rail operations (diesel) •	 4% came from other sources 1 https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/ green driven capital markets.uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_annex-i.pdf 2 Under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Accounting standards, we use the 'Operational Control' boundary method.  3 https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/glossary/#:~:text=CO2%20equivalent%20(CO2,or%20a%20mixture%20of%20GHGs.  ===== PAGE 69 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    67 Corporate governance Operating and   financial review Corporate directory Our approach to   sustainability Our approach to   climate change Directors' report    |  Remuneration Report  Financial report Overview Ore Reserves and  Mineral Resources FY23 Scope 1 iron ore emissions Scope 1 Stationary  power - gas 10% Stationary  power - diesel 3% Haul trucks  25% Rail -  locomotives 11% Other 4% Shipping 12% Other Heavy  Mining  Equipment 35% In working towards eliminating our emissions, we are  developing and evaluating the following solutions: •	 Stationary power: wind and solar, grid scale batteries,  demand response and reserve power provided by a green  fuel such as green ammonia •	 Ore carriers: green ammonia or green methanol  •	 Tugs: battery-hybrid vessels using green ammonia and/or  green hydrogen  •	 Rail: battery electric, including our Infinity Train solution  and/or green ammonia •	 Haul trucks and other Heavy Mobile Equipment: powered  by batteries, trailing cables from the power grid or green  hydrogen fuel cells. As part of our plan to achieve Real Zero terrestrial emissions  across our Australian iron ore operations by 2030, we  forecast that our Scope 1 and 2 emissions in the Pilbara will  initially rise out to FY26 before they begin to fall. This initial  rise will occur due to production at Iron Bridge scaling up to  hit nameplate capacity.  Fortescue’s use of renewable energy in the Pilbara continues to rise: •	 Since FY19, renewable energy use has risen from less than 1 gigawatt hour (GWh) to 145.7 GWh in FY23 •	 Since FY22, renewable energy consumption has risen 58 GWh  •	 Today, renewable energy comprises 20% of the electricity we purchase for our Pilbara iron ore operations In FY23 we also surrendered 336,833 tonnes in CO2-eq of offsets to meet our previous commitment to a 3% year-on- year net reduction in our emissions. As stated earlier, in FY24 we will no longer purchase voluntary carbon offsets for  Scope 1 and 2 emissions, instead focusing our efforts on actual emission elimination. We will replace our 3% target by  committing interim financial spend to deliver our decarbonisation pathway to Real Zero. Emissions are forecast to fall from FY26 onwards as renewable power capacity substantially increases and we begin to  deploy a zero-emission mobile fleet across our Pilbara operations. At the time of this report, Fortescue has identified the solutions it plans to adopt to eliminate approximately 90% of  terrestrial Scope 1 and 2 emissions from its Australian iron ore operations. We are actively working to identify solutions for  the final approximately 10%. *Our emissions are forecast to fall within the shaded range based on our current decarbonisation plan and modelling. It is subject to  various factors beyond our control, including those set out in this report and our FY23 Annual Report.

This increase in Scope  3 emissions was caused primarily by a rise in the amount of  iron ore shipped, from 189 million tonnes in FY22 to   192 million tonnes in FY23.  Scope 3 emissions are those that fall within our value chain  but are outside our operational control, including those  generated during the shipping of our products in non- Fortescue vessels and iron and steel production.⁴ By far the largest source of Fortescue’s Scope 3 emissions  is the steelmaking process, which accounts for 98% of  our Scope 3 emissions or 261.5 million tonnes CO2-eq.  Steelmaking generates significant emissions due to its  current reliance on coking and thermal coal, however  new approaches that use renewable electricity and green  hydrogen to produce green steel are under development by  Fortescue and other businesses.  4  Our Scope 3 estimates are informed by the international GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. In  accordance with this guidance, estimates for quantified Scope 3 emissions that were determined to be material are provided in the data tables.  The next largest sources of Scope 3 emissions in FY23 were  chartered cargo shipping (2.78 million tonnes CO2-eq) and  purchased goods and services (2.5 million tonnes CO2-eq). Key drivers for the change in Scope 3 emissions between  FY23 and FY22 were: •	 Changes in estimation methodologies for purchased  goods and services, capital goods, and shipping (see  Section 13 for detail) •	 Greater production of iron ore •	 Changes in our product mix and destination markets Scope 3 emissions   excluding crude steel manufacturing 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Chartered cargo ship Purchased goods and services Capital goods Fuel and energy refining and transport Employee commuting Business travel  ===== PAGE 71 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    69 Corporate governance Operating and   financial review Corporate directory Our approach to   sustainability Our approach to   climate change Directors' report    |  Remuneration Report  Financial report Overview Ore Reserves and  Mineral Resources GHG EMISSIONS DATA FY23 FY22  FY21  FY20  Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (million tonnes CO₂-e) Total Gross Scope 1 and 2 emissions 2.55 2.55 2.56 2.43 Total Gross Scope 1 emissions 2.2 2.21 2.40 2.27      Gross Scope 1 shipping emissions 0.26 0.31 0.32 0.34      Gross Scope 1 emissions (excl shipping) 1.94 1.91 2.08 1.93 Gross Scope 2 emissions 0.35 0.33 0.16 0.16 Total Net Scope 1 and 2 emissions 2.21 2.28 2.36 2.43 Emission reduction through offsets 0.34 0.26  0.20  –  Emissions intensity in electricity generation    (CO₂/mt ore processed)  3.31 3.32  3.50  3.49  Energy consumed Diesel consumption (million litres) 633 634  700  641  Natural gas consumption (PJ) 4.1 3.4  3.6  3.6  Other (PJ) 0.4 0.6  0.5  0.4  Non-renewable electricity purchased (GWh) 567 494  260  260  Renewable electricity purchased (GWh) 145.7 87.7  0.7  0.4  Total net energy consumed (PJ) 31.5 30.6  32.0  29.7  Scope 3 emissions (million tonnes CO₂-e) Crude steel manufacturing  261.46 250.37  242.83  – Chartered cargo shipping  2.86** 3.16*  2.96* – Purchased good and services  2.50 2.07  1.84  – Capital goods  0.12 0.27  0.52  – Fuel and energy refining and transport  0.50 0.12  0.12  – Employee commuting  0.03 0.10  0.06  – Business travel  0.03 0.03  0.02  – Upstream leased assets 0.11 – – – Total gross Scope 3 emissions  267.61 256.14*  248.34*  A dash (-) indicates where data has not been reported in previous years. *Restated numbers, reasoning detailed in section Shipping Emissions Methodology Changes **FY23 value of 2.86mt includes less than 0.08mt of non-chartered cargo vessel upstream transportation and distribution emissions in addition to the  chartered cargo shipping emissions of 2.78mt GHG emissions data from FY20 – FY23  ===== PAGE 72 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    70 Directors' report TRUCK INFO DIRECTORS'  REPORT 07 First ore loaded  to train at Belinga  Iron Ore Project   in Gabon 2023  ===== PAGE 73 ===== Director Ordinary shares Share rights Dr A Forrest AO 1,131,365,000 – M Barnaba AM 40,300 – E Gaines 341,294 204,627 Dr J Baderschneider 138,000 – Lord S Coe CH, KBE 5,000 – P Bingham-Hall 59,861 – J Morris OAM (resigned 30 June 2023) – – Dr Y Zhang (resigned 22 November 2022) – – L Yifei (appointed 22 August 2022) – – ¹FY23 Corporate Governance Statement is available on Fortescue’s website at www.fortescue.com The remuneration of Directors and Key Management Personnel are detailed in the  Remuneration Report on pages 74 to 108.

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank  Jenn Morris for her dedication over the last six and a half  years as a Non-Executive Director and the past four years as  Chair of the Committee. FY23 Fortescue performance FY23 was another year of record operational performance  for Fortescue coupled with several firsts for the business,  all while achieving an industry-leading safety performance.  These achievements are further reflected in the exceptional  results achieved across our key operations and in our  financial and strategic measures.  This year saw the first high-grade magnetite production at  Iron Bridge delivering first-run grade of over 68% Fe. This  achievement was the culmination of years of dedication  from over 20,000 people to deliver the highly complex and  innovative project. Our ongoing commitment to the long- term sustainability of our iron ore business was further  strengthened through progress in Gabon at the Belinga Iron  Ore Project. During FY23 we saw the signing of the Mining  Convention, successful early-stage exploration and first ore  delivered to port. These remarkable achievements place  Fortescue on track to deliver first shipment of iron ore from  Gabon by the end of calendar year 2023.  There were also significant advancements against our  commitment to reach real zero Scope 1 and 2 terrestrial  emissions across our Australian iron ore operations by 2030.  This includes delivery of the first prototype battery system  designed for zero-emissions battery electric haul trucks  and live testing of zero-emissions vehicles at our Christmas  Creek site. Fortescue remains well positioned to profitably  decarbonise our operations and transition to the number 1  integrated green technology, energy and metals company.  These results were delivered despite significant market  pressures, including higher than forecast inflation and  ongoing skills shortages.  Fortescue’s delivery of another year of consistent, reliable  and sustainable performance would not have been possible  without the hard work and commitment of the entire  Fortescue team. The Board remain incredibly grateful to the  entire workforce and thank them for once again delivering  these outstanding results. The wellbeing and safety of our  people remains a key focus area, with a diverse and inclusive  workplace aligned to our Values at the core of our success. In  FY23, we continued to progress a number of actions through  our ongoing Workplace Integrity Review including a range of  initiatives to enhance physical and personal safety. To ensure  Fortescue continues to deliver on its strategic commitments,  the business underwent organisational change throughout  the year. The impact to employees was reflected in the  results of the People Experience Survey, with the Net  Promoter Score dropping 10 points compared to the FY22  result. The Executive team are working through the feedback  received and are committed to acting on it. However, it is  pleasing to report that overall employee turnover of 9%  continues to be well below industry benchmarks. Please refer to Section 3 of the Report for further business  performance highlights. Senior Leadership changes During FY23 we announced changes to our senior  leadership, with Elizabeth Gaines transitioning from CEO  to a Non-Executive Director and commencing a new role  as Global Ambassador for the Fortescue Group. Elizabeth  Gaines transitioned to Executive Director position in July  2023. Mark Hutchinson was appointed CEO of FFI in August  2022, subsequently becoming CEO Fortescue Energy, and  has already delivered a number of significant milestones. Following the departure of Ian Wells as CFO, we announced  the appointment of Christine Morris to the role of CFO of  Fortescue Metals. Christine commenced with Fortescue  in July 2023. We were also pleased to announce the  appointment of Deborah Caudle as CFO of Fortescue Energy,  commencing in September 2023. These appointments complement the existing leadership  team and ensure Fortescue has the talent in place to deliver  on the critical next phase of our business. In February 2023, Fiona Hick was appointed CEO of  Fortescue Metals. In August 2023 Fiona departed as CEO.  Dino Otranto was appointed.  ===== PAGE 78 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    76 Directors' report FY23 remuneration outcomes Our remuneration framework is designed to be competitive  in attracting and retaining the best talent, while also aligning  with shareholder expectations by setting challenging stretch  targets when rewarding for performance. As our business continues to evolve, and in listening to  feedback from our shareholders, we made two changes to  our incentive framework for FY23.  Firstly, changes have been made to the FFI Long Term  Incentive Plan (LTIP) structure to ensure it remains  strategically aligned to the whole business. For the FY23  LTIP performance period, the independent valuation metric  has been removed with the weighting redistributed between  Total Shareholder Return and Emissions Elimination &  Strategic Measures.  Secondly, the cliff-vesting approach to determining  Executive and Senior Staff Incentive Plan (ESSIP) outcomes  for our Metals business has been replaced with a sliding  scale methodology with vesting outcomes at threshold,  target and stretch levels of performance, aligned to the  approach taken for FFI in FY22.  The Board maintains a holistic view of performance when  assessing outcomes. Consideration is given to what the  Board determines to be a fair outcome in the circumstances,  taking account of what was delivered by executives, how it  was delivered in alignment with Fortescue’s Values and the  experience and expectations of shareholders. A summary of performance and the link to remuneration  outcomes is set out in the Report.  Fixed remuneration To remain competitive in a tight market for talent and  aligned with benchmarks, a three per cent increase was  applied to eligible Key Management Personnel (KMP) total  fixed remuneration (TFR) levels effective 1 July 2022 as  outlined in section 4. The remuneration of the new CEOs was  set with reference to peers and aligned with the previous  CEO remuneration.     FY23 ESSIP The Board set aggressive stretch targets for the FY23 ESSIP  to drive business operations, financial performance, and  maximise shareholder value. FY23 ESSIP performance conditions included operational,  people and culture, and individual KPIs. Overall, the FY23  ESSIP outcomes for the CEO and other KMP ranged from   85.0 per cent to 88.6 per cent of target.  Section 4 of the Report provides further detail regarding the  targets and their achievement. FY21 LTIP Vesting of the FY21 LTIP is assessed over a three year  performance period from 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2023  against combined Return on Equity (ROE), Total Shareholder  Return (TSR) and strategic measures aligned with the  Company’s long-term objectives.  The performance conditions for the FY21 LTIP were tested  and vested at 100 per cent based on outstanding TSR and  ROE performance and partial progress against challenging  strategic measures.  Aligned with the LTIP Maximum Value Limit, a 50 per cent  cap was applied to the grant price of $14.15, resulting in   96.6 per cent of the awards vesting.  Special recognition awards In recognition of the exceptional performance and  contributions throughout their tenures, the Board  approved special recognition payments of A$1.976m for  Elizabeth Gaines and A$1.0m for Ian Wells. The Board  determined these values given their respective significant  and transformative achievements during their time  with Fortescue. Under Elizabeth’s leadership as CEO,  Fortescue generated record earnings for shareholders,  continued to drive improvement in our safety outcomes  and increased shipments of iron ore, including during the  Covid-19 pandemic. During her tenure, Fortescue also  made significant progress in ESG, autonomy and advanced  technology, positioning Fortescue as one of the most  efficient iron ore companies in the world. As CFO and during  his 12 years in the finance team at Fortescue, Ian ensured  Fortescue’s balance sheet remained strong and market  leading shareholder returns were delivered through several  volatile market cycles and the pandemic. Elizabeth will  continue to participate in the FY21 and FY22 LTIP on a pro- rata basis as previously approved by shareholders. Ian has  not retained any ongoing eligibility to participate in unvested  long-term incentives. Neither Elizabeth nor Ian will receive  any award under the FY23 ESSIP.  ===== PAGE 79 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    77 Corporate governance Operating and   financial review Corporate directory Our approach to   sustainability Our approach to   climate change Directors' report    |  Remuneration Report  Financial report Overview Ore Reserves and  Mineral Resources FY24 remuneration changes Our executive remuneration framework remains under review  as our operating model and strategy continue to evolve.  Looking forward to FY24, we will look to continue to drive the  link between variable remuneration and our decarbonisation  journey for all employees across our business. We will also look to streamline our ESSIP scorecards and LTIP  measures across the Metals and Energy businesses for FY24. A market increase of four per cent for executives’ fixed  remuneration is planned for FY24 in line with the broader  employee annual salary review to ensure remuneration  remains competitive against market peers. I invite you to read our Report and trust you will find it  outlines the links between our strategy, culture, performance  and executive remuneration outcomes.

BUSINESS PERFORMANCE Fortescue delivered strong performance across many of  our stretch safety, production and financial targets in FY23.  These achievements were thanks to the dedicated efforts  of the entire Fortescue team and are underpinned by our  unique culture and Values and our strong focus on cost  management and operating excellence.  The health, safety and wellbeing of all of our people is  engrained in our culture and at the centre of everything we  do, as reflected in our safety performance for the year. In  the 12 months to 30 June 2023, our TRIFR for our Metals  business was maintained at 1.8. While this is an outstanding  and industry-leading result, we are committed to continually  improving our safety culture and working towards achieving  zero harm across all our workplaces.  Operating performance delivered record results in FY23  with iron ore shipments of 192.0mt, representing Fortescue’s  highest ever annual shipment and achieving the top end  of market guidance. The first shipment of magnetite from  our Iron Bridge operations was achieved in July. While  this achievement was later than planned, commissioning  is underway and a transition to operational production is  anticipated to be achieved in Q1 FY24. Iron Bridge delivers  diversification in Fortescue’s offering through a high-grade  product and increases production capacity. This, coupled  with our progress in Gabon through the Belinga Iron Ore  Project, demonstrates our ongoing commitment to the long  term sustainability of our business. C1 cost in FY23 was US$17.54/wmt, a 10 per cent increase  on the C1 cost in FY22. C1 cost continues to be impacted by  significant cost pressures, including external inflationary  factors impacting diesel, labour rates, energy and other  input costs. Despite these challenges, Fortescue maintains  our industry-leading cost position and our sustaining capital  expenditure was slightly below target.  Fortescue’s financial performance for the year was  underpinned by consistent operating performance, strong  customer demand, record shipments and an optimised  product mix to deliver underlying net profit after tax of  US$5,522m. This represents a decrease of 11 per cent on  FY22, largely as a result of a reduction in price realisations  reflecting the iron ore index.   Progress was made throughout FY23 in our plan to  decarbonise Fortescue’s operations against our target for  Scope 1 and 2 emissions across our Australian iron ore  operations. Notable achievements included the live testing  of a battery electric haul truck prototype at our Christmas  Creek site using innovative battery technology developed by  Fortescue WAE. We were also able to test on our rail network  a retrofitted locomotive capable of running on dual fuel with  ammonia.  More broadly across the Energy business, we progressed  a number of key projects including the expansion of  Fortescue WAE’s battery powertrain operations in the UK  and completion of the construction phase of the Gladstone  electrolyser manufacturing facility in Queensland. Significant  advancements were also made against our global portfolio  of green energy projects and in deepening relationships with  offtake customers around the world.    Looking forward, we are focused on delivering against our  growth strategy to the benefit of all our stakeholders. With  our investments in growth through Iron Bridge, Belinga and  the Fortescue Energy portfolio, we are well placed to be the  number 1 integrated green technology, energy and metals  company and ensure our stakeholders continue to benefit  from Fortescue’s success.  ===== PAGE 85 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    83 Corporate governance Operating and   financial review Corporate directory Our approach to   sustainability Our approach to   climate change Directors' report    |  Remuneration Report  Financial report Overview Ore Reserves and  Mineral Resources 192.0mt PRODUCTION US$17.54/wmt COST 1.8¹ SAFETY US$16,871m REVENUE US$1,211m SUSTAINING CAPEX   US$/wmt Cost The following graphs show our Group performance against  key financial measures in FY23: FY22 4,449 FY20 4,251 FY23 17.54 FY23 12.94 FY20 FY21 13.93 FY22 15.91 FY21 FY20 FY23 Revenue US$m Free cash flow US$m Production wmt  FY23 192.0 FY22 189.0 FY21 FY20 178.2 FY19 167.7 FY19 13.11 8,961 FY21 FY19 3,328 FY22 FY19 9,965 TOTAL RECORDABLE   INJURY FREQUENCY RATE CULTURE +25¹ FORTESCUE EMPLOYEE  NET PROMOTER SCORE 182.2 3,572 12,820 22,284 17,390 16,871 1 Fortescue Metals  ===== PAGE 86 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    84 Directors' report The graphs below shows Fortescue’s EBITDA vs ESSIP outcomes and TSR vs LTIP outcomes over the last three years.

REMUNERATION OUTCOMES As reported in Section 3, Fortescue has again delivered  strong, consistent results against the majority of our key  targets for FY23, underpinned by our Values based culture  and the commitment of the entire Fortescue team. a.	 FY23 fixed remuneration changes A market review of KMP fixed remuneration was undertaken  as part of Fortescue’s broader annual salary review process.

FY23 ESSIP performance outcomes Fortescue’s short term incentive arrangements are designed  to focus executives on both ‘what’ must be achieved  (financial targets), as well as ‘how’ it should be achieved  (non-financial targets and individual KPIs). Our ESSIP  operations, people and culture, and individual KPIs have  direct and quantifiable impacts on the Company.  Historically Fortescue has used a cliff-vesting approach  for the ESSIP. Based on the success experienced with a  sliding scale approach for FFI in FY22, and in response to  shareholder feedback, a sliding scale approach has now  been adopted for the Fortescue Metals ESSIP. Stretch  targets are set in line with our culture and Values, with  outcomes for threshold and on-target levels of performance  also set.

FY21 LTIP performance outcomes Each LTIP performance measure has a minimum performance hurdle for vesting with increasing levels applicable to each individual  measure. There is an ability to earn up to 150 per cent of any individual measure by achieving stretch performance; however, the  overall cap for the LTIP is 100 per cent of the maximum number of share rights granted. The FY21 LTIP was tested over the period from 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2023. The Company has achieved the performance measures  shown in the table below.

Strategic measures (34%) Strategic measures 5.4 out  of 15 31.3 Progress has been made in  Fortescue’s overall business  strategy. Iron Bridge: First Ore on Ship (FOOS) achieved for Iron Bridge  in March 2022 and all project finance step-downs completed in  accordance with the Project Funding commissioning requirements. Not achieved First ore on ship not  achieved in FY23. Pilbara Energy Connect (PEC): project successfully constructed  and implemented with 25-30% of stationary energy sourced from  renewables and a pathway identified to achieve a 26% reduction  in emissions from existing operations from 2020 levels, by 2030.  The pathway to include a mobile fleet solution and other initiatives  subject to Board approval. Achieved Transmission line component  of original PEC complete.  Decarbonisation pathway  to real zero developed,  exceeding original target of  26% reduction. FFI: Establish FFI with governance and funding structures  identified to achieve the following, subject to Board approval;  Establish a ‘proof of concept’ H-H project in established  hydropower markets such as Australia or New Zealand; Convert  as a minimum one of the international opportunities identified  on the 2020 H-H global trip from a Deed of Agreement to  defined project and supporting agreements (covering tax, risk  management and royalties) with an agreed business case and  funding identified to deliver on an international H-H project. Not achieved FFI strategy has evolved  significantly since the  KPI was established,  deprioritising hydropower. Iron Ore Growth: Subject to Board approval, grow through  exploration and/or acquisition of iron ore resources to sustain mine  life and develop a pipeline of growth opportunities for the iron ore  operations. Achieved Acquisition of Mindy South  and commencement of  mining in Gabon Copper: Develop a pipeline of projects and exploration targets  for South America (or elsewhere if approved by the Board) with  the aim of creating a world leading copper producing hub for  Fortescue. Partly  Achieved Portfolio of copper  exploration options has  increased across Argentina,  Chile, Peru, Kazakhstan, and  Australia. Beyond copper,  rare earth elements options  secured in Brazil. Heritage: Maintain relationships with native title partners and  continue to adopt a strategy of avoiding sites of significant  cultural heritage value whilst at the same time securing  approvals to achieve mine plan objectives and adhering to the  requirements of the Aboriginal Heritage Act. Achieved Fortescue has continued to  follow the strategy of avoiding  sites of significant cultural  heritage.  Industry-leading approaches  to access inventory, e.g. co- management plans with TO  groups, have been developed.

US$  ===== PAGE 96 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    94 Directors' report Element Description Delivery At the start of the performance period, participants elect the portion of award they wish to receive in rights  with the remaining award to be delivered as cash. The plan allows Executives to elect to receive up to 100% of  awards in equity (a minimum of 50% must be elected to be received by way of share rights). Each share right, if vested, entitles the participant to an ordinary share in Fortescue for nil consideration. Performance   period One year (i.e. 1 July to 30 June). Valuing   awards The number of ESSIP share rights are calculated based on the VWAP of Fortescue shares traded over the  first five trading days of the performance period. As such: •	 If the share price at the time of vesting is higher, Executives will receive higher value per share right. •	 If the share price at the time of vesting is lower, the value to Executives is decreased. The value of share rights is therefore aligned with shareholder interests from the beginning of the  performance period as executives receive value consistent with share price movements. Performance   measures The Board continues to recognise the importance of focusing on operational and strategic targets with  people and culture also being a key driver of success. In FY23, the Board set a number of challenging targets for Fortescue Metals and FFI (noted below).  The Board determined the relative weighting and mix of performance objectives for KMP and Executives to  deliver long term sustainable shareholder value. Further details of performance measures for FY23 are disclosed at Section 4 above.  FORTESCUE METALS FFI The Board set a number of challenging targets in  respect to operations, including production, safety,  cost and revenue across all operating and support  functions: •	 The operational measures were chosen as they  represent the key drivers of financial performance  (underlying EBITDA) of the Company and provide  a framework for delivering long term shareholder  value, irrespective of the iron ore price. •	 The inclusion of a people and culture metric  recognises the importance of supporting the  Company’s differentiated culture underpinned by  its core Values, which is fundamental to corporate  success.  •	 Individual KPIs focus on critical objectives  and are set at stretch levels of performance  with measures and weightings aligned to the  individual’s ability to influence outcomes such as  the delivery of a project and business expansion. The Board set a number of challenging targets specific  to FFI business including safety, delivery of projects  in Australia and globally, as well as decarbonisation  and green industry across all operating and support  functions: •	 The measures were chosen as they represent the key  drivers of financial performance of FFI and provide  a framework for delivering long term shareholder  value. •	 The inclusion of a people and culture metric  recognises the importance of supporting a culture  which is fundamental to success in Australia and  globally.  •	 Similar to Fortescue Metals, individual KPIs focus  on critical objectives and are set at stretch levels of  performance with measures and weightings aligned  to the individual’s ability to influence outcomes such  as the delivery of a project and business expansion. 5.	 INCENTIVE PLAN OPERATION The purpose of the ESSIP and LTIP is to incentivise and reward key Fortescue Executives (including KMP) for achieving  annual stretch Company and individual performance objectives that drive shareholder value. a.	 ESSIP Below we have set out the key terms of the ESSIP for FY23 (noting differences, where applicable, between Fortescue Metals  and FFI plans):  ===== PAGE 97 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    95 Corporate governance Operating and   financial review Corporate directory Our approach to   sustainability Our approach to   climate change Directors' report    |  Remuneration Report  Financial report Overview Ore Reserves and  Mineral Resources Element Description FORTESCUE METALS AND FFI Target setting Fortescue Metals and FFI set challenging ESSIP stretch targets and use a sliding scale for each individual  objective with vesting available for threshold, target and stretch levels of performance. The sliding scale  does not apply to safety objectives which are either met or not met. When deliberating on performance  outcomes, the Board considers the level of achievement against targets and may approve a stretch award  on each KPI to reflect the degree of performance by the business. While each individual KPI has the  opportunity to achieve stretch levels of performance, the overall outcome is capped at 100%. Performance Level % of Target Achieved % of Target Awarded Below threshold < 90% of Target Nil Threshold 90% of Target 10 Between threshold and target 95% of Target 50 Target 100% of Target 100 Stretch ≥ 120% of Target 150 Outcomes between performance levels are calculated on a linear basis. Board  discretion Awards under the ESSIP are at all times subject to the Board’s discretion. When deliberating on  performance outcomes, the Board follows a rigorous assessment process including:  •	 The degree of stretch in the measures and targets and the context in which the targets were set •	 The level of achievement against the stretch targets •	 The operating environment over the performance period and management’s ability to respond to  unforeseen events (e.g. cyclones, floods, fire, pandemic) •	 Financial performance and shareholder value generated •	 Global competitiveness and level of improvement compared to global peers during the period  •	 The level of improvement across key business drivers on the prior year •	 Any other relevant under or over performance or other criteria not stated above.  In circumstances where performance against stretch targets is not accurately reflected in the level of  achievement against stretch targets (whether under or over), the Board may exercise its discretion to  increase or decrease the vesting level of the incentive and therefore the value awarded. This exercise of  discretion and the reasons for it, will be clearly communicated in our Remuneration Report.  ===== PAGE 98 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    96 Directors' report b.	 LTIP The LTIP operates under the Performance Rights Plan Rules as approved by Shareholders at the Company’s Annual General  Meeting on 9 November 2021. Below we have set out the key terms of the LTIP for FY23: Element Description Delivery Share rights   Each share right entitles Executives (subject to achievement of the performance conditions) to one fully  paid ordinary share in Fortescue for nil consideration. Performance  period Three years Performance  measures –  summary The relative weighting between financial and strategic measures provides the ability to assess  performance across a cyclical market. The inclusion of strategic measures is deliberate to ensure  alignment between short and long-term value creation by ensuring long-term value is not compromised. FORTESCUE METALS FFI Performance measure breakdown   Total Shareholder Return (33%) Return on Equity (33%) Key Strategic Measures (34%) Performance measure breakdown   Total Shareholder Return (40%) Emissions Reduction and Strategic Measures  (60%) Each LTIP performance measure has a minimum performance hurdle for vesting with increasing levels  applicable to each individual measure. There is an ability to earn up to 150% of any individual measure  by achieving stretch performance. Each individual measure contributes to the overall result with vested  rights awarded based on the aggregate of the measures. Vesting between performance levels is calculated on a linear basis with the stretch element considered  together with the achievement of all performance measures and subject to the aggregate performance  cap. While each individual performance measure includes stretch targets, with a relative contribution  on any individual measure of up to 150%, the overall cap for the LTIP is 100% of the maximum number of  share rights granted. FORTESCUE METALS AND FFI Performance  and vesting  conditions Relative TSR performance measure Relative TSR is a measure of the performance of the Company’s shares over a three year period against  the ASX 100 Resources Index. It combines share price appreciation and dividends paid to show the total  return to the shareholder expressed as a percentage. Relative TSR hurdles are valuable because the  Company needs to outperform a peer group of participants to receive any reward and therefore, is aligned  to relative market performance. The comparator group for the FY23 grant comprises the companies in the ASX 100 Resources Index. The  ASX 100 Resources Index has been chosen as the comparator group because this is a transparent market  indicator, includes Fortescue’s ASX listed commodity market peers and represents the peer group that  Fortescue competes with for investment.  When formulating the vesting schedule for the TSR performance measure, the Board considered both  local and international market practice. In line with the Company’s approach to setting stretch targets, the  Board determined that a vesting schedule more aggressive than standard market practice was required  in order to align executive reward for this performance measure with superior shareholder returns. The  vesting criteria for both threshold and target have been set at the 60th percentile and 80th percentile  (respectively), higher than standard market practice. The plan also provides for a premium grant of awards  (subject to the cap described above) where Fortescue delivers the market leading total shareholder return  over the performance period. The TSR vesting schedule is as follows:  ===== PAGE 99 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    97 Corporate governance Operating and   financial review Corporate directory Our approach to   sustainability Our approach to   climate change Directors' report    |  Remuneration Report  Financial report Overview Ore Reserves and  Mineral Resources Element Description FORTESCUE METALS FFI Performance  and vesting  conditions  (continued) LTIP TSR target and vesting schedule Performance Average TSR Portion of tranche that vests Below threshold Below the 60th percentile Nil Threshold At the 60th percentile 25% of share rights vest Target At the 80th percentile 100% of share rights vest Stretch At the 100th percentile 150% of share rights vest Vesting between performance levels is calculated on a linear basis with the stretch element considered  together with the achievement of all performance measures and subject to the aggregate performance cap. The Board acknowledge that a relative TSR hurdle can result in unintended outcomes. The intent is to ensure  no windfall gains or undue penalty. In the event that absolute TSR is negative, but the relative TSR hurdle is  achieved, the Board will consider overall performance and circumstances and may, at its absolute discretion,  reduce the level of vesting or determine that no award will be made in respect to the TSR measure. FORTESCUE METALS FFI ROE performance measure ROE has been used as a measure in Fortescue’s   LTIP for some time now and measures how  effectively management is using Fortescue’s   assets to create profits. The ROE vesting schedule is as follows: The ROE performance measure does not apply to the  FFI LTIP grant.

The strategic objectives devised  by the Board specifically relate to key milestones and objectives that are fundamental to the Company’s  sustainability, continuing development and growth and delivery of shareholder value.  In line with the recommendations of the Remuneration and People Committee, the LTIP performance  measures comprise strategic measures with associated key performance indicators for the Company  aimed at directing performance towards the Company’s long-term objectives.  The strategic measures for the FY23 grant are set out below. Strategic measures Fortescue Metals FFI Targets with respect to  Decarbonisation Green industry Green iron Mobile fleet and stationary power Belinga iron ore development Financials (CAPEX & revenue) Access to inventory/   iron ore resources Projects Diversity Whether a strategic objective has been achieved is measured at the end of the three-year performance  period on an outcome basis (and subject to Board discretion) with vesting as follows: LTIP strategic measure target and vesting schedule Performance Score Portion of tranche that vests Below threshold <5 Nil Threshold 5 25 per cent of share rights vest Target 10 100 per cent of share rights vest Stretch 15 150 per cent of share rights vest Board  discretion The LTIP is subject at all times to the Board’s absolute discretion.  The terms of the FY21 LTIP include a Maximum Value Limit, which caps the number of share rights  that will vest in circumstances where there has been a significant increase in share price over the  performance period. The Maximum Value Limit baseline is 50% share price growth over the performance  period noting that the Board may approve higher levels of vesting when considering Company  performance and/or any other fact, event or circumstance that may impact the outcomes of the LTIP. In  determining the level of the Maximum Value Limit to be applied, the Board will have consideration to any  perceived windfall gain in Fortescue’s share price, influenced in part by iron ore prices outside the control  of management.  ===== PAGE 101 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    99 Corporate governance Operating and   financial review Corporate directory Our approach to   sustainability Our approach to   climate change Directors' report    |  Remuneration Report  Financial report Overview Ore Reserves and  Mineral Resources c.	 General terms applying to equity awards The occurrence of particular events may affect the grant and vesting of the ESSIP and LTIP equity awards. The table below  outlines how these awards may be addressed, noting that the Board at all times maintains an overriding and absolute discretion  with respect to the incentive plans: Element ESSIP LTIP What  happens on  cessation of  employment Unless the Board exercises its discretion under  the ESSIP rules, unvested performance rights will  be forfeited on cessation for individuals who leave  during the year (i.e. before 30 June). Individuals who commence during the year will have  awards under the ESSIP pro-rated based on service  during the performance period. Unless the Board exercises its discretion under  the LTIP rules, unvested performance rights will  be forfeited on cessation for individuals who leave  during the year (i.e. before 30 June). Malus and  Clawback  Policy Fortescue operates a Malus and Clawback Policy which applies to both the ESSIP and LTIP. The Policy will  be initiated where in the opinion of the Board: •	 a Participant has engaged in fraud, dishonesty or gross misconduct, breached his or her obligations to  the Group or there is a material misstatement of financial information •	 an Award, which would not have otherwise vested, vests or may vest as a result of the fraud, dishonesty  or breach of obligations of any other person •	 circumstances have occurred that result in an unfair benefit being obtained by any Participant. The Board’s discretion, with respect to the operation of the Policy, is considered standard market practice  and an appropriate mechanism to ensure the Board has sufficient flexibility to respond to changing or  unexpected circumstances (should they arise). Change of  control The performance period end date will generally be brought forward to the date of the change of control  and awards will vest over this shortened period, subject to ultimate Board discretion.  ===== PAGE 102 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    100 Directors' report A$ Position Executive TFR (A$)1 Maximum ESSIP  opportunity Maximum LTIP  opportunity Nominal value of  total remuneration  package at  maximum  opportunity A$ % of TFR A$ % of TFR A$ CEO E Gaines² 2,080,000 112.5 2,340,000 150 3,120,000 7,540,000 CEO Metals F Hick³ 2,080,000 112.5 2,340,000 150 3,120,000 7,540,000 CEO Energy M Hutchinson⁴ 2,000,000 112.5 2,250,000 150 3,000,000 7,250,000 COO Metals D Otranto 1,287,500  75 965,625  100  1,287,500  3,540,625  CEO FFI J Shuttleworth⁵ 1,103,336 75 827,502 100 1,103,336 3,034,174 CFO I Wells⁶ 1,124,549 75 843,412 100 1,124,549 3,092,510 ¹ Includes superannuation and allowances.

KMP are required to provide written notice of six months  (as specified in their individual service agreement) to terminate their employment. Contractual termination benefits for KMP  comply with the limits set by the Corporations Act 2001. KMP are remunerated on a TFR basis inclusive of superannuation and allowances.

Non-Executive Directors do not receive retirement benefits, nor do they participate in any incentive programs of the Company. a.	 Non-Executive Director remuneration policy and fees Fortescue’s policy on Non-Executive Director remuneration requires that Non-Executive Director fees are: •	 Not ‘at risk’ to reflect the nature of their responsibilities and safeguard their independence; and •	 Market competitive with fees set at levels comparable with Non-Executive Director remuneration of comparable  companies. The maximum aggregate remuneration payable to Non-Executive Directors is A$4.5 million, which was approved by  shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 22 November 2022.  Most Non-Executive Directors receive fees for both Board and Committee membership (the exception being the Executive  Chairman, who has elected to forgo all Board fees). The payment of additional fees for serving on a Committee recognises  the additional time commitment required by Non-Executive Directors who serve on a Committee. b.	 Exertion payment – Elizabeth Gaines To recognise the additional work, time and travel commitment associated with the Global Ambassador role, in additon to  her day-to-day Board and Committee duties, the Board approved a one-off exertion cash payment to Elizabeth Gaines of  A$794,836. As disclosed to the market in June 2023, Elizabeth has transitioned to an Executive Director position effective  from 1 July 2023 to better reflect the requirements of the role. c.	 Non-executive Director Salary Sacrifice Share Rights Plan Non-Executive Directors may choose to sacrifice a portion or all of their base fees (excluding Committee fees and Company  superannuation contributions) to be used to acquire vested rights to Fortescue shares under the Non-Executive Director  Salary Sacrifice Share Rights Plan. Shares, to the gross value of the amount salary sacrificed, are purchased on market twice a year following the announcement  of Fortescue’s half and full year results in February and August. The VWAP at the time of purchase is used to determine the number of vested rights to be allocated to Non-Executive  Directors. Vested rights may be exercised at any time, up to 15 years from date of grant. Shares will be held by Pacific Custodians (as Trustee) until the vested rights are exercised into shares. Vested rights and  shares acquired under this Plan are not subject to performance conditions because they are issued in lieu of salary which  would otherwise be payable to the relevant Non-Executive Director.  ===== PAGE 104 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    102 Directors' report 8.	 REMUNERATION GOVERNANCE Fortescue believes that robust governance is critical to underpinning the effectiveness of the remuneration strategy. a.	 Remuneration and People Committee The Remuneration and People Committee (RPC) operates under a Board-approved Charter. The purpose of the RPC is to  provide assistance and recommendations to the Board to ensure that it is able to fulfil its responsibilities. The RPC in FY23 consisted solely of Non-Executive Directors. The Chief Executive Officers and others may be invited to  attend all or part of meetings by the RPC Chair as required but have no vote on matters before the RPC. A copy of the RPC Charter is available from the Corporate Governance section of our website at www.fortescue.com  REMUNERATION CONSULTANTS •  May be engaged directly by the Board  or RPC to provide advice or information  relating to KMP that is free from influence of  management. •  Will be engaged directly by management  other than in respect of KMP to   provide data to ensure Fortescue’s  remuneration position   remains competitive. During the year ended 30 June 2023,  the Committee sought advice from  remuneration consultants from time to time  for remuneration advisory services. This  did not involve providing the RPC with any  remuneration recommendations as   defined by the Corporations Act 2001. BOARD OF DIRECTORS •  Approve the remuneration of   Non-Executive Directors and CEO •  Ensure remuneration practices are  competitive and strategic and align  with the attraction and retention  policies of the Company Board of  Directors Human Resources  Management Remuneration Consultants Board Remuneration  and People  Committee BOARD REMUNERATION AND   PEOPLE COMMITTEE Advise the Board on: •  Remuneration strategy, policies and  practices •  NED and senior executive remuneration •  Committee member appointments  •  Senior executive recruitment and the  Company’s recruitment, ESSIP, LTIP,  retention and termination policies and  annual performance reviews •  Succession planning and talent  management •  Diversity strategy and gender pay equity  HUMAN RESOURCES  MANAGEMENT •  Implement of remuneration  policies and practices •  Advise the RPC of changing  statutory and market conditions •  Provide relevant information to  the RPC to assist with decisions b.	 Minimum shareholding conditions All Directors and employees are encouraged to own Fortescue shares and the Company enables employee participation as a  shareholder through short and long-term incentives, salary sacrifice and dividend reinvestment programs. A minimum shareholding policy applies to Directors and Executives to support a long-term focus and further strengthen  alignment with shareholders. The minimum shareholding required is as follows: Non-Executive Directors: 100 per cent of annual base fee CEO¹: 200 per cent of total fixed remuneration Other Executive KMP: 100 per cent of total fixed remuneration ¹ Applies to Fortescue Metals and Fortescue Energy CEOs. Participants are required to meet their respective minimum shareholding within a reasonable timeframe, generally within   five years from the effective date of the policy, or the date of their appointment, if later. The Directors’ and Executives’ Shareholding   Policy can be accessed from the Corporate Governance section of our website at  www.fortescue.com c.	 Board discretion The Committee and the Board consider it critical that they are able to exercise full and appropriate discretion in order to ensure   that remuneration outcomes for Executives appropriately reflect the performance of individuals, the Group, and meet the   expectations of shareholders.  ===== PAGE 105 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    103 Corporate governance Operating and   financial review Corporate directory Our approach to   sustainability Our approach to   climate change Directors' report    |  Remuneration Report  Financial report Overview Ore Reserves and  Mineral Resources 9.

KMP share rights Share rights granted under the ESSIP at the beginning of FY23 (granted at the VWAP for Fortescue shares traded over  the first five trading days of the performance year) based on the participants election of performance rights (ranging  from a minimum of 50 per cent up to a maximum of 100 per cent). Share rights granted under the LTIP at the beginning of  FY21 which vested in FY23 are shown below. The ultimate value of these share rights to the Executives will reflect either  an improvement or decline in the Company’s share price over the performance period. The adoption of this approach  is specifically to ensure that awards made to Executives have a value which reflects sustainable value of shareholder’s  investment in the Company.

Financial report Overview Ore Reserves and  Mineral Resources The financial statements cover the consolidated group  comprising Fortescue Metals Group Ltd (the Company)  and its subsidiaries, together referred to as Fortescue or  the Group. The Company is a for-profit company limited  by shares and incorporated in Australia, whose shares are  publicly traded on the Australian Stock Exchange.  These general purpose financial statements have been  prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting  Standards, other authoritative pronouncements of the  Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB), including  Australian Interpretations, and the Corporations Act 2001.  (a) Compliance with IFRS  The financial statements of the Group also comply with  International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued  by the International Accounting Standards Board.  (b) Historical cost convention  The financial statements have been prepared under the  historical cost convention, except for certain financial  instruments, which have been measured at fair value.  (c) Functional and presentation currency  The financial statements are presented in United States  dollars, which is the Group’s reporting currency and the  functional currency of the Company and the majority of its  significant subsidiaries.  (d) Critical accounting estimates  The preparation of financial statements requires  management to use estimates, judgements and  assumptions. Application of different assumptions and  estimates may have a significant impact on Fortescue’s net  assets and financial results. Estimates and assumptions are  reviewed on an ongoing basis and are based on the latest  available information at each reporting date. Actual results  may differ from the estimates.  The areas involving a higher degree of judgement and  complexity, or areas where assumptions are significant to  the financial statements are:  •	 Iron ore reserve estimates  • 	 Exploration and evaluation expenditure - recoverable  amount • 	 Development expenditure - recoverable amount  • 	 Property, plant and equipment - recoverable amount  • 	 Rehabilitation estimates  • 	 Revenue • 	 Joint arrangements • 	 Fair value measurement of financial assets. The accounting estimates and judgements applied to these  areas are disclosed in note 25.  (e) Rounding of amounts  All amounts in the financial statements have been rounded  to the nearest million dollars, except as indicated, in  accordance with the ASIC Corporations Instrument 2016/191. Notes to the consolidated financial statements    For the year ended 30 June 2023 BASIS OF PREPARATION 01  Basis of preparation  ===== PAGE 118 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    116 Financial report Notes to the consolidated financial statements    For the year ended 30 June 2023 Fortescue’s chief operating decision-makers are identified  as the Chief Executive Officer of Fortescue Metals and  the Chief Executive Officer of Fortescue Energy, and its  segments are identified based on the internal reports that  are reviewed and used by the Chief Executive Officers in  assessing performance and determining the allocation of  resources. The following operating segments have been  identified:  • 	 Metals: Exploration, development, production,  processing, sale and transportation of iron ore, and the  exploration for other minerals. • 	 Energy: Undertaking activities in the global development  of green electricity, green hydrogen and green ammonia  projects. FFI is included within the Energy segment. The scope of the operating segments has been modified  following the changes in management responsibilities in  2023. Energy segment now includes WAE Technologies Ltd  (Fortescue WAE, formerly Williams Advanced Engineering  Ltd) which was previously included in the Metals segment.  Accordingly, the comparative period 30 June 2022 in (a)  and (b) below has been restated to reflect the change in  segment structure.  Corporate includes cash, debt and tax balances which are  managed at a Group level, together with other corporate  activities. Corporate is not considered to be an operating  segment and includes activities that are not allocated to  other operating segments. Transfer prices between segments are set on an arm’s  length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third  parties. Where segment revenue, expenses and results  include transfers between segments, those transfers  are eliminated on consolidation and are not considered  material. (a) Underlying EBITDA Fortescue uses underlying EBITDA defined as earnings  before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation,  exploration, development and other expenses, and  impairment expense, as a key measure of its financial  performance.

Fortescue has developed target ranges for a number of financial indicators. These indicators include gearing, net gearing,  debt to underlying EBITDA and interest coverage ratio, and are monitored together with a number of other financial and  non-financial indicators. Target ranges for the financial ratios may vary upon the investment and commodity cycles. During  periods of intensive investment, for example expansion programs or a commodity downturn, the capital management policy  contemplates interim ratio levels returning to a targeted longer term level. Interim levels acknowledge and consider the  requirements, in certain circumstances, for remedial actions to be taken.  As per previous disclosures, Fortescue has a share buy-back program in place that is an important part of the capital  management strategy. The program was put in place in 2018 and was extended in October 2020 for an unlimited duration.

The remaining trade and other receivables are recognised at amortised cost using the  effective interest method, less an allowance for impairment. The Group applies the expected credit loss model to all receivables not held at fair value through profit or loss. A provision  for doubtful receivables is established based on the expected credit loss model and reviewed on an ongoing basis. Expected  credit losses on trade and other receivables held at amortised cost are insignificant and no provision has been recognised at  30 June 2023 (2022: nil). The carrying value of the receivables approximates their fair value.

Fortescue has  established a risk management framework that provides a structured approach to the identification and control of risks  across the business, sets the appropriate risk tolerance levels and incorporates active management of financial risks.  The risk management framework has been approved by the Board of Directors, through the Audit, Risk Management and  Sustainability Committee. The day-to-day management responsibility for execution of the risk management framework has  been delegated to the Metals CEO and Metals CFO. Periodically, the Metals CFO reports to the Audit, Risk Management and  Sustainability Committee on risk management performance, including management of financial risks.  The key elements of financial risk are further explained below. (a) Market risk Market risk arises from Fortescue’s exposure to commodity price risk and the use of interest bearing and foreign currency  financial instruments. It is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of  changes in iron ore (commodity price risk), interest rates (interest rate risk) or foreign exchange rates (foreign currency  exchange risk). (i) Commodity price risk Fortescue is exposed to commodity price risk, as its iron ore sales are predominantly subject to prevailing market prices.  Fortescue does not directly influence market prices of iron ore and manages the commodity price risk through a focus on  improving its cash margins and strengthening its corporate balance sheet through refinancing and early debt repayments.  The majority of Fortescue’s iron ore sales contracts are structured on a provisional pricing basis, with the final sales  price determined using the iron ore price indices on or after the vessel’s arrival to the port at discharge. The estimated  consideration in relation to the provisionally priced contracts is marked to market using the spot iron ore price at the end  of each reporting period, with the impact of the iron ore price movements recorded as provisional pricing adjustments to  revenue. At 30 June 2023, Fortescue had 2.6 million tonnes of iron ore sales (2022: 2.4 million tonnes) that remained subject  to provisional pricing, with the final price to be determined in the following financial year. A three per cent movement in the realised iron ore price on these provisionally priced sales would have an impact on the  Group’s profit of US$6 million (2022: 10 per cent movement would have an impact on the Group’s profit of US$18 million),  before the impact of taxation. This analysis assumes all other factors, including the foreign currency exchange rates, are held  constant.  ===== PAGE 130 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    128 Financial report Notes to the consolidated financial statements   For the year ended 30 June 2023 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 11 Financial risk management (continued) (a) Market risk (continued) (ii) Interest rate risk The Group’s interest rate risk arises from variable rates on the syndicated term loan, the revolving credit facility to the extent  it is drawn, and the lease liabilities relating to the ore carriers. Changes in rates applicable to the short-term deposits forming  part of cash and cash equivalents also give rise to interest rate risk. Fortescue’s policy is to reduce interest rate risk over the cash flows on its long-term debt funding through the use of fixed rate  instruments whenever appropriate.  Fortescue’s variable rate financial assets and liabilities at the end of the financial year are summarised below: Note 2023  US$m 2022  US$m Cash and cash equivalents 9(b) 2,693 2,636 Syndicated term loan 9(a) (975) (986) Lease liabilities (294) (320)   1,424 1,330 Management analyses the Group’s interest rate exposure on a regular basis by simulating various scenarios which take into  consideration refinancing, renewal of existing positions, alternative financing options and hedging.  A change of 50 basis points in interest rates in variable instruments would have an impact on the Group’s profit of   US$7 million (2022: a change of 100 basis points would impact profit by US$13 million), before the impact of taxation. This analysis assumes that all other factors remain constant, including foreign currency rates. (iii) Foreign currency exchange risk  Fortescue operates in Australia with a significant portion of its operating costs and capital expenditure incurred and paid in  Australian dollars and, as such, is exposed to the movements in the Australian dollar exchange rate. Fortescue’s risk management policy is to target specific levels at which to convert United States dollars to Australian dollars  by entering into either spot or short-term forward exchange contracts or structured foreign currency option arrangements  (i.e. collars) to fix a portion of the Group’s Australian dollar exposure to within a Board-approved range. The Group has not  applied hedge accounting to any of these contracts during the year.   ===== PAGE 131 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    129 Corporate governance Operating and   financial review Corporate directory Our approach to   sustainability Our approach to   climate change Directors' report    |  Remuneration Report  Financial report Overview Ore Reserves and  Mineral Resources Notes to the consolidated financial statements   For the year ended 30 June 2023 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 11 Financial risk management (continued) (a) Market risk (continued) (iii) Foreign currency exchange risk (continued) The carrying amounts of the financial assets and liabilities denominated in Australian dollars and Chinese Yuan (CNY)  (expressed in US dollars), are set out below: AUD denominated CNY denominated 2023  US$m 2022  US$m 2023  US$m 2022  US$m Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 945 1,506 436 218 Trade and other receivables 201 83 – – Other financial assets 72 10 – – Total financial assets 1,218 1,599 436 218 Financial liabilities Borrowings and lease liabilities 392 390 – – Trade and other payables 891 858 13 71 Current tax payable 304 284 – – Total financial liabilities 1,587 1,532 13 71 A change of two per cent in the Australian dollar exchange rate would have a net impact on the Group’s profit of US$7 million  (2022: a change of two per cent would have an impact of US$1 million), before the impact of taxation. A change of two per  cent in the Chinese Yuan exchange rate would have a net impact on the Group’s profit of US$8 million (2022: a change of two  per cent would have an impact of US$2 million), before the impact of taxation. This analysis assumes that all other variables,  including interest rates and iron ore price, remain constant. (b) Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to  Fortescue and is managed on a consolidated basis. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, deposits with banks,  and financial institutions and receivables from customers.  Contracts for iron ore sales allow for pricing mechanisms in which the price can be finalised over multiple periods. On this  basis, the Group does not consider in the first instance that the ageing of receivables is an indicator of risk of default, rather  an indication of the contractual terms and conditions agreed within the sales contract.  The Group’s exposure to customer credit risk for trade receivables other than iron ore trade receivables is influenced mainly  by the individual characteristics of each customer. Contracts for iron ore sales are completed under a Letter of Credit. New  customers are analysed individually for creditworthiness, taking into account credit ratings where available, previous trading  experience and other factors. In monitoring customer credit risk, customers are assessed individually by their debtor ageing  profile. Monitoring of receivable balances on an ongoing basis minimises the exposure to bad debts. Historically, bad debt  write-offs have been insignificant. At 30 June 2023, the Group had US$2 million (2022: US$4 million) of trade receivables which have not been settled within the  normal terms and conditions agreed with the customer. The Group applies a forward-looking expected credit loss model. To  measure the expected credit losses, these trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics.  Fortescue allocates each group of trade receivables to a credit risk grade based on data that is determined to be predictive  of the risk of loss including but not limited to external ratings and available press information about customers. Credit risk  grades are defined using qualitative and quantitative factors that are indicative of the risk of default and are aligned to  external credit rating definitions from agencies. The Group assesses expected credit losses by considering the risk of default  modified for credit enhancements such as letters of credit obtained. On this basis the resulting expected credit loss on trade  receivables is not material.  ===== PAGE 132 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    130 Financial report Notes to the consolidated financial statements   For the year ended 30 June 2023 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 11 Financial risk management (continued) (b) Credit risk (continued) Fortescue has not recognised any bad debt expense from trading counterparties in the years ended 30 June 2023 and 30 June  2022.  The exposure to the credit risk from cash and short-term deposits held in banks is managed by the Group’s treasury  department and monitored by the Metals CFO. Fortescue minimises the credit risks by holding funds with a range of financial  institutions with credit ratings approved by the Board. (c) Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due. Fortescue  manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and banking facilities, by continuously monitoring actual and  forecast cash flows and by matching the maturity profiles of its assets and liabilities.

It also recognises trade  receivables in relation to its provisionally priced iron ore sales contracts at fair value. All derivatives and provisionally priced  iron ore trade receivables are valued using valuation techniques which employ the use of market observable inputs, such  as foreign exchange spot and forward rates, yield curves of the respective currencies, interest rate curves and forward rate  curves of the underlying commodity. Accordingly, these instruments are classified as Level 2. Refer to note 10(a) for the fair  value of provisionally priced iron ore trade receivables as at 30 June 2023. For all fair value measurements and disclosures, the Group uses the following levels to categorise the method used:  Level 1: the fair value is calculated using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.  Level 2: the fair value is estimated using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the  asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices).  Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data. For financial instruments that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have  occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to  the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. There were no transfers between levels during  the year.

In considering impairment, assets are grouped together  based on their capability of producing independent cash inflows and are referred to as Cash Generating Units (CGUs).  Management has identified the Group has two CGUs; (i) Pilbara Operations comprising existing mining operations, inclusive  of Port and Rail; and (ii) Fortescue’s assets attributable to it's share of the Iron Bridge Unincorporated Joint Venture (Iron  Bridge CGU). The carrying amount of each CGU is compared to the CGU's recoverable amount with an impairment loss  recognised for the amount by which an assets’ carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. During the financial year, the cumulative effect of the events below occurred which management assessed as indicators of  impairment in relation to the Iron Bridge CGU: •	 An increase in the forecast production costs reflecting a combination of inflationary pressures consistent with that  experienced within the industry over the period; •	 Increase in discount rates reflecting the increase in the risk-free rate over the period; and •	 The extension of the project ramp up to name plate production volumes. Accordingly, an impairment assessment was completed for the Iron Bridge CGU. In assessing impairment, the Group is  required to determine the recoverable amount as the higher of the value in use, being the net present value of expected  future cashflows of the CGU in its current condition, and the fair value less cost of disposal (FVLCD). The Group has used the  FVLCD approach to assess the recoverable amount of the Iron Bridge CGU.  The FVLCD is based on discounted cashflows using market-based exchange rates, commodity prices, expected pricing  premiums, estimated quantities of recoverable resources, production levels, operating costs and capital requirements, and  the cost of its eventual disposal, based on CGU budgets and latest Life of Mine (LoM) plans. Where appropriate, the fair value  has included probability weighted scenarios in calculating inputs. These cash flows were discounted using a nominal post- tax discount rate that reflected current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU. Production outputs, recoverability of resources and operating and capital costs are based on both LoM plans and internal  budgets. Mine closure and rehabilitation is based on a combination of internal estimates on disturbance (based on LoM) and  independent experts' estimates on fixed infrastructure decommissioning.  The determination of FVLCD for the Iron Bridge CGU is considered to be Level 3 fair value measurements as they are derived  from valuation techniques that include inputs that are not based on observable market data. As a result of the recoverable  amount analysis, an impairment expense of US$1,037 million was recognised for the Iron Bridge CGU.   ===== PAGE 136 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    134 Financial report Notes to the consolidated financial statements   For the year ended 30 June 2023 KEY BALANCE SHEET ITEMS 12 Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (continued) (a) Property, plant and equipment (continued) The table below summarises the key assumptions for the Iron Bridge CGU FVLCD assessment and how they have been  determined: Price for Iron Bridge  product Published third-party forecast prices available for the 65% Fe Index are used as the basis for  future Iron Bridge product pricing, with a grade adjustment to 67% Fe, and incorporates an  additional long-term premium to reflect product value and increasing demand for energy  efficient magnetite product. The pricing is calculated using probability weighted scenarios  including any premiums expected. Operating cost Operating cost for the ramp up period is based on a Board approved budget. Upon reaching  nameplate capacity, the model estimates a life of mine operating cost excluding shipping and  State government royalties of approximately US$45/wmt (real) attributable to Fortescue (net of  fees for port and power services). Production output Board approved ramp up is assumed to be at nameplate capacity of 22mt (wet) for FY26. Production volumes are based on detailed life of mine plans factoring in current resources  and reserves, recoverable quantities of ore, environmental and heritage factors. Exchange rates  AUD/USD Long term exchange rate of 0.74 is derived with reference to analyst consensus which  involves market analysis including equity analyst estimates and internal management  estimates.  Discount rates In calculating FVLCD, a post-tax nominal discount rate of 9.5% was applied to the post tax  cash flows. The discount rate is impacted by the risk-free rate and other benchmark interest  rates. The discount rate takes into account both debt and equity. The cost of equity is  derived from the expected return on investment by the Group’s investors. The cost of debt is  based on its interest-bearing borrowings the Group is obliged to service. Segment-specific  risk is incorporated by applying individual beta factors. The beta factors are evaluated  annually based on publicly available market data. Summary of impairment: The carrying amount of the Iron Bridge CGU was US$3,468 million prior to impairment, the recoverable amount was  calculated to be US$2,431 million calculated on a FVLCD method. An impairment expense of US$1,037 million has been  recognised at 30 June 2023 reflecting the differences between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount. The post  tax impact of the impairment assessment was US$726 million. Sensitivity: The Iron Bridge CGU is highly sensitive to Iron Bridge product prices, changes in discount rate and foreign exchange rate and  changes in operating costs. Changes in the key assumptions will impact the recoverability of the CGU. Changes in production  ramp up cannot be quantified separately given the interrelationship of various assumptions.  Sensitivities are below: Sensitivity scenario Impact (US$m) US$5/dmt movement in Iron Bridge product price 568  0.5% change in discount rate 150 AUD 1 cent movement in the AUD to USD exchange rate 101 1% movement on operating costs 71  ===== PAGE 137 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    135 Corporate governance Operating and   financial review Corporate directory Our approach to   sustainability Our approach to   climate change Directors' report    |  Remuneration Report  Financial report Overview Ore Reserves and  Mineral Resources KEY BALANCE SHEET ITEMS 12 Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (continued) (b) Intangible assets Note Goodwill US$m Other  intangible assets  US$m Total  US$m Net carrying value At 1 July 2021 – 10 10 Additions – 30 30 Transfers – 54 54 Acquisition of a subsidiary 22 199 – 199 Amortisation – (36) (36) At 30 June 2022 199 58 257 Cost  199 239 438 Accumulated amortisation – (181) (181) Net carrying value At 1 July 2022 199 58 257 Transfers – 71 71 Additions – 25 25 Disposals – (14) (14) Adjustment to subsidiary purchase consideration 22 (4) – (4) Amortisation – (36) (36) At 30 June 2023 195 104 299 Cost  195 321 516 Accumulated amortisation – (217) (217) In considering impairment, the goodwill recognised from the acquisition of Fortescue WAE by Fortescue is allocated to the  CGUs expected to benefit from Fortescue WAE’s battery electric technology.

At the date of this  report, there is no present indication of the quantum of compensation sought in the proceedings. The Court has issued a  timetable for the proceedings which includes several hearings. The first hearing (for opening submissions and on-country  evidence) commenced in August 2023 and the final hearing (for closing submission) will be in October 2024. Fortescue remains open to negotiating a Land Access Agreement to the benefit of all Yindjibarndi people on similar terms to  the agreements it has in place with other native title groups in the region.  Fortescue had no material contingent assets or contingent liabilities at 30 June 2023 or at the date of this report.

(a) Principles of consolidation (i) Subsidiaries The consolidated financial statements incorporate the  financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries,  being the entities controlled by the Company. Control exists  when the Group is exposed to, or has right to, variable  returns from its involvement with the entity and has the  ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the  activities of the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for  the same reporting period as the Company, using consistent  accounting policies. All intercompany balances and  transactions, including unrealised profits and losses arising  from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated in full.  Subsidiaries are consolidated from the effective date of  acquisition to the effective date of disposal. The acquisition method of accounting is used to account  for the Group’s business combinations. Identifiable assets  acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination  are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair  values at the acquisition date.  Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and  included in administration expenses. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair  value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded  as goodwill. If those amounts are less than the fair value  of the net identifiable assets of the business acquired, the  difference is recognised directly in profit or loss as a bargain  purchase. Where settlement of any part of consideration is deferred,  the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their  present value as at the date of exchange. The discount rate  used is the entity’s incremental borrowing rate, being the  rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from  an independent financier under comparable terms and  conditions. Contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a  financial liability. Amounts classified as a financial liability are  subsequently remeasured to fair value with changes in fair  value recognised in profit or loss. Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of  subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated income  statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive  income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and  consolidated statement of financial position respectively. (ii) Associates Associates are all entities where the Group holds significant  influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in  the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee,  but is not control or joint control over those policies.  Associates are entities where the Group holds less than 20%  of the voting rights, but has determined that it has significant  influence over those entities due to the Group having  representation on the Board of directors and participation in  decisions over the relevant activities of those entities. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity  method of accounting (see (iv) below), after initially being  recognised at cost. (iii) Joint arrangements A joint arrangement is an arrangement when two or more  parties have joint control. Joint control exists when the parties  agree contractually to share control over the activities that  significantly affect the entity’s returns (relevant activities), and  the decisions about relevant activities require the unanimous  consent of the parties sharing joint control. Joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or  joint ventures, based on the contractual rights and obligations  between the parties to the arrangement. OTHER 24 Summary of significant accounting policies  ===== PAGE 153 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    151 Corporate governance Operating and   financial review Corporate directory Our approach to   sustainability Our approach to   climate change Directors' report    |  Remuneration Report  Financial report Overview Ore Reserves and  Mineral Resources (a) Principles of consolidation (continued) Joint operations If the contractual arrangement specifies a right to the  assets and the obligations for the liabilities for the parties,  the arrangement is classified as joint operation. The Group  recognises its direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenues  and expenses of joint operations and its share of any jointly  held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. These have been incorporated in the financial statements  under the appropriate headings. Details of the joint  operations are set out in note 23(b). To support operations and construction projects of some  of the joint operations, Fortescue and other parties to  the joint arrangements are required, from time to time, to  contribute funds in the form of cash calls, in proportion to  their respective interests in the joint arrangements. These  funds, if contributed by the parties to the joint arrangements  in different financial years, may give rise to deferred joint  venture contribution assets or liabilities. Joint ventures If the contractual arrangement grants the parties the right  to the arrangement’s net assets, it is classified as a joint  venture. Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using  the equity method, after initially being recognised at cost in  the consolidated statement of financial position. (iv) Equity method Under the equity method of accounting, the investments  are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to  recognise the Group’s share of the post-acquisition profits  or losses of the investee in profit or loss, and the Group’s  share of movements in other comprehensive income of  the investee in other comprehensive income. Dividends  received or receivable from associates and joint ventures  are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the  investment. Where the Group’s share of losses in an equity-accounted  investment equals or exceeds its interest in the entity,  including any other unsecured long-term receivables, the  Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has  incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the  other entity. Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its  associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of  the Group’s interest in these entities. Unrealised losses are  also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of  an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies  of equity-accounted investees have been changed where  necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted  by the Group. The carrying amount of equity-accounted investments  is tested for impairment in accordance with the policy  described in note 24(q). (b) Employee share trust The Group has formed a trust to administer its employee  share schemes. The trust is consolidated as the substance  of the relationship is that the trust is controlled by the Group.  Shares held by the share trust are disclosed as treasury  shares and deducted from contributed equity. (c) Foreign currency translation Transactions in foreign currencies have been converted  at rates of exchange at the date of those transactions.  Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign  currencies are translated at the rates of exchange of  the reporting date, with the resulting gains and losses  recognised in the income statement, except as set out  below: • 	 For qualifying cash flow hedges, the gains and losses  arising on foreign currency translations are deferred in  other comprehensive income. • 	 Translation differences on site rehabilitation provisions are  capitalised as part of the development assets.  • 	 Gains and losses on assets and liabilities carried at fair  value are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. Notes to the consolidated financial statements   For the year ended 30 June 2023 OTHER 24 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)  ===== PAGE 154 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    152 Financial report Notes to the consolidated financial statements   For the year ended 30 June 2023 OTHER 24 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) (d) Revenue recognition The Group is principally engaged in the business of  producing iron ore and providing related freight/shipping  services. Revenue is measured at the amount the Group  expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or  services and is recognised at the point at which control of  the goods or services is transferred to the customer. (i) Sale of products Revenue from the sale of products is recognised when  control has passed to the customer, no further work or  processing is required by the Group, the quantity and quality  of the products have been determined with reasonable  accuracy, the price can be reasonably estimated and  collectability is reasonably assured. The above conditions are generally satisfied when title  passes to the customer, typically on the bill of lading date  when iron ore is delivered to the vessel, or alternatively on  collection for port sales. Revenue is recorded at the invoiced amounts. However,  the shipping service represents a separate performance  obligation, and is recognised separately from the sale of iron  ore over the period during which the shipping service has  been provided, along with any associated shipping costs. Fortescue’s iron ore sales contracts, which also include  shipping services, may provide for provisional pricing of  sales at the time the product is delivered to the vessel with  final pricing determined using the relevant price indices on  or after the vessel’s arrival at the port of discharge. Under  AASB 9 the receivable asset is measured at fair value  through profit and loss. (ii) Services revenue Revenue from the provision of towage services is recognised  in the accounting period in which the services are rendered,  and revenue from manufacturing and engineering services  are recognised on a percentage of completion basis. (iii) Interest income Interest income is accrued using the effective interest rate  method. (e) Deferred income Deferred income represents payments collected but  not earned at the end of the reporting period. These  payments are recognised as revenue when the performance  obligations are satisfied. Where deferred income is considered to contain a financing  component and if the period of time between the receipt  of the upfront cash and the satisfaction of the future  performance obligations is greater than 1 year, an interest  charge of the upfront amount will be recognised. (f) Income tax The income tax expense for the year is the tax payable on  the current year’s taxable income based on the applicable  income tax rate for each jurisdiction. Income tax on the profit  or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the  taxation laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of  the reporting period in the countries where the Company’s  subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Current  income tax represents the expected tax payable on the  taxable income for the year and any adjustments to tax  payable in respect to previous years. Where the amount of tax payable or recoverable is  uncertain, a provision is established based on the Group’s  understanding of applicable tax law at the time. Settlement  of these matters may result in changes to current and  deferred income tax if the settlement differs from the  provision. Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability  method, on temporary differences arising between the tax  bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts  (subject to the Pillar Two disclosure exception noted below). However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if  it arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability  in a transaction, other than a business combination,  that at the time of the transaction affects neither the  accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income  tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been  enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date and  are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax  asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised for future deductible  temporary differences and carry forward of unused tax  losses only if it is probable that future taxable amounts  will be available to utilise those temporary differences and  losses. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting  date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer  probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.  ===== PAGE 155 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    153 Corporate governance Operating and   financial review Corporate directory Our approach to   sustainability Our approach to   climate change Directors' report    |  Remuneration Report  Financial report Overview Ore Reserves and  Mineral Resources Notes to the consolidated financial statements   For the year ended 30 June 2023 OTHER 24 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) (g) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, short-term  deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that  are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, and  are readily convertible to known amounts of cash. (h) Trade and other receivables Trade receivables other than iron ore sales receivables and  other receivables are recognised at amortised cost using the  effective interest method, less an allowance for impairment.  Trade receivables with embedded derivatives for provisional  pricing are measured at fair value through profit and loss  under AASB 9. The collectability of trade and other receivables is reviewed  on a monthly basis. Uncollectable amounts for iron ore sales  trade receivables are considered in the measurement of fair  value through the income statement under AASB 9. Trade  and other receivables that are measured at amortised cost  are determined using the expected credit loss model. Total  receivables which are known to be uncollectable are written  off by reducing the carrying amount directly. Significant  financial difficulties of the customer, probability that the  customer will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation  and default or delinquency in payments are considered  indicators that the receivable may not be collected. The  amount of the impairment allowance is the difference  between the receivable’s carrying amount and the present  value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the  original effective interest rate. Cash flows relating to  short-term receivables are not discounted if the effect of  discounting is immaterial. The amount of the impairment allowance is recognised in  the income statement within administration expenses. When  a receivable for which an impairment allowance had been  recognised becomes uncollectable in a subsequent period,  it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent  recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited  against other administration expenses. (i) Accrued income Accrued income primarily relates to the Group’s rights  to consideration for work performed but not billed at the  reporting date. The accrued income is transferred to trade  receivables in accordance with contractual terms with the  customer, when the rights have become unconditional.  Payments from customers are received based on a billing  schedule / milestone basis, as established in the contract. (f) Income tax (continued) Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is  a legal right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and  when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation  authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset  where the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset and  intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset  and settle the liability simultaneously. In a future year, the Group is expected to be subject to the  Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Pillar Two rules  which seek to ensure a 15% minimum tax rate is paid by large  multinational groups in each global jurisdiction in which  they operate. Although the Australian Government has  committed to implementing these rules for financial years  starting on or after 1 January 2024, the relevant legislation  has not yet been substantively enacted. In this regard,  the International Accounting Standards Board released  amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes relating to Pillar Two  in May 2023. Consistent with these amendments, in relation  to the current year, the Group has applied the mandatory  exception to recognising and disclosing information about  deferred tax assets and liabilities relating to Pillar Two  income taxes. Fortescue and its wholly owned Australian controlled entities  have implemented the tax consolidation legislation at 1  July 2002, namely the FMG tax consolidated group, and  are therefore taxed as a single entity from that date. FMG  Iron Bridge (Aust) Pty Ltd and its wholly owned Australian  controlled entities have implemented the tax consolidation  legislation as at 28 September 2011, namely the FMG Iron  Bridge tax consolidated group, and are therefore taxed as  a single entity from that date. On 1 July 2022, the FMG Iron  Bridge tax consolidated group merged with the FMG tax  consolidated group, and are therefore taxed as a single  entity from this date. The head entity and the controlled entities in the tax  consolidated group continue to account for their own  current and deferred tax amounts. These tax amounts are  measured as if each entity in the tax consolidated group  continues to be a standalone taxpayer in its own right. In addition to its own current and deferred tax amounts,  the head entity of the group also recognises the current  tax liabilities, or assets, and the deferred tax assets it has  assumed from unused tax losses and unused tax credits  from controlled entities in the tax consolidated group.  ===== PAGE 156 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    154 Financial report (i) Financial assets held at amortised cost The Group classifies its financial assets as held at amortised  cost only if the asset is held within a business model with  the objective to collect the contractual cash flows, and the  contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely  payments of principal and interest. The classification of  financial assets held at amortised cost applies to Fortescue’s  loans and receivables. These debt instruments are initially  measured at fair value and subsequently carried at  amortised cost. They are included in current assets, except  for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the  reporting date which are classified as non-current assets. At  the end of each reporting period, loans and receivables are  reviewed for impairment. (ii) Financial assets held at fair value through other  comprehensive income (FVOCI) The Group’s classification of financial assets held at fair  value through other comprehensive income applies  to equity investments where the Group has made the  irrevocable election to present the fair value gains or losses  on revaluation of the asset in other comprehensive income.  This election can be made for each investment; however, it  is not applicable to equity investments which are held for  trading. These assets are included in non-current assets  unless management intends to dispose of the investment  within 12 months of the reporting date. These instruments  are recognised at fair value, with changes in fair value being  recognised directly in other comprehensive income. (iii) Financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss  (FVPL) This category comprises trade receivables including the  quotation period for the sale of iron ore, derivatives (unless  designated as effective hedging instruments) and equity  investments which are held for trading or where the FVOCI  election has not been applied. They are carried on the  statement of financial position at fair value with changes  in fair value or dividend income recognised in profit or loss  with any associated changes in fair value recognised in the  income statement. The receivables relating to quotation  period for the sale of iron ore are recorded as trade  receivables. (i) Inventories Warehouse stores and materials, work in progress  and finished goods are stated at the lower of cost and  net realisable value. Cost for raw materials and stores  is determined as the purchase price. Cost of work in  progress comprises direct materials, direct labour and  an appropriate proportion of variable and fixed overhead  expenditure, the latter being allocated on the basis of  normal operating capacity. For partly processed and saleable iron ore, cost is based on  the weighted average cost method and includes: • Materials and production costs, directly attributable to the  extraction, processing and transportation of iron ore to  the existing location. • Production and transportation overheads. • Depreciation of property, plant and equipment used in the  extraction, processing and transportation of iron ore. Iron ore stockpiles represent iron ore that has been  extracted and is available for further processing or sale.  Quantities are assessed primarily through internal and third  party surveys. Where there is an indication that inventories  are obsolete or damaged, these inventories are written  down to net realisable value. Net realisable value is the  estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business  less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated  costs necessary to make the sale. Iron ore stockpiles classified as non-current assets reflect  stockpiles which are not expected to be utilised within the  next 12 months, with the net realisable value calculated on a  discounted cashflow basis. (j) Financial assets Fortescue classifies its financial assets into the following  categories: those to be measured subsequently at fair  value, being through either other comprehensive income  or through profit and loss, and those that are to be held at  amortised cost. The classification depends on the purpose for which the  financial assets were acquired. Management determines  the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. Notes to the consolidated financial statements   For the year ended 30 June 2023 OTHER 24 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)  ===== PAGE 157 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    155 Corporate governance Operating and   financial review Corporate directory Our approach to   sustainability Our approach to   climate change Directors' report    |  Remuneration Report  Financial report Overview Ore Reserves and  Mineral Resources Notes to the consolidated financial statements   For the year ended 30 June 2023 OTHER 24 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) (k) Financial liabilities (i) Trade payables Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value  and subsequently carried at amortised cost and represent  liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior  to the end of the financial year that are unpaid. (ii) Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the  consideration received, less directly attributable transaction  costs. After initial recognition, borrowings are subsequently  measured at amortised cost using the effective interest  method. Borrowings are derecognised when the contractual  obligations are discharged, cancelled or expire, or when  the terms of an existing borrowing are substantially  modified. Any difference between the carrying amount of a  derecognised liability and the carrying amount of the new  liability is recognised in the income statement. (l) Property, plant and equipment (i) Recognition and measurement Each class of property, plant and equipment is stated at  historical cost less, where applicable, any accumulated  depreciation and impairment loss. Historical cost includes  expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of  the assets. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of  materials and direct labour and any other costs directly  attributable to bringing an asset to a working condition  ready for its intended use. Assets under construction  are recognised in assets under development. Upon  commissioning, which is the date when the asset is in the  location and condition necessary for it to be capable of  operating in the manner intended by management, the  assets are transferred into property, plant and equipment or  development assets, as appropriate. Cost may also include transfers from equity of any gain or  loss on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency  purchases of property, plant and equipment. Borrowing  costs related to the acquisition or construction of qualifying  assets are capitalised. Costs required for dismantling and  rehabilitation are included in rehabilitation estimates.  Further information on rehabilitation is in note 24(p). When separate parts of an item of property, plant and  equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted  for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.  Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the  related equipment is capitalised as part of the equipment. Gains and losses arising on disposal of property, plant and  equipment are recognised in the income statement and  determined by comparing proceeds from the sale of the  assets to their carrying amount. (ii) Subsequent costs Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying  amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate,  only when it is probable that future economic benefits  associated with these subsequent costs will flow to  Fortescue and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.  Ongoing repairs and maintenance are recognised as an  expense in the income statement during the financial period  in which they are incurred. (iii) Depreciation Depreciation of assets, other than land which is not  depreciated, is calculated using the straight-line method  or units of production method, net of residual values, over  estimated useful lives. Depreciation commences on the  date when an asset is available for use, that is, when it is in  the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of  operating in the manner intended by management. Assets  acquired under leases are depreciated over the shorter of  the individual asset’s useful life and the lease term. Straight-line method Where the useful life is not linked to the quantities of iron ore  produced, assets are generally depreciated on a straight-line  basis. The estimated useful lives for the principal categories  of property, plant and equipment depreciated on a straight- line basis are as follows: •  Buildings 20 to 40 years •  Rolling stock 25 to 30 years •  Plant and equipment 2 to 20 years •  Rail and port infrastructure assets 40 to 50 years. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation  method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period  with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a  prospective basis. Units of production method Where the useful life of an asset is directly linked to the  extraction of iron ore from a mine, the asset is depreciated  using the units of production method. The units of production method is an amortised charge  proportional to the depletion of the estimated proven and  probable reserves at the mines.  ===== PAGE 158 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    156 Financial report Notes to the consolidated financial statements   For the year ended 30 June 2023 OTHER 24 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) (l) Property, plant and equipment (continued) (iv) Exploration and evaluation expenditure Exploration and evaluation activities involve the search for  mineral resources, the determination of technical feasibility  and the assessment of commercial viability of an identified  resource. Exploration and evaluation expenditure incurred is  accumulated and capitalised in respect of each identifiable  area of interest, and carried forward to the extent that: •  Rights to tenure of the identifiable area of interest are  current. • 	 At least one of the following conditions is also met: 	 (i) The expenditure is expected to be recouped through  the successful development of the identifiable area of  interest, alternatively by its sale; or 	 (ii) Where activities in the identifiable area of interest have  not, at the reporting date, reached a stage that permits  a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise  of economically recoverable reserves and activities in,  or in relation to, the area of interest, are continuing. Exploration and evaluation assets are reviewed at each  reporting date for indicators of impairment and tested for  impairment where such indicators exist. If the test indicates  that the carrying value might not be recoverable, the asset  is written down to its recoverable amount. These charges  are recognised within exploration, development and other  expenses in the income statement. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the  carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised  estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent  that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the  carrying amount that would have been determined had no  impairment loss been recognised for the asset in previous  years. Once the technical feasibility and commercial viability of  the extraction of mineral resources in an area of interest are  demonstrable, exploration and evaluation assets attributable  to that area of interest are first tested for impairment  and then reclassified from exploration and evaluation  expenditure to development expenditure. (v) Development expenditure Development expenditure includes capitalised exploration  and evaluation costs, pre-production development costs,  development studies and other expenditure pertaining  to that area of interest. Costs related to surface plant and  equipment and any associated land and buildings are  accounted for as property, plant and equipment. Development costs are accumulated in respect of  each separate area of interest. Costs associated with  commissioning new assets in the period before they  are capable of operating in the manner intended by  management are capitalised. Development costs incurred  after the commencement of production are capitalised  to the extent they are expected to give rise to a future  economic benefit. When an area of interest is abandoned or the Directors  decide that it is not commercially or technically feasible,  any accumulated cost in respect of that area is written off in  the financial period that the decision is made. Each area of  interest is reviewed at the end of each accounting period and  the accumulated costs written off to the income statement  to the extent that they will not be recoverable in the future. Amortisation of development costs capitalised is charged on  a unit of production basis over the life of estimated proven  and probable reserves at the mines. (m) Stripping costs (i) Development stripping costs Overburden and other mine waste materials are often  removed during the initial development of a mine in order  to access the mineral deposit. This activity is referred to as  development stripping and the directly attributable costs,  inclusive of an allocation of relevant overhead expenditure,  are capitalised as development costs. Capitalisation of development stripping costs ceases and  amortisation of those capitalised costs commences upon  commercial extraction of ore. Amortisation of capitalised development stripping costs is  determined on a unit of production basis for each area of  interest.  Development stripping costs are considered in combination  with other assets of an operation for the purpose of  undertaking impairment assessments.  ===== PAGE 159 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    157 Corporate governance Operating and   financial review Corporate directory Our approach to   sustainability Our approach to   climate change Directors' report    |  Remuneration Report  Financial report Overview Ore Reserves and  Mineral Resources Notes to the consolidated financial statements   For the year ended 30 June 2023 OTHER 24 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) (m) Stripping costs (continued) (ii) Production stripping costs Overburden and other mine waste materials continue to  be removed throughout the production phase of the mine.  This activity is referred to as production stripping, and  the associated costs charged to the income statement, as  operating cost, except when all three criteria below are met: • 	 Production stripping activity provides improved access to  the specific component of the ore body, and it is probable  that economic benefit arising from the improved access  will be realised in future periods. • 	 The Group can identify the component of the ore body for  which access has been improved. • 	 The costs relating to the production stripping activity  associated with that component can be measured reliably. If all of the above criteria are met, production stripping costs  resulting in improved access to the identified component of  the ore body are capitalised as part of development asset  and are amortised over the life of the component of the ore  body. The determination of components of the ore body is  individual for each mine. The allocation of costs between  production stripping activity and the costs of ore produced  is performed using relevant production measures, typically  strip ratios. Changes to the mine design, technical and economic  parameters affecting life of the components and strip ratios  are accounted for prospectively. (n) Intangible assets The Group capitalises amounts paid for the acquisition of  identifiable intangible assets, such as software, licenses,  trademarks and patents, where it is considered they will  contribute to future periods through revenue generation or  reductions in cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired  in a business combination are recognised at fair value at  the acquisition date. Following initial recognition, intangible  assets are carried at cost less amortisation and any  impairment losses. Intangible assets with finite lives are  amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives and  tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that  they may be impaired. The amortisation period and method  is reviewed at each financial year end. (i) Research and development costs Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development  expenditures on an individual project are recognised as an  intangible asset only when the Group can demonstrate all of  the following: • 	 The technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset  so that the asset will be available for use or sale. • 	 Its intention to complete and its ability and intention to use  or sell the asset. • 	 How the asset will generate future economic benefits • 	 The availability of resources to complete the asset. • 	 The ability to measure reliably the expenditure during  development. Following initial recognition of the development expenditure  as an asset, the asset is carried at cost less any accumulated  amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.  Amortisation of the asset begins when development is  complete and the asset is available for use. It is amortised  over the period of expected future benefit. Amortisation is  recorded in cost of sales. During the period of development,  the asset is tested for impairment annually. (ii) Goodwill Goodwill is measured as described in note 24(a)(i). Goodwill  on acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.  Goodwill is not amortised but it is tested for impairment  annually, or more frequently if events or changes in  circumstances indicate that it might be impaired, and is  carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.  Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the  purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to  those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating  units that are expected to benefit from the business  combination in which the goodwill arose.  ===== PAGE 160 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    158 Financial report Notes to the consolidated financial statements   For the year ended 30 June 2023 OTHER 24 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) (o) Leases The Group enters into contractual arrangements for the  leases of mining equipment, vehicles, buildings and other  assets. The nature of these arrangements can be lease  contracts or service contracts with embedded assets.  Typically, the duration of these contracts is for periods of  between two and five years, some of which include extension  options. Leases are recognised on the statement of financial position  as a right of use asset, representing the lessee’s entitlement  to the benefits of the identified asset over the lease term,  and a lease liability representing the lessee’s obligation to  make the lease payments. Each lease payment is allocated  between its liability and finance cost component. The  finance cost is charged to the income statement over the  lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of  interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each  period.  The right of use asset is amortised on a straight-line basis  over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and lease  term. When the right of use asset is used in the extraction,  processing and transportation of ore, depreciation is  included in inventory. Liabilities arising from contractual arrangements which  contain leases are initially measured at the present value  of the future lease payments. These payments include the  present value of fixed payments prescribed in the contract;  variable lease payments based on an index or prescribed  rate; amounts expected to be payable by the lessor under  residual value guarantees; and exercise price of a purchase  option if it is reasonably certain that the option will be  exercised. Right of use assets are initially measured at the amount of  the initial lease liability plus any lease payments at or before  commencement date less incentives received, plus any  initial direct costs, and any costs required for dismantling  and rehabilitation. Right of use assets are subsequently  measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and  accumulated impairment losses, and any adjustment for  remeasurement of the lease liability. Lease liabilities are  subsequently measured at present value, adjusted for any  variations to the underlying contract terms. Lease payments are discounted using the interest rate  implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be determined, the  Group’s incremental borrowing rate is used, which is the  rate which the Group would have to pay to borrow the funds  necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value in a similar  economic environment over a similar term and security. Payments for short-term leases and low value assets are  recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in the  income statement. Short-term leases are for a period of  12 months or less and contracts involving low value assets  typically comprise small items of IT hardware and minor  sundry assets. (p) Rehabilitation provision Provisions are recognised when Fortescue has a present  legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events.  It is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will  be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be  reliably estimated. The mining, extraction and processing activities of Fortescue  give rise to obligations for site rehabilitation. Rehabilitation  obligations include decommissioning of facilities, removal  or treatment of waste materials, land rehabilitation and site  restoration. The extent of work required and the associated costs  are estimated using current restoration standards and  techniques. Provisions for the cost of each rehabilitation  program are recognised at the time that environmental  disturbance occurs. Rehabilitation provisions are initially  measured at the expected value of future cash flows  required to rehabilitate the relevant site, discounted to their  present value using Australian Government bond market  yields that match, as closely as possible, the timing of  the estimated future cash outflows. The judgements and  estimates applied for the estimation of the rehabilitation  provisions are discussed in note 25(e). When provisions for closure and rehabilitation are initially  recognised, the corresponding cost is capitalised into the  cost of mine development assets, representing part of  the cost of acquiring the future economic benefits of the  operation. The capitalised cost of closure and rehabilitation  activities is recognised within development assets and is  amortised based on the units of production method over the  life of the mine. The value of the provision is progressively  increased over time as the effect of discounting unwinds,  creating an expense recognised in finance costs. At each reporting date, the rehabilitation liability is  remeasured to account for any new disturbance, updated  cost estimates, inflation, changes to the estimated reserves  and lives of operations, new regulatory requirements,  environmental policies and revised discount rates. Changes  to the rehabilitation liability are added to or deducted from  the related rehabilitation asset and amortised accordingly.  ===== PAGE 161 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    159 Corporate governance Operating and   financial review Corporate directory Our approach to   sustainability Our approach to   climate change Directors' report    |  Remuneration Report  Financial report Overview Ore Reserves and  Mineral Resources Notes to the consolidated financial statements   For the year ended 30 June 2023 OTHER 24 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) (q) Impairment of non-financial assets Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or  changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount  may not be recoverable. The Group conducts an internal  review of asset values bi-annually, which is used as a source  of information to assess for any indications of impairment.  External factors, such as changes in expected future prices,  costs and other market factors are also monitored to assess  for indications of impairment. If any such indication exists,  an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount is calculated,  being the higher of fair value less direct costs to sell and the  asset’s value in use. An impairment loss is recognised for the  amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its  recoverable amount. Fair value is determined as the amount that would be  obtained from the sale of the asset in an arm’s length  transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties.  Fair value for mineral assets is generally determined using  independent market assumptions to calculate the present  value of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise  from the continued use of the asset, including any expansion  prospects, and its eventual disposal. These cash flows are  discounted using an appropriate discount rate to arrive at a  net present value of the asset. Value in use is determined as the present value of the  estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the  continued use of the asset in its present form and its  eventual disposal, discounted using a pre-tax discount rate  that reflects current market assessments of the time value  of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the  estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. Value in use is determined by applying assumptions specific  to the Group’s continued use and does not take into account  future development.  In testing for indications of impairment and performing  impairment calculations, assets are considered as collective  groups and referred to as cash generating units. Cash  generating units are the smallest identifiable groups of  assets and liabilities that generate cash inflows that are  largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or  groups of assets. Impaired assets are reviewed at each reporting date whether  there is any indication that an impairment recognised in  prior periods may no longer exist or may have decreased. If  any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of that  asset is estimated and may result in a reversal of impairment  loss. The carrying amount of this asset is increased to its  revised recoverable amount, provided that this amount  does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been  determined had no impairment loss been recognised for  the asset in prior years. A reversal of impairment loss for an  asset is recognised in profit or loss. (r) Finance costs Finance costs principally represent interest expense and are  recognised as incurred except when associated with major  projects involving substantial development and construction  periods. In addition, finance costs include losses arising on  derecognition of finance liabilities at above their carrying  value, unwinding of the discount on provisions and bank  charges. Interest expense and other borrowing costs directly  attributable to major projects are added to the cost of the  project assets until such time as the assets are substantially  ready for their intended use or sale. Where funds are used  to finance an asset form part of general borrowings, the  amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average  of rates applicable to relevant general borrowings during the  construction period. Investment income earned on the temporary investment of  specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying  assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for  capitalisation. (s) Employee benefits (i) Wages and salaries and annual leave Liabilities for wages and salaries recognised in trade and  other payables, and non-monetary benefits and annual leave  recognised in provisions that are expected to be settled  within 12 months of the reporting date, are classified as  current liabilities in respect of employee services up to the  reporting date. They are measured at the amounts expected  to be paid when the liabilities are settled. (ii) Long service leave The liability for long service leave is recognised in provisions  and measured as the present value of expected future  payments to be made in respect of services provided by  employees up to the reporting date. Consideration is given  to expected future wage and salary levels, probability of  employee departures and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using market  yields at the reporting date on Australian Government bonds  with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely  as possible, the estimated future cash outflows. The liability  for long service leave for which settlement within 12 months  of the reporting date cannot be deferred is recognised in  the current provision. The liability for long service leave  for which settlement can be deferred beyond 12 months  from the reporting date is recognised in the non-current  provision.  ===== PAGE 162 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    160 Financial report Notes to the consolidated financial statements   For the year ended 30 June 2023 OTHER 24 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) (t) Share-based payments Share-based remuneration benefits are provided to  employees under Fortescue’s share rights plan, as set out in  note 18. The fair value of rights is measured at grant date and is  recognised as an employee benefits expense over the  period during which the employees become unconditionally  entitled to the rights, with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value at grant date is determined using an option  pricing model that takes into account the exercise price,  the term of the right, the impact of dilution, the share price  at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying  share, the effect of additional market conditions, the  expected dividend yield and the risk free interest rate for the  term of the right.  The fair value of the rights granted is measured to reflect  expected market vesting conditions, but excludes the  impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example,  profitability). Non-market vesting conditions are included  in assumptions about the number of rights that are  expected to become exercisable. At each reporting date,  the entity revises its estimate of the number of rights that  are expected to become exercisable. The employee benefit  expense recognised each period takes into account the  most recent estimate. The impact of the revision to original  estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement with  a corresponding adjustment to equity. (u) Dividends Provision is made for the amount of any dividend declared,  being appropriately authorised and no longer at the  discretion of the Company, on or before the end of the  reporting period but not distributed at the end of the  reporting period. (v) Earnings per share (i) Basic earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net profit  after tax attributable to the ordinary shareholders by the  weighted average number of ordinary shares on issue during  the financial year. (ii) Diluted earnings per share Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net  profit after tax attributable to the ordinary shareholders by  the weighted average number of ordinary shares on issue  during the financial year, after adjusting for the effects of  all potential dilutive ordinary shares that were outstanding  during the financial year. (w) Goods and Services Tax (GST) and other taxes on  consumption Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the  amount of associated consumptive tax, except where the  amount of consumptive tax incurred is not recoverable  from the taxation authority. In these circumstances the  consumptive tax is recognised as part of the cost of  acquisition of the asset or as part of an item of the expense.  Receivables and payables in the statement of financial  position are shown inclusive of consumptive tax. The net  amount of consumptive tax recoverable from, or payable  to, the taxation authority is included as a current asset or  liability in the statement of financial position. Cash flows are presented in the cash flow statement on a  gross basis, except for the consumptive tax component of  investing and financing activities, which is disclosed as an  operating cash flow. (x) Derivative financial instruments From time to time, the Group holds derivative financial  instruments to hedge its foreign currency and commodity  price risk exposures. Derivatives are initially measured at  fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are  measured at fair value, and changes therein are generally  recognised in profit or loss. (y) Government grants Grants from the government are recognised at their fair  value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant  will be received and the Group will comply with all attached  conditions. Government grants relating to costs are deferred  and recognised in profit or loss as other income over the  period necessary to match them with the costs that they  are intended to compensate. Government grants relating to  the purchase of property, plant and equipment are included  in non-current liabilities as deferred income and they are  credited to profit or loss as other income on a straight-line  basis over the expected lives of the related assets.

The amendments also confirm that contingent assets  should not be recognised at the acquisition date.  • AASB 116 Property, Plant and Equipment (PP&E) – prohibits an entity from deducting from  the cost of an item of PP&E any proceeds received from selling items produced while the  entity is preparing the asset for its intended use. It also clarifies that an entity is ‘testing  whether the asset is functioning properly’ when it assesses the technical and physical  performance of the asset. The financial performance of the asset is not relevant to this  assessment. Entities must disclose separately the amounts of proceeds and costs relating to  items produced that are not an output of the entity’s ordinary activities.  •  AASB 137 – clarifies that the direct costs of fulfilling a contract include both the incremental  costs of fulfilling the contract and an allocation of other costs directly related to fulfilling  contracts. Before recognising a separate provision for an onerous contract, the entity  recognises any impairment loss that has occurred on assets used in fulfilling the contract.  These amendments had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.  ===== PAGE 164 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    162 Financial report Notes to the consolidated financial statements   For the year ended 30 June 2023 OTHER 24 Summary of significant accounting policies (continued) (aa) New accounting standards and interpretations (continued) (ii) New accounting standards and interpretations not yet adopted Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for the 30 June 2023  reporting period. Those that are applicable to Fortescue, and which may have an effect on the Group’s accounting policies,  financial position or performance are disclosed below. These standards and interpretations have not been early adopted. Accounting standard Description of change Application date AASB 2020-1  Amendments to  Australian Accounting  Standards–Classification  of Liabilities as Current or  Non-current This amendment to AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements  clarifies the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or   non-current. They must be applied retrospectively in accordance with  the normal requirements in AASB 108 Accounting Policies, Changes in  Accounting Estimates and Errors. Standard: 1  January 2024 Group: 1 July  2024 AASB 2021-2  Amendments to  Australian Accounting  Standards–Disclosure of  Accounting Policies and  Definition of Accounting  Estimates The AASB amended AASB 101 to require entities to disclose their material  rather than their significant accounting policies. The amendments define  what is ‘material accounting policy information’ and explain how to identify  when accounting policy information is material. They further clarify that  immaterial accounting policy information does not need to be disclosed.  If it is disclosed, it should not obscure material accounting information.   To support this amendment, the AASB also amended AASB Practice  Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements to provide guidance on how  to apply the concept of materiality to accounting policy disclosures.   The amendment to AASB 108 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting  Estimates and Errors clarifies how companies should distinguish  changes in accounting policies from changes in accounting estimates.  The distinction is important, because changes in accounting estimates  are applied prospectively to future transactions and other future  events, whereas changes in accounting policies are generally applied  retrospectively to past transactions and other past events as well as the  current period.  Standard: 1  January 2023 Group: 1 July  2023 AASB 2014-10   Amendments to  Australian Accounting  Standards: Sale or  Contribution of Assets  Between an Investor and  its Associate or Joint  Venture  The AASB has made limited scope amendments to AASB 10 Consolidated  Financial Statements and AASB 128 Investments in Associates and Joint  Ventures. The amendments clarify the accounting treatment for sales  or contribution of assets between an investor and their associates or  joint ventures. They confirm that the accounting treatment depends on  whether the non-monetary assets sold or contributed to an associate  or joint venture constitute a ‘business’ (as defined in AASB 3 Business  Combinations).  Standard: 1  January 2023 Group: 1 July  2023 AASB 2015-10  Amendments to  Australian Accounting  Standards – Effective  Date of Amendments to  AASB 10 and AASB 128  Where the non-monetary assets constitute a business, the investor will  recognise the full gain or loss on the sale or contribution of assets. If the  assets do not meet the definition of a business, the gain or loss is recognised  by the investor only to the extent of the other investor’s interests in the  associate or joint venture. The amendments apply prospectively.  Standard: 1  January 2025 Group: 1 July  2025 AASB 2017-5 and AASB  2021 -7 Amendments to  Australian Accounting  Standards – Effective  Date of Amendments to  AASB 10 and AASB 128  and Editorial Corrections  ===== PAGE 165 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    163 Corporate governance Operating and   financial review Corporate directory Our approach to   sustainability Our approach to   climate change Directors' report    |  Remuneration Report  Financial report Overview Ore Reserves and  Mineral Resources Notes to the consolidated financial statements   For the year ended 30 June 2023 OTHER 25  Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of the consolidated financial statements  requires management to make judgements and estimates  and form assumptions that affect how certain assets,  liabilities, revenue, expenses and equity are reported.  At each reporting period, management evaluates its  judgements and estimates based on historical experience  and on other factors it believes to be reasonable under the  circumstances, the results of which form the basis of the  carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily  apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from  these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. Fortescue has identified the following critical accounting  policies where significant judgements and estimates are  made by management in the preparation of these financial  statements. (a) Iron ore reserve estimates Iron ore reserves are estimates of the amount of product that  can be economically and legally extracted from Fortescue’s  current mining tenements. In order to calculate ore reserves,  estimates and assumptions are required about a range  of geological, technical and economic factors, including  quantities, grades, production techniques, recovery rates,  production costs, transport costs, commodity demand,  commodity prices and exchange rates. Estimating the  quantity and grade of ore reserves requires the size, shape  and depth of ore bodies or fields to be determined by  analysing geological data such as drilling samples. This  requires complex and difficult geological judgements and  calculations to interpret the data. As economic assumptions used to estimate reserves change  and as additional geological data is generated during the  course of operations, estimates of reserves may vary from  period to period. Changes in reported reserves may affect  Fortescue’s financial results and financial position in a  number of ways, including the following: • 	 Asset carrying values may be affected due to changes in  estimated future cash flows. • 	 Depreciation and amortisation charges in the income  statement may change where such charges are  determined by the units of production method, or where  the useful economic lives of assets change. • 	 The carrying value of deferred tax assets may change  due to changes in estimates of the likely recovery of tax  benefits. (b) Exploration and evaluation expenditure -  recoverable amount Fortescue’s accounting policy for exploration and  evaluation expenditure results in expenditure being  capitalised for an area of interest where it is considered  likely to be recoverable by future exploitation or sale  or where the activities have not reached a stage which  permits a reasonable assessment of the existence of  reserves. This policy requires management to make  certain estimates as to future events and circumstances,  in particular whether an economically viable extraction  operation can be established. Any such estimates and  assumptions may change as new information becomes  available. If, after having capitalised the expenditure  under the policy, a judgement is made that recovery of the  expenditure is unlikely, the relevant capitalised amount will  be written off to the income statement. (c) Development expenditure - recoverable amount Development activities commence after commercial  viability and technical feasibility of the project is  established. Judgement is applied by management  in determining when a project is commercially viable  and technically feasible. In exercising this judgement,  management is required to make certain estimates  and assumptions as to future events. If, after having  commenced the development activity, a judgement is  made that a development asset is impaired, the relevant  capitalised amount will be written off to the income  statement.  ===== PAGE 166 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    164 Financial report Notes to the consolidated financial statements   For the year ended 30 June 2023 OTHER 25  Critical accounting estimates and judgements (continued) (d) Property, plant and equipment – recoverable  amount The determination of FVLCD and value in use requires  management to make estimates about expected production  and sales volumes, commodity prices, reserves (see ‘iron  ore reserve estimates’ above), operating costs, rehabilitation  costs and future capital expenditure. Management also  considers the impact of material climate-related risks,  both transitional and physical, on estimates of future costs  and useful lives of assets. Changes in circumstances may  alter these projections, which may impact the recoverable  amount of the assets. In such circumstances, some or all of  the carrying value of the assets may be impaired and the  impairment would be charged to the income statement. (i) Iron Bridge CGU – recoverable amount The Group has used the FVLCD approach to assess the  recoverable amount of the Iron Bridge CGU (refer to note  12(a)). The FVLCD is based on discounted cashflows using  market-based exchange rates, commodity prices, expected  pricing premiums, estimated quantities of recoverable  resources, production levels, operating costs and capital  requirements, and the cost of its eventual disposal, based  on CGU budgets and latest Life of Mine (LoM) plans. Where  appropriate, the fair value has included probability weighted  scenarios in calculating inputs. These cash flows were  discounted using a nominal post-tax discount rate that  reflected current market assessments of the time value of  money and the risks specific to the CGU. Production outputs, recoverability of resources and  operating and capital costs are based on both LoM plans  and internal budgets. Mine closure and rehabilitation is  based on a combination of internal estimates on disturbance  (based on LoM) and independent experts estimates on fixed  infrastructure decommissioning.  (e) Rehabilitation estimates Fortescue’s accounting policy for the recognition of  rehabilitation provisions requires significant estimates  including the magnitude of possible works required for the  removal of infrastructure and of rehabilitation works, future  cost of performing the work, the inflation and discount rates  and the timing of cash flows. These uncertainties may result  in future actual expenditure differing from the amounts  currently provided. (f) Revenue (i) Revenue from iron ore sales The transaction price at the date control passes for sales  made subject to the provisional pricing mechanism is  estimated with reference to quoted index prices. For sales  where the final settlement price is yet to be determined,  the value of this revenue is adjusted by considering tonnes  subject to price finalisation at the end of the period and  applying the closing spot rate. (ii) Revenue from engineering services Revenue from engineering services is recognised over time,  as the services are provided to the customer, based on costs  incurred for work performed to date as a percentage of total  estimated costs under the contract or amounts billed as a  percentage of the contract value. Judgements made that could  have a significant effect on the financial report and estimates  with a risk of adjustment in the next year are as follows: • Determination of stage of completion • Estimation of total contract revenue and contract costs • Estimation of project completion date. (g) Joint arrangements Judgement is required to determine when the Group has  joint control, which requires an assessment of the relevant  activities and when the decisions in relation to those activities  require unanimous consent. The Group has determined that  the relevant activities for its joint arrangements relate to the  operating and capital decisions of the arrangement, such  as the approval of the capital expenditure program for each  year. The considerations made in determining joint control  are similar to those necessary to determine control over  subsidiaries (refer to note 24(a)).  Judgement is also required to classify a joint arrangement  as either a joint operation or joint venture. Classifying the  arrangement requires the Group to assess its rights and  obligations arising from the arrangement. Specifically, it  considers: •	 The structure of the joint arrangement – whether it is  structured through a separate vehicle •	 When the arrangement is structured through a separate  vehicle, the Group also considers the rights and obligations  arising from: 	 -  the legal form of the separate vehicle 	 -  the terms of the contractual arrangement  	 -  other facts and circumstances (when relevant). This assessment often requires significant judgement, and  a different conclusion on joint control, and also whether  the arrangement is a joint operation or joint venture, may  materially impact the accounting. (h) Fair value measurement of financial assets When the fair values of financial assets recorded in the  statement of financial position cannot be measured based on  quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured  using valuation techniques including the discounted cash flow  model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable  markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a  degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values.  Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity  risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions relating  to these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial  instruments.  ===== PAGE 167 ===== DR ANDREW FORREST AO In the Directors’ opinion:  (a)  the financial statements and notes set out on pages 109 to 164 are in accordance with  the Corporations Act 2001, including:  	   (i)  complying with Accounting Standards, the Corporations Regulations 2001 and other  mandatory professional reporting requirements, and 	   (ii)  giving a true and fair view of the consolidated entity’s financial position at 30 June  2023 and of its performance for the year ended on that date, and (b)  there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Company will be able to pay its debts  as and when they become due and payable, and (c)  at the date of this declaration, there are reasonable grounds to believe that the members  of the extended closed group identified in note 20 will be able to meet any obligations or  liabilities to which they are, or may become, subject to and by virtue of the deed of cross  guarantee described in note 20.

What we have audited The Group financial report comprises: •	 the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2023 •	 the consolidated income statement for the year then ended •	 the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended •	 the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended •	 the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended •	 the notes to the consolidated financial statements, which include significant accounting policies and other explanatory  information •	 the directors’ declaration. Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under those standards are  further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial report section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Independence We are independent of the Group in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act  2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional & Ethical Standards Board’s APES 110 Code of Ethics for  Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the financial report  in Australia. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.  ===== PAGE 170 ===== Audit scope Key audit  matters Materiality Independent auditor’s report    For the year ended 30 June 2023   Materiality •	 For the purpose of our audit we used overall Group materiality of US$495 million, which represents approximately 5% of  the Group’s weighted average profit before tax for the current and previous two years, adjusting for infrequently occurring  items, including impairment expense recognised in the current year. •	 We applied this threshold, together with qualitative considerations, to determine the scope of our audit and the nature,  timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements on the financial report as a whole. •	 We chose adjusted Group profit before tax because, in our view, it is the benchmark against which the performance of  the Group is most commonly measured. We applied a three year weighted average to address potential volatility in the  calculation of materiality that arises from iron ore price fluctuations between years. •	 We utilised a 5% threshold based on our professional judgement, noting it is within the range of commonly acceptable  thresholds.    Audit Scope •	 Our audit focused on where the Group made subjective judgements; for example, significant accounting estimates  involving assumptions and inherently uncertain future events. •	 The primary activity of the Group is the operation of integrated iron ore mining operations and infrastructure comprising  various iron ore mines in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, a rail network and port facilities in Port Hedland.  Additionally, the Group is developing and acquiring green energy technologies and projects through the activities of the  Fortescue Energy operating segment. Our audit procedures were predominantly performed in Perth, where many of the  Corporate and Group Operations functions are centralised. This was supported by visits to Fortescue’s mining operations.   Our audit approach An audit is designed to provide reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement.  Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could  reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial report. We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial  report as a whole, taking into account the geographic and management structure of the Group, its accounting processes  and controls and the industry in which it operates. FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    168  ===== PAGE 171 ===== Independent auditor’s report    For the year ended 30 June 2023 FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    169 Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial  report for the current period. The key audit matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole,  and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Further, any commentary on  the outcomes of a particular audit procedure is made in that context. We communicated the key audit matters to the Audit, Risk  Management and Sustainability Committee. Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Impairment assessment of the Iron Bridge Cash Generating Unit (CGU) Refer to note 12 and 25(d) In accordance with Australian Accounting Standards  and internal policies, Fortescue is required to assess at  each reporting date whether there is any indication that  its assets may be impaired. During the financial year, it  was determined that indicators of impairment existed  in relation to their Iron Bridge CGU. Accordingly, an  impairment assessment was completed which resulted  in an impairment expense of US$1,037 million being  recognised in other expenses.  The recoverable amount of the CGU was determined  using the higher of value in use (being the net present  value of expected future cash flows of the CGU in  its current condition) and the fair value less cost of  disposal (‘Fair Value’). The Group has used the Fair Value  methodology. The Group prepared a discounted cash flow model in  determining the recoverable amount of the CGU which  involved the estimation of several assumptions as  described in note 25(d). The impairment assessment of the Iron Bridge CGU was a  key audit matter given the significance of the CGU assets  to the consolidated statement of financial position and the  level of judgement involved in forming the estimates used  in determining the recoverable amount and whether an  impairment is required. We performed the following audit procedures, amongst  others, over the impairment assessment of the Iron Bridge  CGU: •	 We developed our understanding of the process by which  the cash flow forecasts were prepared to assess the  recoverable amount of the CGU. •	 We have assessed the mathematical accuracy and logic  of the discounted cash flow model and have assessed  whether the methodology utilised to determine the  recoverable amount was consistent with Australian  Accounting Standards. •	 We have assessed the reasonableness of the CGU by  determining whether the included assets, liabilities and  cash flows are directly attributable to the CGU, and in  line with our knowledge of the Group’s operations and in  accordance with Australian Accounting Standards. •	 We have evaluated the Group’s historical ability to  forecast future cash flows by comparing budgets with  reported actual results for the past year. •	 We assessed the appropriateness of the significant  assumptions used, including assessing: -	 The forecasted product price assumptions, by  comparing them to analysis performed by external  parties, and comparing them to economic and industry  forecasts  -	 Whether the operating cost forecasts are consistent  with the most up-to-date budgets and life of mine; and -	 The discount rate used, by assessing the cost of capital  for the Group, assisted by PwC valuations experts,  and comparing the rate to market data and industry  research. •	 We have assessed the reasonableness of the disclosures  made in the financial report against the requirements of  Australian Accounting Standards.    ===== PAGE 172 ===== Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter Operating sales revenue – iron ore and shipping revenue Refer to note 3 and 25(f)  The Group recognised iron ore revenue of US$15,318  million and shipping revenue of US$1,356 million for the  year ended 30 June 2023. Fortescue’s sales contracts may be provisionally priced  at the initial revenue recognition (bill of lading) date, with  the final settlement price based on a pre-determined  quotation period. Operating sales revenue from these  contracts each comprise two parts: (i)  Iron ore revenue and shipping revenue recognised at  the bill of lading date at current prices; and (ii) Provisional pricing adjustments which represent any  difference between the revenue recognised at the bill  of lading date and the final settlement price. This is a key audit matter given the significance of iron  ore and shipping revenue to the consolidated income  statement. These factors combine to make this area a key  audit matter. We performed the following audit procedures, amongst  others, over iron ore and shipping revenue: •	 We performed tests on a sample basis of IT systems  and key controls involved in the calculation of iron ore  and shipping revenue, including provisional pricing  adjustments to revenue. •	 We performed analytical procedures over iron ore  and shipping revenue, including provisional pricing  adjustments. We compared revenue recognised with  relevant external price indices and external data over  Fortescue’s shipped tonnes. •	 For a sample of sales contracts open at balance date, we  inspected the sales contracts and assessed key terms of  the sale including the volume of sales and duration of any  quotation period. •	 Compared journal entries to supporting documentation  for a selection based on risk, including those posted at  period-end which impact iron ore and shipping revenue. •	 For a sample of sales contracts with provisional pricing  adjustments recorded during the year, we confirmed that  the provisional pricing adjustments were appropriately  presented within the financial statements by reconciling  the separately recorded amounts to invoices. Restoration and rehabilitation obligations Refer to note 13 and 25(e) The Group recognised provisions for restoration and  rehabilitation obligations of US$1,063 million as at 30 June  2023.  This is a key audit matter as the calculation of these  provisions requires judgement by the Group in estimating  the magnitude of possible works required for the removal of  infrastructure and rehabilitation activities, the future cost of  performing the work, when rehabilitation activities will take  place, and the economic assumptions such as inflation and  discount rates applied to future liabilities.  The judgement required by the Group to estimate such  costs is made in circumstances where there has been  limited restoration and rehabilitation activity or historical  precedent against which to benchmark estimates of future  costs. These factors combine to make this area a key audit  matter.  To assess the Group’s restoration and rehabilitation  obligations, we performed the following audit procedures,  amongst others:  •	 Developed an understanding of how the Group identified  the relevant methods, assumptions, and sources of data,  that are appropriate for developing the closure plans and  associated cost estimates in the context of the Australian  Accounting Standards.  •	 Developed an understanding of the relevant control  activities associated with developing the closure plans  and associated cost estimates.  •	 We checked the mathematical accuracy of calculations  underlying the rehabilitation obligations on a sample  basis, and whether the timing of cash flows within the  calculations were consistent with latest life of mine plans. •	 Assessed whether the discount rates used in the  rehabilitation calculations were reasonable by comparing  them to market data. •	 Compared significant assumptions used in the closure  plans and associated cost estimates to other similar costs  in the business or external data where appropriate. •	 We assessed provision movements in the year relating  to restoration and rehabilitation obligations to determine  whether they were consistent with our understanding  of the Group’s operations and associated rehabilitation  plans.

We have issued a separate opinion on the  remuneration report and a limited assurance conclusion on the Green Bond Eligible Project allocation included in pages 43 to  44 of the operating and financial review section of the annual report. In connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider  whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or  otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report, we  conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to  report in this regard. Responsibilities of the directors for the financial report The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in  accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal control as the directors  determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material  misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group to continue as a going  concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless  the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial report Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material  misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance  is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing  Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are  considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions  of users taken on the basis of the financial report.

Subject Matter Information and Criteria We assessed the Subject Matter Information against the Criteria. The Subject Matter Information needs to be read and  understood together with the Criteria. The Subject Matter Information is set out in the table below. Table 1 – Subject Matter Information Eligible Project Eligible Category Cumulative Spend as   at 30 June 2023 US$m Fortescue WAE battery systems Energy storage 205 Pilbara Generation Project Renewable energy 76 Pilbara Transmission Project Renewable energy 60 Green Fleet Energy Hub Clean transportation 58 Battery Electric Locomotives Clean transportation 15 Total allocated 414 The Criteria used by Fortescue Metals Group Ltd to prepare the Subject Matter Information is the basis of preparation set out  on pages 43 to 44 of the Operating and financial review in the Fortescue FY23 Annual Report (the ‘Criteria’). The maintenance and integrity of Fortescue Metals Group Ltd’s website is the responsibility of the Group’s management; the  work carried out by us does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, we accept no responsibility for any  changes that may have occurred to the reported Subject Matter Information or Criteria when presented on Fortescue Metals  Group Ltd’s website. Our assurance conclusion is with respect to the Subject Matter Information as at 30 June 2023, and does not extend to any  other information included in, or linked from, the Fortescue FY23 Annual Report including any images, audio files or videos. Responsibilities of Management The Group’s management is responsible for the preparation of the Subject Matter Information in accordance with the  Criteria. This responsibility includes:  •	 determining appropriate reporting topics and selecting or establishing suitable criteria for measuring, evaluating and  preparing the underlying Subject Matter Information;  •	 ensuring that those criteria are relevant and appropriate to Fortescue Metals Group Ltd and the intended users; and •	 designing, implementing and maintaining systems, processes and internal controls over information relevant to the  evaluation or measurement of the Subject Matter Information, which is free from material misstatement, whether due to  fraud or error, against the Criteria. Our independence and quality control We have complied with the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standard Board’s APES 110 Code  of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) relevant to assurance engagements, which  are founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and  professional behaviour. Our firm applies Australian Standard on Quality Management ASQM 1, Quality Management for Firms that Perform Audits  or Reviews of Financial Reports and Other Financial Information, or Other Assurance or Related Services Engagements,  which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures  regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

Our engagement has been conducted in accordance with the Australian Standard on Assurance Engagements (ASAE 3000)  Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information. That standard requires that we plan  and perform this engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether anything has come to our attention to indicate that the  Subject Matter Information has not been prepared as at 30 June 2023, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for,  a reasonable assurance engagement and consequently the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement  is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been  performed. Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion. In carrying out our limited assurance engagement we: •	 made inquiries of the persons responsible for the Subject Matter Information; •	 obtained an understanding of the process for collecting and reporting the Subject Matter Information and obtaining  supporting evidence to assess the eligibility of the project against the Group’s Sustainability Financing Framework (as  announced on 9 November 2021); •	 obtained supporting evidence to assess the allocation of green bonds proceeds to eligible projects; •	 performed limited substantive testing on a selective basis of the Subject Matter Information to assess that data had been  appropriately measured, recorded, collated and reported; and •	 considered the disclosure and presentation of the Subject Matter Information. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion. Inherent limitations Inherent limitations exist in all assurance engagements due to the selective testing of the information being examined. It is  therefore possible that fraud, error or non-compliance may occur and not be detected. A limited assurance engagement is not  designed to detect all instances of non-compliance of the Subject Matter Information with the Criteria, as it is limited primarily to  making enquiries of the Group’s management and applying analytical procedures. Additionally, non-financial data may be subject to more inherent limitations than financial data, given both its nature and the  methods used for determining, calculating and estimating such data. The precision of different measurement techniques may  also vary. The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial  information allows for different, but acceptable, evaluation and measurement techniques that can affect comparability between  entities and over time. The limited assurance conclusion expressed in this report has been formed on the above basis. Our limited assurance conclusion Based on the procedures we have performed, as described under ‘Our responsibilities’ and the evidence we have obtained,  nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Subject Matter Information as at 30 June 2023, has not been  prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria. Use and distribution of our report We were engaged by the board of directors of Fortescue Metals Group Ltd to prepare this independent assurance report having  regard to the criteria specified by the Group and set out in the basis of preparation set out on pages 43 to 44 of the Operating  and financial review in the Fortescue FY23 Annual Report. This report was prepared solely for Fortescue Metals Group Ltd  to assist the directors in responding to their governance responsibilities by obtaining an independent assurance report in  connection with the Subject Matter Information. We accept no duty, responsibility or liability to anyone other than Fortescue Metals Group Ltd in connection with this report or  to Fortescue Metals Group Ltd for the consequences of using or relying on it for a purpose other than that referred to above. We  make no representation concerning the appropriateness of this report for anyone other than Fortescue Metals Group Ltd and if  anyone other than Fortescue Metals Group Ltd chooses to use or rely on it they do so at their own risk. This disclaimer applies to the maximum extent permitted by law and, without limitation, to liability arising in negligence or under  statute and even if we consent to anyone other than Fortescue Metals Group Ltd receiving or using this report.

Chichester Hub Fortescue’s mining hub with two  operating iron ore mines, Cloudbreak  and Christmas Creek. CID Channel Iron Deposit. CO2-eq	 Not all greenhouse gases warm the  atmosphere equally. Some gases have  a greater global warming potential, or  warming effect, than carbon dioxide.  To account for this, the term CO2-eq  is used and means that greenhouse  gases other than carbon dioxide have  been converted to the equivalent  amount of CO2. This provides for a  single, uniform means of measuring  emissions reductions for multiple  greenhouse gases.

Green ammonia,  in contrast, 100 per cent renewable.  One way to make green ammonia is  via the Haber Bosch process. Green  hydrogen and nitrogen that has been  extracted from the air are reacted  together during a process powered by  renewable electricity to produce green  ammonia, or NH3.  Green hydrogen Green hydrogen is hydrogen produced  via electrolysis of water. Electrolysis  splits the water molecule into its  constituents, hydrogen and oxygen.  The process must be powered by  renewable electricity for the hydrogen  to be defined as green. Green iron Iron ore that has been converted  into iron (a) without the use of coal  or any other fossil fuel and (b) using  renewable electricity and, in some  cases, green hydrogen. Green iron ore Iron ore that has been mined without  the use of fossil fuels, i.e. using haul  trucks and other equipment that runs  on battery-electric or green hydrogen  based technologies.  Green metals Metals mined using renewable energy.  Critical minerals are not inherently green  unless they are mined in this way. Green metallic iron Metallic iron made through the reduction  of iron ore using 100% renewable energy  and no fossil fuels. Green shipping fuels Shipping fuels made without using fossil  fuels, such as green ammonia. Green steel Steel made using green iron, powered by  100% renewable energy.  Ha	 Hectares.

Indicated Mineral Resource	 An ‘Indicated Mineral Resource’ is that  part of a Mineral Resource for which  quantity, grade (or quality), densities,  shape and physical characteristics are  estimated with sufficient confidence  to allow the application of Modifying  Factors in sufficient detail to support  mine planning and evaluation of the  economic viability of the deposit.  Geological evidence is derived from  adequately detailed and reliable  exploration, sampling and testing  gathered through appropriate  techniques from locations such as  outcrops, trenches, pits, workings  and drill holes, and is sufficient to  assume geological and grade (or  quality) continuity between points of  observation where data and samples are  gathered. An Indicated Mineral Resource  has a lower level of confidence than  that applying to a Measured Mineral  Resource and may only be converted to  a Probable Ore Reserve.   ===== PAGE 179 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    177 Corporate governance Operating and   financial review Corporate directory Our approach to   sustainability Our approach to   climate change Directors' report    |  Remuneration Report  Financial report Overview Ore Reserves and  Mineral Resources Inferred Mineral Resource	 An ‘Inferred Mineral Resource’ is that  part of a Mineral Resource for which  quantity and grade (or quality) are  estimated on the basis of limited  geological evidence and sampling.  Geological evidence is sufficient  to imply but not verify geological  and grade (quality) continuity. It is  based on exploration, sampling and  testing information gathered through  appropriate techniques from locations  such as outcrops, trenches, pits,  workings and drill holes.  An Inferred Mineral Resource has a  lower level of confidence than that  applying to an Indicated Mineral  Resource and must not be converted  to an Ore Reserve. It is reasonably  expected that the majority of Inferred  Mineral Resources could be upgraded  to Indicated Mineral Resources with  continued exploration.

Kings CID Fines Fortescue’s standalone product  produced from Channel Iron   Deposit Ore from its Kings Valley  mine in the Solomon Hub, with an iron  content of 57.3% Fe. KMP Key management personnel are  those persons having authority and  responsibility for planning, directing  and controlling the activities of the  entity, directly or indirectly, including  any director (whether executive or  otherwise) of that entity. Magnetite	 An iron ore compound that is typically a  lower grade ore than hematite iron ore  because of a lower iron content. Magnetite ore requires significant  beneficiation to form a saleable  concentrate. After beneficiation,  Magnetite ore can be pelletised for  direct use as a high-grade raw material  for steel production. Measured Mineral Resource	 A ‘Measured Mineral Resource’ is  that part of a Mineral Resource for  which quantity, grade (or quality)  densities, shape, and physical  characteristics are estimated with  confidence sufficient to allow the  application of Modifying Factors  to support detailed mine planning  and final evaluation of the economic  viability of the deposit. Geological  evidence is derived from adequately  detailed and reliable exploration,  sampling and testing gathered  through appropriate techniques from  locations such as outcrops, trenches,  pits, workings and drill holes, and is  sufficient to confirm geological and  grade (or quality) continuity between  points of observation where data and  samples are gathered. A Measured  Mineral Resource has a higher level  of confidence than that applying to  either an Indicated Mineral Resource  or an Inferred Mineral Resource. It  may be converted to a Proved Reserve  or under certain circumstances to a  Probable Ore Reserve.  mt Million tonnes. mtpa	 Million tonnes per annum.

Probable Ore Reserve As defined in the JORC Code, the  economically mineable part of an  Indicated Resource, and in some  circumstances, a Measured Resource.  It includes diluting materials and  allowances for losses which may  occur when the material is mined.  Appropriate assessments and studies  have been carried out, and include  consideration of and modification  by realistically assumed mining,  metallurgical, economic, marketing,  legal, environmental, social and  governmental factors. These  assessments demonstrate at the time  of reporting that extraction could  reasonably be justified. Proved Ore Reserve	 As defined in the JORC Code, the  economically mineable part of a  Measured Resource. It includes diluting  materials and allowances for losses  which may occur when the material  is mined. Appropriate assessments  and studies have been carried out,  and include consideration of and  modification by realistically assumed  mining, metallurgical, economic,  marketing, legal, environmental, social  and governmental factors. These  assessments demonstrate at the time  of reporting that extraction could  reasonably be justified. Real zero	 Real Zero means the elimination  of greenhouse gas emissions from  our use of, or reliance on, fossil fuels  and replacement fuels (e.g. green  ammonia), wherever possible without  using offsets. Reserves or Ore Reserves	 As defined in the JORC Code,  the economically mineable part  of a Measured Resource and/or  an Indicated Mineral Resource.  It includes diluting materials and  allowances for losses, which may  occur when the material is mined.  Appropriate assessments and studies  have been carried out, and include  consideration of and modification  by realistically assumed mining,  metallurgical, economic, marketing,  legal, environmental, social and  governmental factors. These  assessments demonstrate at the time  of reporting that extraction could  reasonably be justified.

Fortescue can. It is 2030.   We are resolutely committed to meeting our Real Zero  target by 2030. Doing this will see us eliminate fossil fuels from our  operations without any reliance on voluntary carbon offsets.   Our progress can be tracked through our transparent annual  reporting, which makes that target real.   To date, that progress has been extraordinary.  In FY24, our emissions were around 10 per cent less than  what we forecasted. We fully commissioned Australia’s largest gas and liquid  hydrogen plant at our Christmas Creek mine, which is now  being used to refuel a fleet of fuel cell hydrogen-powered  coaches and our zero emissions prototypes.  We tested our battery electric haul truck prototype,  Roadrunner, at our Green Energy Hub at Christmas Creek  and its hydrogen-powered equivalent is now undergoing  similar testing after recently arriving in the Pilbara.  We have commenced commissioning of our 100 megawatt   (MW) solar farm at North Star Junction near Iron Bridge,  which will avoid up to 125,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide  equivalent from our operations every year. This is the first of more than one gigawatt (GW) of solar  infrastructure that we will build before the end of the  decade. Our US$6.2 billion decarbonisation plan is translating our  ambition into action. While Fortescue pursues its Real Zero target, the global shift  away from fossil fuels is at a critical juncture.  ===== PAGE 8 ===== Overview FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    4 At the time of writing, every month since June 2023 – 13  months in a row – has ranked as the planet’s hottest since  records began. The most recent data suggested 2024  was on track to surpass 2023 as the world’s hottest year. Yet despite climate change continuing to wreak havoc  around the world, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and war  in the Middle East has allowed political and business  leaders the excuse to slow or stop their own energy  transition. Electricity prices have skyrocketed and energy  policy settings in many countries are heavily influenced  by fossil fuel lobbyists compounding and accelerating  climate change against the interests of every living  organism. Fortescue has been alive to this. Since we launched our  green hydrogen ambitions in 2020, we have been clear  that our investments will flow to jurisdictions that most  effectively manage long-term climate risk.   As we decarbonise Fortescue, we have reflected this  focus through our commitment to developing four global  green hydrogen projects.   The Arizona Hydrogen project in the United States  and the Gladstone PEM50 Project in Australia were  Fortescue’s first Energy projects to reach Final Investment  Decision (FID).  Two larger projects, the Holmaneset Project in Norway  and the Pecém Project in Brazil, are progressing well  towards FID.    ===== PAGE 9 ===== FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    5 Overview Operating and   financial review Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability climate change  report Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Financial report Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Our landmark joint venture announced in April with  Morocco’s OCP Group, a global leader in plant nutrition and  phosphate-based fertilisers, will provide an extraordinary  opportunity to provide green hydrogen, ammonia and  fertilisers, domestically and to Europe.  Each of these projects draw on the unique strengths of the  countries they are in. They reflect jurisdictions which have  done the hard work to reduce green power costs, incentivise  job-creating investment and make overall project economics  stack up.   Where green power prices aren’t where they need to be,  Fortescue is determined to work in genuine partnership with  industry and government to drive prices down to enable  green industry.   This includes in Australia, where the Hydrogen Production  Tax Credit unveiled in May 2024 will be crucial to getting  green hydrogen projects off the ground as quickly as  possible.  Over the long term, Fortescue is taking a strong focus on  the export of green metal to China. This plan could eliminate  more than 200 million tonnes (Mt) per year from our Scope 3  emissions. In June, Fortescue welcomed H.E. Li Qiang, Premier of the  State Council of the People’s Republic of China, to its green  technology and test facility in Perth.  This historic visit provided a platform for continued  engagement with China on the creation of an Australia-Sino  green metal supply chain.   By meeting this market for green metal, Fortescue will  become one of the world’s largest consumers of green  hydrogen. For example, the production of 100Mt of green  metal will see us deploy around 8Mt of green hydrogen.   Our Christmas Creek Green Metal Project, which our  Board approved in November 2023 with a US$50 million  investment, will be crucial in proving this can be achieved  at scale. We commenced works on the Project earlier this  month.  And so, as we approach the halfway mark of the journey to  our Real Zero 2030 target, this is where our focus is.   It is the responsibility of every company to join us in moving  to a world that is no longer reliant on fossil fuels.  ===== PAGE 10 ===== Overview FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    6 We have a clear mission that unites   us here at Fortescue. That is to show   the world we can eliminate fossil fuels   and do it profitably. Our role is to be a leader, innovator and first mover in the  energy transition, by becoming the world’s leading green  technology, energy and metals company.  However, we acknowledge that what we’re doing is not easy. Luckily, that is where Fortescue thrives.  This business was built over the last 20 years by testing  limits and living in the uncomfortable. We create and use  cutting edge, innovative technologies to do things no one  thought was possible, and we’ve delivered large returns for  our shareholders in the process.  We’re taking those same skills and core Values created and  honed in the Pilbara and applying them to our operations in  the rest of the world, as we expand to become a truly global  company.  There’s no one doing what we are doing and what we are  doing is real, not just talk.  We’re making solid progress and showing others they can  do it too. Fortescue is steadfast in our commitment to the energy  transition.  However, our financial discipline always comes first. We will  never make investments that are not economically viable.  ENERGY CEO  MESSAGE Mark Hutchinson This year, Fortescue took three projects to Final Investment  Decision (FID). We’ve turned the soil to launch Arizona  Hydrogen, our green hydrogen plant in the United States and  started work on Gladstone PEM50, a 50MW green hydrogen  project utilising Fortescue’s own electrolyser technology.  Works have now started on a Green Metal Project at our  Green Energy Hub at Christmas Creek, which will use green  hydrogen to produce green metal. Our Board has also agreed to fast-track two more projects,  approving Early Investment Decisions to develop the front  end engineering designs and approvals for our next green  energy projects. Holmaneset is a green ammonia project  in Norway, which has received backing and funding by the  European Union, and our Pecém Green Hydrogen Project in  Brazil. On top of that, we have prospective projects in Oman,  Morocco, Jordan and Egypt that will follow next.  These are massive achievements, and we won’t be slowing  down.  We must continue to move fast, be agile and deliver for our  shareholders and our customers. Longer term, we totally believe that green hydrogen is what  the world ultimately needs and that is why we will continue to  maintain a significant portfolio of potential projects. However,  we are realistic about the pace of the current global energy  transition.  ===== PAGE 11 ===== FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    7 Overview Operating and   financial review Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability climate change  report Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Financial report Corporate   governance Corporate   directory As the green hydrogen market develops around the world,  it is really clear that the cost of green power has to be cost  effective to make projects viable. Therefore, where the power  costs are not at this level, we will work steadfastly with those  economies to help bring the costs of electricity down, by  producing electrons.  We’re creating a portfolio that is ambitious and develops  complementary capabilities across the entire green energy  value chain, from green electron and molecule production, to  battery power systems, green technology development and  of course green financing through Fortescue Capital. This means we can maximise efficiencies, innovation, and  create a real competitive leg-up on the competition, while  also having the knowledge base, adaptability and optionality  to quickly respond to shifts in market conditions and  capitalise on emerging opportunities. Being agile is what sets Fortescue apart. We are leading with breakthrough technologies, and thanks  to two decades of Fortescue experience, we also know how  to deploy that technology in the real world.  That is our real advantage.  We officially opened our Gladstone Electrolyser  Manufacturing Centre in Queensland earlier this year and  started selling our electrolyser systems. The message came  loud and clear from customers: Fortescue is a trusted and  reliable brand and because we understand the systems  that our products operate in, this is a clear competitive  advantage. Our longevity, balance sheet and financial discipline make us  a unique alternative to other first movers.  So, we’re applying that to our entire energy business.  The decarbonisation of Fortescue’s mining operations by  2030 is putting us at the forefront of innovation once again.  Technology is the key to everything that we’re doing.  We’ve developed the solutions in-house, joining together the  best engineering minds from the UK with our on-the-ground  experience in Australia to create our own Fortescue Zero  technologies. Electric excavators, hydrogen-powered and battery electric  haul trucks, large fast chargers and some great battery  software are already operating.  These green technologies will decarbonise Fortescue first,  but we’re already working to sell the same solutions and  products to other heavy industry players who need to also  eliminate their emissions.  What’s clear is there is a huge demand and a gap in the  market for what we’re creating, and Fortescue is being  recognised for leading the way.  The Green Pioneer is testament to that. Our dual-fuelled  ammonia-powered vessel was a winner at this year’s World  Hydrogen Awards, after successfully completing trials and  being certified in the Port of Singapore. This is a significant milestone and brings the world one step  closer to green shipping. It is invigorating to come to work every day and be  surrounded by a family of like-minded people, all pushing  and driving this business to be better, do more and achieve  what others think is impossible. What we’ve done as a team this year is incredible, and it’s  just the beginning.   ===== PAGE 12 ===== Overview FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    8 Driven by an ongoing focus on  productivity gains through innovation  and technology, Fortescue has grown to  become one of the world’s lowest cost  iron ore producers with more than two  billion tonnes shipped to our customers  since 2008. Our growth over the past  two decades has been remarkable,  testament to our never ever give up  mindset at Fortescue.    We are a company just getting started with an even more  prosperous future ahead in green technology, energy and  metals.  It was another incredible production result for the Metals  business this year, with full year shipments of 191.6Mt.  Following the challenges resulting from an ore car  derailment in December 2023, this result demonstrated  our unique culture and Values in action.   Importantly, we did this while maintaining our laser focus  on safety with a Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate  of 1.3 for Metals for the financial year – a 28 per cent  improvement from FY23. A truly amazing result.   METALS CEO  MESSAGE dino otranto During the financial year, we celebrated the 20th anniversary  since Fortescue was founded. Back then, we were a small  exploration company and now, we rival some of the world’s  biggest iron ore players through our world class mining  operations and infrastructure.  This year, we continued to ramp up commissioning of Iron  Bridge – our most innovative iron ore project yet, and we  achieved first ore from our Flying Fish deposit at our Eliwana  mine. Globally, we have a pipeline of exploration projects  underway, including in Latin America and Gabon as well as  the Pilbara.    As the climate crisis poses a growing threat to our very  existence, the need to reduce carbon emissions has never  been more urgent. Decarbonisation is not merely a buzzword  or a lofty goal. It’s a moral imperative, an economic necessity  and a pathway to a sustainable future. Fortescue’s mission is  to accelerate commercial decarbonisation of industry, rapidly,  profitably and globally.   By 2030, our aim is to have our mining operations in the  Pilbara running on green energy. It’s a massive undertaking,  but we can do it firstly because of the people we have,  but also because of the technology we are developing at  Fortescue Zero.  We are on track to meet our 2030 emissions reduction target  with several milestones achieved during the financial year.  We have now commissioned Australia’s largest gaseous  and liquid hydrogen plant on a mine site, which can produce  around 530 kilograms of hydrogen gas per day. This  renewable hydrogen plant is versatile, enabling us to produce  gaseous and liquid hydrogen to be used to power our mining  equipment prototypes and refuel our fleet of hydrogen- powered fuel cell coaches at Christmas Creek.    ===== PAGE 13 ===== FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    9 Overview Operating and   financial review Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability climate change  report Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Financial report Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Already, we have three electric excavators operating across  our sites which are powered by a 6.6kV substation and more  than two kilometres of high voltage trailing cable. Once we  decarbonise our entire excavator fleet, around 95 million  litres of diesel will be removed from our operations every  year.   We now have both our hydrogen-powered and battery  electric haul truck prototypes at the Pilbara completing   site-based testing.  Our progress on decarbonisation is evident right across the  business. This year, our aerodrome at Cloudbreak became  the first in Australia to have a fully operational, solar- powered airfield lighting system. The changeout of the 120  airfield lights to solar will result in a 20 per cent reduction  in power generation and diesel usage at our airstrip, while  delivering maintenance and cost benefits, as well as safety  improvements.   We see decarbonisation as a significant opportunity for our  business that will deliver cost savings and create a more  resilient supply chain that is less vulnerable to regulatory  changes.    Which brings me to green metal.  Right now, we are on the brink of a transformative moment in  the history of industry – the rise of green metal.   Pivoting to producing green metal is the next step for us.  It represents a departure from the status quo and entails  adopting innovative technologies to drastically reduce  emissions while rethinking the entire iron and steel value  chain.   This year we have commenced works on a Green Metal  Project at our Green Energy Hub at Christmas Creek. With  first production targeted next year, the plant will use green  hydrogen produced at our existing hydrogen facility to  produce high purity green metal that will be suitable for use  in almost any steel plant globally.   This is an incredibly exciting project for Fortescue and has  the potential to open new markets for us. As we look to the  future, we remain committed to delivering long-term value  for our shareholders and stakeholders.   At Fortescue, we don’t fear challenges. Instead, we embrace  them and tackle them head on.   Our progress to date on decarbonising demonstrates the  power of human ingenuity and what can be achieved when  great minds come together.  I would like to thank our more than 15,000 team members  globally who make up the Fortescue Family. Our strong  performance this year would not have been possible without  their dedication and commitment to achieving our stretch  targets every day.    As we continue this exciting phase of growth in Fortescue’s  journey, our work will always be underpinned by our unique  culture and Values.   Thank you for your continued support.    ===== PAGE 14 ===== Overview FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    10 OUR BOARD  1 Dr Larry Marshall was appointed Non-Executive Director on 28 August 2023 2 Usha Rao-Monari was appointed Non-Executive Director on 24 January 2024 3 Noel Pearson was appointed Non-Executive Director on 1 August 2024 ⁴ Dr Larry Marshall will be appointed as Lead Independent Director on the date of the AGM,   6 November 2024.

Our Metals business comprises our iron ore operations  in the Pilbara as well as a pipeline of exploration projects  globally including in Gabon in Africa, Latin America and  Australia. Our three Pilbara mining hubs are connected by 760  kilometres (km) of rail to Herb Elliott Port and the Judith  Street Harbour towage infrastructure in Port Hedland. As  a major supplier of iron ore to the Chinese steel industry,  we are now shipping at an annual rate of  over 190 million  tonnes (Mt) with more than two billion tonnes of iron ore  shipped since 2008. By 2030, our target is to have our Australian iron ore  operations running on green energy and achieve Real Zero  Scope 1 and 2 terrestrial emissions. Separately, we have  a net zero Scope 3 emissions target by 2040, addressing  emissions across our value chain. Our Energy business is building a global portfolio of  renewable green hydrogen and green ammonia projects and  developing green technology solutions. Our Fortescue Zero  technologies are also being developed to be sold to others  to further support the elimination of fossil fuel use globally. To support funding of our projects, we have established a  green energy investment accelerator platform, Fortescue  Capital, that is headquartered in New York. As our business develops globally, our commitment to  building thriving communities expands with us. Delivering  positive social and economic change through training,  employment and business development opportunities is a  key focus for Fortescue. This is evident through initiatives  such as our Billion Opportunities program which has  awarded more than A$5 billion in contracts to Australian  First Nations businesses since it was established in 2011.   Solar and wind locations are  subject to further studies and  regulatory approvals.  ===== PAGE 25 ===== FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    21 Overview Operating and   financial review Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability climate change  report Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Financial report Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Western Hub  Our Western Hub includes two mines – Solomon and Eliwana  – near the Hamersley Ranges 60km north of Tom Price and  120km west of the Chichester Hub. Solomon commenced operation in 2012, while Eliwana  (located 140km west of Solomon) opened in December  2020. With its innovative low profile designed OPF and dual  stacker reclaimer, Eliwana has the capacity to direct load up  to 9,000 tonnes (t) per hour.  Together, these mines have a production capacity of around  100mtpa. Iron Bridge  Iron Bridge is Fortescue’s first magnetite mining operation  and is located 145km south of Port Hedland.  Unlike Fortescue’s hematite operations, Iron Bridge  produces a wet concentrate product which is transported to  Port Hedland through a 135km-long specialist slurry pipeline  where dewatering and materials handling occurs. It also  includes a return water pipeline.  Iron Bridge is an unincorporated joint venture between FMG  Magnetite Pty Ltd (69 per cent) and Formosa Steel IB Pty Ltd  (31 per cent).  Green Metal Project  Located at Christmas Creek, the Green Metal Project  represents a significant step forward in Fortescue’s ambition  to produce green metal at a commercial scale in the Pilbara. It will use renewable energy and green hydrogen reduction  technology together with an electric smelting furnace to  produce high-purity green metal that will be suitable for use  in almost any steel plant globally. Fortescue defines ‘green metal’ as metal ore mined and  processed into metal using renewable energy and with near  zero carbon emissions. This green metal definition similarly  applies to processing iron ore into iron. METALS One of the world’s largest  producers of iron ore  Established in 2003, Fortescue was founded as a metals  company. Since our first ore was produced at Cloudbreak  in 2005, we have expanded our Pilbara mining operations,  delivering both hematite and magnetite products to the  international market. Hedland operations  Our Herb Elliott Port at Port Hedland includes five operating  berths with current approvals to export up to 210 million  tonnes per annum (mtpa) of iron ore.  Our fleet of 10 tugs, based at our Judith Street Harbour  towage facility, is critical to the safe operation of  our shipping activities, including our fleet of eight  260,000t-capacity Fortescue ore carriers.  Each year, we load and ship more than 970 carriers of iron  ore from Herb Elliott Port, significantly contributing to Port  Hedland’s status as the world’s largest bulk export port by  tonnage. Chichester Hub  Our Chichester Hub in the Chichester Ranges includes two  mines, Cloudbreak and Christmas Creek, which have an  annual production capacity of around 100mtpa from three  ore processing facilities (OPFs). Trial iron ore mining commenced at Cloudbreak in October  2005 followed by first iron ore production in May 2008.  Christmas Creek is now home to Fortescue’s Green Energy  Hub and is the site of the Green Metal Project.  A 60 megawatt (MW) solar farm contributes power to  daytime operations at the Chichester Hub, displacing  around 100ML of diesel every year.   ===== PAGE 26 ===== Overview FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    22 Using hydrogen produced at our existing hydrogen facility at  Christmas Creek, annual production is expected to be more  than 1,500t, with first production anticipated in 2025. Locating the project at Christmas Creek will allow Fortescue  to demonstrate a ‘green pit to product’ supply chain, with  the Company’s green mining fleet able to be paired with  green metal making. The ironmaking technology will support  Fortescue’s magnetite and hematite ores. Integrated Operations  Our Fortescue Hive is a purpose-built integrated operations  centre in Perth which brings together people, process and  technology across our supply chain.  The Hive operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, using  advanced mining technology to remotely and safely control  fixed plant and autonomous mining equipment, as well as  our port and rail facilities across our Pilbara operations.  The Hive was commissioned in March 2020. It includes  four specialist departments – Mine Control and Systems  (autonomous drills and haul trucks), Port and OPF  Control, Instrumentation and Process Control, and Energy  Operations.  The Hive is a key launchpad for artificial intelligence (AI)  at Fortescue, which is driving significant value across  the business. This includes using AI to predict outcomes  and support better decision-making, optimise plans and  schedules and improve overall performance.  Renewable power AT our mining  operations   Through our Pilbara Energy Connect (PEC) project, we  have integrated our stationary energy requirements in the  Pilbara into an efficient network. The initial phase included  the construction of a 100MW solar farm at North Star  Junction, and 500km of transmission lines and associated  substations. This is the first of around 1.5 gigawatts (GW) that  we will build before the end of the decade. As we continue to decarbonise our operations, our focus  is now on expanding the PEC infrastructure to provide an  integrated transmission network that will enable renewable  electricity generated at any of Fortescue’s sites to move  between our operations.  To date, the following decarbonisation projects have  commenced: 1.  Construction of approximately 140km of 220 kilovolt (kV)  transmission lines, and necessary substations, to supply  both our Eliwana and Flying Fish mining hubs 2.  Early design and procurement for approximately 110km of  220kV transmission lines and associated substations, to  supply our Cloudbreak and Christmas Creek mines 3.  Design of the Cloudbreak 130MW solar farm  4.  The installation of the 50MW/250MWh Battery Energy  Storage System (BESS) to support the North Star Junction  solar plant, and provide renewable energy at night 5.  The design and construction of a 20MW/120MWh BESS  to support the Eliwana and Flying Fish mining hubs, and  provide renewable energy at night. Belinga Iron Ore Project, Gabon  The Belinga Project in north-east Gabon is potentially one of  the largest undeveloped high grade hematite deposits in the  world. Fortescue began exploration in 2022 with activities  focused on exploration drilling to support a feasibility study.  First ore was shipped during the pilot production phase in  FY24 and the current focus is on exploration and studies. Delivering local opportunities for the people of Gabon is a  top priority. Ivindo Iron SA is the operating entity for the Belinga Project,  with Fortescue holding a 72 per cent direct interest in the  company. Critical minerals and iron ore  exploration Fortescue was founded as an exploration company and  we still believe that early stage exploration is the key to  unlocking significant value. Fortescue holds the largest  tenement portfolio in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.  The resources in both the Western Hub and Eastern  Hamersley include significant amounts of high iron content  bedded iron ore, adding dry, low-cost tonnes to Fortescue’s  resource inventory. During FY24, activities focused on  advanced exploration at Mindy South, Wyloo North and  White Knight. In addition, near-mine exploration continues to  be a focus at both Solomon and the Chichester Hub.  In the critical minerals portfolio, Fortescue has an exploration  focus on copper, lithium and rare earths. Exploration drilling  is active in multiple jurisdictions, including Argentina, Chile,  Brazil, Peru and Australia. Other exploration activities are  progressing across the broader Latin American portfolio,  and in Australia, Canada and Portugal.  ===== PAGE 27 ===== FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    23 Overview Operating and   financial review Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability climate change  report Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Financial report Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Arizona Hydrogen, USA  Located in Buckeye, Arizona, the Arizona Hydrogen project  is Fortescue’s first venture into liquid green hydrogen  production in the USA.

Second half results include  the impact of the derailment in early Q3 FY24, whereby a  recovery plan was successfully implemented to achieve  FY24 shipped volumes. Fortescue’s recovery plan focused  on value optimisation through flexibility and improvements  in the supply chain combined with refinements in the  product portfolio. Inclusive in Fortescue’s FY24 shipments  was 1.2Mt of Iron Bridge Concentrate, reflecting the  successful transition from project to the operations phase,  and 190.4Mt of hematite.  Fortescue’s total sales were 191Mt in FY24. Sales via  Fortescue’s wholly owned Chinese sales entity, FMG Trading  Shanghai, were 11.3Mt in FY24 (FY23: 16.7Mt). This entity  allows Fortescue to expand its iron ore sales channels  through the direct supply of products to Chinese customers  in smaller volumes, in Renminbi, directly from regional ports.  Hematite ore mined decreased in FY24 to 204Mt (FY23:  218Mt) while waste mining is consistent year on year,  reflecting an increase to strip ratio (FY24: 1.6x, FY23: 1.5x).  Mining volumes and strip ratio reflect the life cycle of  existing operations at the Chichester and Western Hub and  are consistent with the requirements to support Fortescue’s  integration of its operations with its marketing strategy.  Hematite ore processing reduced marginally in FY24 to  188Mt (FY23: 192Mt), reflecting consistent performance and  reliability through existing ore processing facilities (OPFs).  Fortescue’s hematite operations have a combination of both  wet and dry OPFs aligning with the characteristics of the ore  bodies.  Iron Bridge transitioned to operational production in  August 2023 and the first shipment of high-grade (67%  Fe) magnetite product was in September 2023. Iron  Bridge combines innovative and proven technology for  the production of magnetite concentrate that provides  Fortescue an enhanced product range. In FY24, 13.0Mt of  ore was mined at Iron Bridge, with Iron Bridge Concentrate  production of 2.1Mt and shipments of 1.2Mt (100 per cent  basis). The Iron Bridge operation when operating at full  capacity aims to deliver 22Mt per annum of high-grade, low- impurity concentrate. Iron Bridge is an unincorporated joint  venture between FMG Magnetite Pty Ltd (69 per cent) and  Formosa Steel IB Pty Ltd (31 per cent). Fortescue’s Belinga project in Gabon, is an incorporated  joint venture entity, with Ivindo Iron SA. In FY24 the Belinga  Project made a shipment through the Gabon Joint Venture  Company, Ivindo Iron SA, representing the first time  Fortescue has exported iron ore outside of Australia.  ===== PAGE 35 ===== Overview Operating and   financial review FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    31 Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability climate change  report Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Financial report Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Marketing and Product  Strategy Fortescue’s integrated operations and customer-focused  marketing strategy underpins the Company’s ongoing  strong market penetration with a product portfolio that  meets customer requirements and maximises value.  The majority of Fortescue’s customers are in China as it  continues to represent more than 50 per cent of global  steel production. Domestic steel demand is supported by  infrastructure, manufacturing and renewable energy sectors,  in addition to direct and indirect steel exports. While China  remains Fortescue’s core focus, the Company continues to  explore sales to other important markets. Market dynamics and industry structures continue to evolve,  with Fortescue adapting its commercial strategy to optimise  value over time, to manage risk and market volatility. Innovation and Technology The Company continues to look for other opportunities  for automation and artificial intelligence to drive greater  efficiency across the business, including the use of data  to predict outcomes, optimise plans and schedules and  improve overall performance, the expansion of autonomy to  fixed plant and non-mining equipment, and the application  of relocatable conveyor technology.   Through Fortescue Zero, Fortescue is making significant  progress in developing green technology solutions in house. Decarbonisation Key considerations for our pathway to decarbonise include  development of technology, future equipment acquisitions  and potential regulatory changes. Future changes to  Fortescue’s decarbonisation strategy may impact key  estimates and changes to asset carrying values in the  Group’s financial statements.  Fortescue has a plan to reach Real Zero emissions by  2030, and has so far identified the solutions it plans to  adopt to eliminate approximately 90 per cent of terrestrial  Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from its Australian iron  ore operations. Our decarbonisation plan includes the  deployment of an additional 2-3 gigawatt (GW) of renewable  energy generation and battery storage, in addition to the  deployment of a green mining fleet and locomotives. Key milestones achieved during FY24 include:  •	 commissioning of Australia’s first operational electric  excavator at Fortescue’s Cloudbreak operation in  partnership with Liebherr. There are three 400t electric  excavators now in operation at Fortescue with two of these  at Solomon and one at Cloudbreak •	 construction and start of commissioning of a 100 MW solar  farm at North Star Junction. North Star will complement  the 60MW solar farm commissioned in 2021 as part of the  Chichester Solar Gas Hybrid Project •	 completion of the first phase testing of the battery power  system in our battery electric haul truck prototype,  Roadrunner, at our Green Energy Hub at Christmas Creek •	 completed onsite commissioning of our fast charger  prototype and transferred at 3MW into our 240t battery  electric haul truck, Roadrunner •	 development and commissioning of a hydrogen fuel cell  battery electric haul truck (Europa) prototype. Delivered  in collaboration with Liebherr, Europa is a T 264 Liebherr  haul truck and contains a Fortescue Zero battery and 500  kilowatts of fuel cells. The prototype can store over 380  kilograms of liquid hydrogen •	 commenced onsite commissioning of our prototype  Offboard Power Unit which successfully powered a  retrofitted Liebherr electric excavator utilising hydrogen •	 completed onsite commissioning of our ammonia powered  locomotive. Mainline testing is now underway •	 completed validation testing of the KTA50 Marine Engine  Land Based Test Spread with DNV Class approval.  There are, and there will continue to be, technical challenges  related to decarbonisation. As part of addressing these  challenges, existing technology will need to be adapted and  applied in new ways, and entirely new technology will also  need to be developed. Technology availability (including  supply chain availability of relevant goods and services)  and technology maturity are therefore key issues. These are  challenges the team at Fortescue are focused on overcoming,  both to deliver on our own Real Zero ambitions, but also to  facilitate the decarbonisation of heavy industry more broadly.  Fortescue’s capital expenditure on decarbonisation in FY24  was US$224 million including Pilbara Energy Connect (PEC). More information can be found in our FY24 Climate Change  report.  ===== PAGE 36 ===== Operating and financial review FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    32 Metals Projects Belinga Iron Ore Project Exploration was the dominant activity for FY24, with a focus  on both diamond and reverse circulation drilling programs.  As of 30 June 2024, over 45,000 metres of reverse  circulation and 7,000 metres of diamond core have been  drilled. The results have continued to show that this project  has the potential to be significant scale and high grade. The  focus is on exploration and studies to advance potential  designs for large scale development. Ivindo Iron SA is the operating company for the Belinga  project, and Fortescue has a 72 per cent interest in this  company. Green Metal Project Utilising green hydrogen and green electricity from solar  generation, iron ore production capacity and existing  infrastructure and technical capacity, Fortescue is  developing a Green Metal Project at Christmas Creek.  Annual production is expected to be more than 1,500 tonnes  of green metal, with first production anticipated in 2025.  Total project capital expenditure of up to US$50 million. Critical Minerals and Iron Ore Exploration Iron ore exploration activity in the Pilbara during FY24  focused on Mindy South, White Knight and Wyloo North.  In addition, near mine exploration continues to be a focus  at both Solomon and Chichester Hub. Studies continue to  progress in these areas.  Early-stage studies and option analysis are underway for  near-mine opportunities, as well as strategic assessments  to support the future portfolio. Baseline studies continue  with investigation to support approvals, while also working  closely with Traditional Custodians and stakeholders.   In the critical minerals portfolio, Fortescue is ramping  up exploration activities with a key focus on copper, rare  earths and lithium. Additionally, a Farm-in and Joint Venture  agreement was announced with Magmatic Resources Ltd  on the Myall porphyry copper project in New South Wales,  which resulted in Fortescue acquiring a 19.9 per cent stake  in the company. Exploration in South America focused on drilling at several  projects in Argentina and Chile as well as opportunies  in Peru in 2024. A drilling program targeting rare earth  elements concluded in Brazil, with other regional exploration  activities ongoing. Total exploration and studies capital expenditure in FY24  was US$266 million.   ===== PAGE 37 ===== Overview Operating and   financial review FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    33 Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability climate change  report Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Financial report Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Fortescue Energy is working to eliminate emissions, not  only from Fortescue’s operations, but from our planet.  That is why Fortescue has green energy projects under  development globally. We continue to establish the building  blocks of a new global renewable energy value chain, by  developing green technologies for trucks, trains, planes,  ships, electrolysers, solar, cables, wind, batteries, hydrogen  fuel cells and the digital industry.  Fortescue Energy comprises the integrated segments of  Green Energy, Fortescue Zero and Fortescue Capital.  Green Energy – green electrons  and green molecules Fortescue’s Green Energy business is committed to  producing green electrons and green molecules (including  green hydrogen, green ammonia and other green  derivatives) from renewable sources, to support global  decarbonisation efforts.  Following FID in November 2023, Fortescue has turned  the soil to launch Arizona Hydrogen, a green hydrogen  project in the United States. This is an 80MW electrolyser  and liquefaction facility, with production capacity of up to  11,000 tonnes per annum of liquid green hydrogen. Capital  expenditure of up to US$550 million was approved, with first  production expected in 2026. Construction has commenced on the PEM50 project in  Gladstone, Australia. This is a two-stage 50MW green  hydrogen project, with total capital expenditure of up to  US$150 million across both phases. Phase one comprises  the installation of a 30MW electrolyser plant, utilising  Fortescue’s own Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM)  electrolysers. First production of green hydrogen is  anticipated in 2025. Phase two will see the remaining 20MW  capacity installed and commissioned in 2028. The 50MW  plant is projected to have production capacity of 8,000  tonnes per annum of green hydrogen. The Board also agreed to fast-track projects in Norway  and Brazil, moving them into the feasibility stage  and progressing with front end engineering designs.  Holmaneset is a green ammonia project in Norway, which  has received backing and funding from the European  Union, and our Pecém Project in Brazil will be able to take  advantage of the country’s green hydrogen regulations. FORTESCUE  ENERGY Fortescue Zero – green  technologies Fortescue Zero is the green technology and engineering  services business, creating the solutions required to drive  a zero emissions future. Such technologies include PEM  electrolysers and balance of systems, high performance  battery systems and digital battery intelligence software.

Hematite C1 costs averaged US$18.24/wmt for the year, four per cent higher compared to the prior period (FY23: US$17.54/wmt).  The increase in C1 costs reflects market an increase in strip ratio to 1.6x in FY24 from 1.5x in FY23. Furthermore, the C1 costs also  reflects market inflationary pressures, including labour cost pressures due to significant demand for skilled labour across the  resources industry combined with increases in mining services. These cost pressures were partially offset through ongoing focus on productivity and favourable AUD to USD exchange rates  averaging 0.66 in FY24 compared to 0.67 in FY23. Shipping costs have increased from US$1,455 million in FY23 to US$1,531 million in FY24, reflecting the increase in market  freight rates. To meet Fortescue’s shipping commitments, Fortescue employs a mix of shipping options which includes the use of  Fortescue-operated ore carriers, chartering third-party vessels and free on board shipments. Fortescue has actively managed cost increases throughout the cycle while also utilising the capacity in its supply chain to  generate consistent shipments, aligning with Fortescue’s integrated operating and marketing strategy focusing on maximising  value  through the market cycle.  ===== PAGE 42 ===== Operating and financial review FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    38 Financial performance UNDERLYING EBITDA Underlying EBITDA, defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, exploration, development and  other expenses, is used as a key measure of the Company’s financial performance.

As illustrated in the chart below, Fortescue has maintained strong Underlying EBITDA margins through market cycles,  demonstrating the commitment to and focus on productivity, efficiency and innovation.  Underlying Metals EBITDA by period below (including Iron Bridge Magnetite and excluding Fortescue Energy costs):  Research and administration  expenses Research expenditure reflects underlying research activities  within Fortescue Energy in the development of green  energy projects and technology as well as research on  decarbonisation. Total Fortescue Energy EBITDA was a  US$659 million loss in FY24. Depreciation, interest and tax Key non-operating matters forming part of the financial  result include: •	 depreciation and amortisation of US$2,144 million is up 23 per  cent on the prior period (FY23: US$1,744 million) reflecting  increases in sustaining capital expenditure over multiple  financial years and the commissioning of assets including Iron  Bridge in FY24 •	 net interest expenses of $168 million for FY24 (US$126 million  in FY23) reflects higher interest rates on borrowings and lease  liabilities and lower capitalised interest, offset by an increase  in interest income of US$218 million •	 income tax expense for FY24 of US$2,636 million represents  an effective tax rate of 31.8 per cent (FY23: US$2,090 million,  effective tax rate of 30.4 per cent). The increase in income tax  is in line with financial performance and reflects the effects of  taxation on foreign operations.

Reporting is grouped by operating and development properties and  includes both hematite and magnetite deposits. The Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimation  processes followed internally are well established and  are subject to systematic internal peer review, including  calibration against operational outcomes. Independent  technical reviews and audits are undertaken on an as- required basis as part of Fortescue’s risk management  process. In addition to routine internal audits and peer review,  auditing of the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates  is addressed as a sub-set of the annual internal audit plan  approved by the Board Audit and Risk Management and  Sustainability Committee (ARMSC). Audits of the Ore  Reserve process are managed by Fortescue’s internal  audit service provider with external technical subject  experts.  Independent auditing of a sub-set of Ore  Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates is conducted  on an approximately annual basis by external technical  consultants.   The ARMSC also monitors the Ore Reserve and Mineral  Resource status and recommends it to the Board for  approval. The annual Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource  updates are a prescribed activity within the annual  corporate planning calendar that includes a schedule  of regular executive engagement meetings to approve  assumptions and guide the overall process. Tonnage and quality information contained in the following  tables have been rounded and as a result the figures may  not add up to the totals quoted.  ===== PAGE 50 ===== Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    46 Ore Reserves Operating  Properties – Hematite The combined Chichester Hub and Western Hub Hematite  Ore Reserves for 2024 are estimated to total 1,701Mt at an  average Fe grade of 57.4%. The Ore Reserve is quoted as of 30 June 2024 and is  inclusive of ore and product stockpiles at mines. Product  stockpiles at port have been excluded from contributing to  Ore Reserves. The proportion of higher confidence Proved  Ore Reserve has increased to 1,102Mt (from 994Mt in 2023)  after accounting for the production depletion and ongoing  in-fill drilling. Fortescue is advancing studies on various potential  brownfield near-mine and greenfield development  opportunities within its portfolio, including the Mindy South  and Nyidinghu projects. The company is committed to  maintaining portfolio flexibility, ensuring that these deposits  can be incorporated into the Ore Reserves once assessed to  the appropriate level of study. The Chichester Hub (Cloudbreak and Christmas Creek  deposits) contains 830Mt at an average Fe grade of 57.3%,  a net decrease of 155Mt primarily due to depletion and  reclassification of localised Indicated Resources to Inferred  at Christmas Creek. Proved Ore Reserve constitutes   74.0 per cent of the Chichester Ore Reserve, an increase  of 16 per cent compared to the previous Ore Reserves as  reported in 2023. While the Cloudbreak and Christmas  Creek deposits are quoted separately for historical reasons,  they effectively represent a single deposit with ore generally  directed to the most proximal of the three available ore  processing facilities (OPFs). The Ore Reserve for the Western Hub (Firetail, Kings and  Queens, Eliwana and Flying Fish deposits) is estimated to  be 871mt at an average Fe grade of 57.4%. The contribution  (tonnes and grades) of the Western Hub alone has  reduced by 10mt, after accounting for depletion and any  increase in Mineral Resource tonnes, along with pit design  modifications and exclusion of areas containing sites of  heritage significance. Proved Ore Reserves comprise 56 per  cent of the tonnage in the total Western Hub Ore Reserve,  which is an increase of eight per cent as compared to 2023  Ore Reserves. The 2024 Hematite Ore Reserve estimates were subject to  comprehensive review and update addressing: •	 Ore depletion as a result of sales (decrease) •	 Exclusions of sites of heritage significance, permanent  infrastructures (OPF, Tailings storage facility etc), pit  redesigns and tenement boundaries  •	 Revision of ore loss and dilution factors based on Life of  Mine (LOM) historical operational history at all mines  •	 Revision to the processing response through all OPFs  based on updated metallurgical test work and operational  history  •	 Re-optimisation of mine geometries to maximise the  benefit of changes to the resource base resulting in  improvement to the economic viability of extracting ore •	 A revised LOM plan that addresses the listed items and  incorporates the latest information on long term product  strategy, including the Western Pilbara Fines 60.3% Fe  product and Fortescue lump.  ===== PAGE 51 ===== Overview Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    47 Operating and   financial review Our approach   to sustainability climate change  report Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Financial report Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Ore Reserves Operating Properties – Hematite  30 JUNE 2024 30 JUNE 2023    Product  tonnes  (Mt) Iron  Fe   % Silica  SiO₂   % Alumina  Al2O3   % Phos  P   % LOI   % Product   tonnes  (Mt) Iron  Fe   % Silica  SiO2   % Alumina  Al2O3   % Phos  P   % LOI   % Cloudbreak Proved 280 57.5 5.23 2.79 0.058 8.1 270 57.6 5.12 2.82 0.056 8.1 Probable 51 56.5 6.47 3.16 0.056 8.3 91 56.6 5.57 3.12 0.056 8.4 Total 331 57.4 5.42 2.85 0.058 8.1 361 57.3 5.23 2.89 0.056 8.2 Christmas Creek Proved 334 57.2 5.61 2.82 0.051 8.0 297 57.2 5.96 2.63 0.052 7.9 Probable  165 57.6 5.82 2.75 0.052 5.6 327 57.2 6.05 2.91 0.054 7.7 Total 499 57.3 5.68 2.80 0.051 7.2 624 57.2 6.01 2.78 0.053 7.8 Sub-total Chichester Hub Proved 614 57.3 5.43 2.81 0.054 8.1 568 57.4 5.55 2.72 0.054 8.0 Probable 216 57.4 5.97 2.84 0.053 6.2 418 57.0 5.95 2.96 0.055 7.9 Total 830 57.3 5.58 2.82 0.054 7.6 985 57.2 5.72 2.82 0.054 7.9 Firetail Proved 16  58.9 6.35 2.19 0.123 6.6 16 59.3 5.61 2.20 0.127 6.9 Probable 30  58.1 7.05 2.54 0.113  6.6 35 58.5 6.37 2.60 0.116 7.1 Total 46  58.3 6.83 2.43 0.116 6.6 51 58.7 6.13 2.47 0.119 7.0 Kings and Queens Proved 316 56.8 6.87 2.83 0.073 8.7 233 56.7 6.80 2.95 0.080 8.9 Probable 331 56.8 6.61 2.72 0.079 9.2 383 56.8 6.90 2.91 0.082 8.8 Total 647 56.8 6.74 2.77 0.076 8.9 616 56.7 6.86 2.93 0.081 8.8 Eliwana and Flying Fish  Proved 156 59.5 4.87 2.68 0.112 6.5 177 59.4 5.01 2.72 0.115 6.6 Probable 22 59.0 4.96 2.54 0.072 7.1 36 59.3 4.71 2.62 0.069 6.9 Total 178 59.4 4.88 2.66 0.107 6.6 213 59.4 4.96 2.70 0.107 6.6 Sub-total Western Hub Proved 488 57.7 6.22 2.76 0.087 7.9 426 57.9 6.02 2.83 0.096 7.9 Probable 383 57.0 6.55 2.69 0.081 8.9 455 54.2 5.59 2.60 0.096 7.4 Total 871 57.4 6.36 2.73 0.085 8.4 881 57.5 6.36 2.84 0.090 8.2 Total Ore Reserves Operating Properties – Hematite Proved 1,102 57.5 5.78 2.79 0.069 8.0 994 57.6 5.74 2.77 0.072 7.9 Probable 599 57.1 6.34 2.75 0.071  7.9 872 57.1 6.33 2.91 0.070 8.2 Total 1,701 57.4 5.98 2.77 0.070  8.0 1,866 57.4 6.02 2.83 0.071 8.1 Notes in reference to table •	 Diluted mining models are validated by reconciliation against historical production •	 Ore Reserves are inclusive of ore stockpiles at the mines which total approximately 54Mt on dry product basis •	 The Chichester Ore Reserve is inclusive of the Cloudbreak, Christmas Creek and Kutayi deposits •	 The Western Hub Ore Reserve is inclusive of the Firetail, Kings and Queens, Eliwana and Flying Fish deposits •	 As part of Fortescue’s ongoing review process, areas of heritage significance (where appropriate) have been excluded from the Ore Reserves •	 Due to opportunistic blending and stockpiling, the Ore Reserve is not reported at a fixed cut-off and Ore Reserves are reported above a range of ROM Fe  cut-off grades from 52% Fe to 54% Fe depending on the grade tonnage profile available from various deposits to meet the product quality specifications.  ===== PAGE 52 ===== Ore Reserves Operating  Properties – Magnetite The 2024 Ore Reserves for Magnetite are from the Iron  Bridge project. Ore Reserves for the project total 832Mt at  an average mass recovery of 29.9% for a 67.3% Fe grade  product. The Ore Reserves are quoted as of 30 June 2024,  on a dry in-situ tonnes basis prior to processing. The Ore Reserves estimate was developed in May and  June 2024 by the Iron Bridge technical team based on the  2023 resource model using detailed information on mining,  geotechnical and metallurgical processing parameters  and latest cost assumptions, aligned with the proposed  operations strategy. Within North Star, mining activities within 100m of the  Pilbara Leaf Nosed Bat (PLNB) cave, identified as Cave 13,  is prohibited by the current Stage 2 Ministerial Approval  (Condition 10) until such time it can be demonstrated  that ground disturbing activity in the area maintains the  viability of the population of PLNB. Primary environmental  approvals for the Glacier Valley resource are in progress and  currently with state and Federal regulators. At this stage,  neither of the above is expected to have a material impact  on Ore Reserves as plans have been developed and action  underway to address each of the points. As part of the mine  scheduling process, appropriate access delays are applied  to ore inventory in the North Star mining pit within 100m of  the PLNB cave and Glacier Valley mining area to model the  timeframe required for approvals. The Ore Reserves have been estimated from Measured and  Indicated Mineral Resources from within the North Star,  Eastern Limb and Glacier Valley mining areas. All Magnetite  Ore Reserves are classified as Probable Reserves due to the  lack of full-scale production history, as only initial sales and  production have occurred for Magnetite as of 30 June 2024.

Additional  exclusions, of mostly Inferred material, have been applied  at both Christmas Creek and Cloudbreak due to dewatering  constraints in the southern, deeper parts of the orebody.  These exclusions align with Ore Reserves. The total Western Hub (Firetail, Kings and Queens, Eliwana  and Flying Fish deposits) Mineral Resource is estimated  to be 2,777Mt at an average Fe grade of 56.1%, with 60 per  cent of the tonnage in the Measured and Indicated Mineral  Resource categories. As part of Fortescue’s ongoing review process, areas  of heritage significance (where appropriate) have been  excluded from the Mineral Resources.

Mineral Resources Development  Properties – Hematite Updates have been announced for all reporting hubs in  the development properties Mineral Resources as a result  of exploration drilling. An updated estimate for the White  Knight deposit in the Greater Chichester Hub has resulted  in an increase of 111Mt. An updated estimate for the Serenity  deposit has resulted in downgrading the classification in  some areas to better reflect the confidence in the estimate;  overall this update has resulted in an increase of 28Mt in the  Greater Solomon Hub. Updated estimates at the Wyloo North,  Lora and Flying Fish South deposits, and the exclusion of the  Vivash deposit due to heritage significance in the Greater  Western Hub, has resulted in a decrease of 88Mt. An updated  estimate for the Nyidinghu deposit in the Nyidinghu Hub has  resulted in an increase of 92Mt. Updated estimates at the  Mindy South and Earendil deposits in the Pilbara Other Hub  have resulted in an increase of 109Mt. Areas identified as  containing sites of heritage significance have been excluded  from reporting at deposits across all hubs. This update is  an overall increase of 253Mt to the development properties  Mineral Resources and is reported in accordance with the  JORC Code as identified in the Fortescue ASX releases when  each Mineral Resource was announced.  As of 30 June 2024, the total Mineral Resource for  development properties, which excludes and is additional  to the operating properties, is estimated to be 8,534Mt at  an average Fe grade of 57.0%.

All magnetite  Mineral Resources are reported within a high revenue factor  pit shell (US$200/t) to constrain the reportable resource to  mineralisation that has reasonable prospects for economic  extraction by open-pit mining and has been adjusted for  depletion of mined tonnes.  The pit shell used to constrain  the June 2024 magnetite Mineral Resource was updated  using detailed information on mining, geotechnical and  metallurgical processing parameters, along with the latest  cost assumptions, aligned with the proposed operations  strategy. Where appropriate, heritage sites have been  excluded from the Mineral Resource using engineered  shapes to account for the pit slope. As of 30 June 2024, the total magnetite Mineral Resource  is estimated to be 6,198Mt (from 6,475Mt in 2023) at an  average mass recovery of 23.1 per cent, reported above a 9  per cent mass recovery cut-off. The decrease is a function  of the updated pit shell used to constrain the magnetite  Mineral Resource, along with updated heritage exclusions in  the Glacier Valley and South Star areas.

Our sustainability ambition is focused on ensuring  that both society and the environment benefit from  our business as we take a global leadership role in  addressing climate change and supporting the transition  to green energy. This overarching ambition drives our  stretch targets and our sustainability performance. Sustainability is integrated into our decision-making  and our strategic and risk management processes.  Compliance with all relevant legislation and obligations,  including those that govern health, safety and  environment, is the absolute minimum standard to which  we operate.  Our sustainability commitments are developed in  collaboration with our stakeholders and aim to create  value for our investors, ensure the health and safety of  our employees, protect the environment and empower  the communities in which we operate.  Good governance is critical to strong sustainability  performance and is the collective responsibility of our  Board and all levels of management. Fortescue seeks to  adopt leading practice and contemporary governance  standards and apply these in a manner consistent with  our unique culture and Values.  Sustainability Governance Our Board is responsible for the oversight of all  sustainability matters, which prior to 1 July 2024 received  regular updates through the ARMSC1. Operationally, sustainability is directed by our Chief  Executive Officers and Chief Operating Officer with  support from our executive Sustainability Committee. The executive Sustainability Committee meets at  least quarterly to define our sustainability framework  and oversee implementation across the business  and continuous improvement. In FY24, the executive  Sustainability Committee facilitated executive  endorsement of all key outcomes endorsed or approved  by the ARMSC. Our sustainability strategy outlines commitments and  targets and provides implementation guidance. The early  identification and assessment of sustainability risks and  opportunities helps to shape the way we do business at  Fortescue.  Our dedicated Sustainability team, managed by our  Director Sustainability and External Affairs, coordinates  the implementation of our sustainability strategy, related  policies and targets across the business.  Sustainability materiality Sustainability materiality is evolving beyond  consideration of the impacts and dependencies of a  business. It also considers the corresponding financial  risks, opportunities and impacts to the business  resulting from climate change, global environmental  concerns, human rights violations and shifting societal  expectations. To reflect the evolution of sustainability reporting  requirements, as well as our own business transition  to an integrated green technology, energy and metals  company, this year Fortescue has performed our  first sustainability double materiality assessment.  The assessment forms the basis for refreshing our  sustainability strategy and material topics. With this  approach, we continue to consider the outward social  and environmental impacts associated with our business  activities, as well as the inward sustainability-related risks  and opportunities to our financial performance.  The FY24 sustainability materiality process considered  both finance and impact materiality by aligning to the key  sustainability standards applicable to Fortescue. ¹ Effective 1 July 2024, Sustainability forms part of a new Board Committee, the Safety and Sustainability Committee.  ===== PAGE 64 ===== Our approach to sustainability FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    60 MEASURING OUR  PERFORMANCE AMBITION TARGET PERFORMANCE RESULT Safety and wellbeing To be a global leader in safety Achieve zero  fatalities Reduce Fortescue  Metal's injury profile by  15 per cent year on year Maintain or improve Fortescue  Metal’s TRIFR year on year TRIFR not exceeding 4.0   for Fortescue Energy Fatalities Injury profile reduction  (Fortescue Metals) TRIFR (Fortescue Metals) TRIFR (Fortescue Energy) FY24   0 FY24   25%   FY24   1.3   FY24  0.5   FY23   0 FY23  22% FY23    1.8   FY23   0.0        FY22   1 FY22    21%   FY22    1.8   FY22   0.7     PEOPLE Diversity, inclusion and equity continued To increase the number of First Nations Australian employees to be reflective of general society, and to provide  opportunities for First Nations Australian people to move into leadership positions.

Climate change is the greatest challenge facing the global  community. It also presents a once in a lifetime opportunity  for economic growth and value creation.  Climate change has the potential to lead to catastrophic  social and economic outcomes, the costs of which far  exceed those associated with transitioning to a low carbon  world. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC)’s Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) found that without  deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions over the  coming decades, global warming will exceed 2°C in the 21st  century.  Without immediate action to reduce global emissions, the  impacts of climate change, which are already being felt, will  continue to worsen. Swift action from industry and strong  policy frameworks from governments are required, where  risk taking is incentivised and rewarded and the rights of our  communities are protected.  Strong action to address climate change is embedded  within the Fortescue business and is led by our Executive  Chairman, Dr Andrew Forrest AO, and our Board.  Fortescue has a costed plan to decarbonise our Scope 1  and 2 emissions across our terrestrial Australian iron ore  operations, while developing projects and technology to help  scale green energy and green hydrogen. We will decarbonise profitably by lowering operating costs,  future proofing our business and creating new revenue  streams. As consumers and customers look to reduce their  own carbon footprint, the demand for green iron ore, green  metal and green steel will increase. We move beyond our own operations, investing in  technology to reduce emissions globally and share green  fuels and technology with the world.  At our R&D facilities, we are working to decarbonise  industry, including Fortescue’s operations, using battery  power, green hydrogen and green ammonia. By far the largest source of our Scope 3 emissions is the  steelmaking process. We are investing in the development  of green metal reduction and processing technologies to  demonstrate green metal feasibility, with the ambition to  show that our iron ore is compatible with low-emissions  iron-making processes. We are also pursuing the  opportunity to jointly develop a fully integrated Australia– China green metal supply chain. climate change Report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    66 Our approach CLIMATE CHANGE  REPORT  ===== PAGE 71 ===== climate change  report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    67 Operating and   financial review Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Financial report Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Overview About this  report This report has been prepared for Fortescue’s stakeholders and details  our progress in managing climate-related matters, including risks and  opportunities.  It is aligned with the recommendations of the Taskforce on  Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which has  guided our climate-related reporting since FY18. During FY24, the Australian Treasury issued a draft of new  government policy for climate change reporting, as well  as a draft bill proposing changes to legislation to enact  that policy. Under this new regime, the measurement and  disclosure of climate-related financial information will be  guided by Australian Sustainability Reporting Standard  (ASRS) ED-SR1 issued by the Australian Accounting  Standards Board (AASB). Effective from FY26, ASRS ED-SR1  is based on the TCFD recommendations. While we are still reporting under TCFD, we are preparing  our business for ASRS compliance, and this report contains  some elements of additional disclosures required under  ED-SR1.

We expect decarbonisation to drive value for our  shareholders. By 2030, decarbonisation will enable  Fortescue to save over 700 million litres of diesel and 15  million gigajoules of gas, avoiding 3mtCO2-e each year. This  will generate significant cost savings and reduce Fortescue’s  exposure to volatility in oil and gas prices. In September 2023, we made a commitment to stop  purchasing voluntary carbon offsets. Instead, we redirect  the funds allocated to purchase voluntary offsets into our  1 3 2 Decarbonising Fortescue:  Fortescue’s ambitions and  actions, in either our own  operations or value chain,   in the short-, medium- and  long-term, to reduce our   greenhouse gas emissions.

In FY24, several hundred million  dollars, which would have been spent on purchased offsets,  was instead allocated to decarbonisation. We believe practical, technology and policy-driven solutions  are key to managing the impacts of climate change. We  understand that climate change and the transition to net  zero presents both risks and opportunities to our business  and that it has the potential to impact our entire value  chain, operations, assets and the communities in which we  operate. We are implementing measures to mitigate and  manage these risks while maximising opportunities and  using these assessments to inform business strategies and  provide certainty to stakeholders that we will continue to  thrive in a net zero economy.  ===== PAGE 75 ===== climate change  report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    71 Operating and   financial review Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Financial report Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Overview Decarbonising  our iron ore  operations Fortescue has a costed plan to decarbonise our Scope  1 and 2 emissions across our terrestrial Australian iron  ore operations by 2030. In September 2022, Fortescue  announced a US$6.2 billion capital investment to  decarbonise our Pilbara operations. We have identified  solutions to eliminate approximately 90 per cent of  terrestrial Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our Australian iron  ore operations and are actively working to identify solutions  for the final 10 per cent. The decarbonisation of our own operations centres around  investing in renewable energy and using it to eliminate  the use of diesel and gas in our Australian iron ore  operations. Fortescue Zero will be a key enabler through  the development and supply of a range of green technology  products. As part of our strategy to achieve Real Zero Scope 1  and 2 by 2030 for our Australian iron ore operations, we  are focusing on three interconnected decarbonisation  workstreams: green energy supply, green mobility, and  green systems and optimisation.  green energy   supply green mobility green systems &  optimisation Renewable   generation Heavy mobile  equipment Other small emitters Energy balance plan   & model Transmission &  distribution Site power  reticulation &  infrastructure People & skills Remote energy  balance schedule   and control Storage Rail Demand response Shipping VLOC   & tugs¹ ¹ Capital expenditure relating to decarbonisation of shipping VLOC and tugs is excluded from Fortescue’s Board approved September 2022 announcement.  ===== PAGE 76 ===== climate change Report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    72 Green mobility Fortescue is committed to developing zero-emission  solutions to replace diesel-powered mine, port and rail  equipment. The majority of this equipment will be electric or  battery electric powered by our renewable energy system.  In FY24, the team continued to design solution pathways  consisting of both ‘off-the-shelf’ products and new  technologies via collaborations and partnerships with world- leading original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), including  Liebherr.  FY24 milestones include: •	 Onsite trials of our first prototype battery electric haul  truck, Roadrunner, concluded at Christmas Creek mine  site exceeding the performance expectations of the  battery power system while carrying 231 tonnes of iron  ore. Roadrunner brings several surface mining firsts,  including the ability to fast charge in 30 minutes and  capacity to capture and store regenerated power as it  drives downhill. •	 Commissioning and site-based testing of a 3MW  prototype fast charger for battery electric haul trucks at  Christmas Creek. •	 Commissioning of three Liebherr R 9400 E electric  excavators at our Cloudbreak and Solomon mine sites,  each having moved over 1 million tonnes in their first four  operational months. These are powered by the grid via  6.6kV substations, switchgear and more than 2km of high  voltage trailing cable.  •	 A prototype hydrogen fuel cell electric truck, Europa,  completed testing in Perth and is now undergoing site- based commissioning at Christmas Creek. •	 Commissioning and site-based testing of a prototype  Offboard Power Unit, which can power a Liebherr R 9400  E electric excavator that Fortescue Zero retrofitted from  a diesel unit, using onboard hydrogen and batteries as a  zero-emission fuel source, at Christmas Creek.  •	 Mainline trials of a dual-fuelled prototype ammonia- powered locomotive at Solomon mine site, completing  eight banking trial runs with no incidents.  •	 Procurement of two battery electric locomotives from  Progress Rail, which are currently under construction  and due to be delivered for mainline rail testing in FY25.  Fortescue Zero’s battery electric locomotive prototype is  also under construction.  •	 At Solomon, we powered a dewatering well for the first  time for a period entirely from solar energy as part of  microgrid development. Microgrids will replace remote,  diesel generation where loads cannot be connected to the  main grid by 2030. •	 Opening of a new state-of-the-art Fortescue Zero  technical innovation centre in Kidlington, UK, to focus  on the technical development, testing and prototype  production of batteries and zero emission powertrains  for a wide range of applications, including motorsports,  mining haul trucks, and other off-road and automotive  applications.  Green energy supply We are making significant investments in renewable power,  battery storage and high voltage transmission to replace  stationary diesel, gas-fired power generation at our sites, as  well as the diesel consumed in our mobile equipment. In FY24, Fortescue completed the construction of a 100MW  solar farm at North Star Junction, located near Iron Bridge.  North Star Junction Solar Farm is expected to produce more  than 250GWh per year, which represents more than 30 per  cent of our forecast FY25 energy demand for Iron Bridge  facility. North Star Junction Solar complements the 60MW  solar farm commissioned in 2021 as part of the Chichester  Solar Gas Hybrid Facility.  In FY24, Fortescue commenced construction on the high  voltage transmission line between our Solomon and Eliwana  mine sites, to complement the existing Pilbara Energy  Connect transmission infrastructure which connects  Solomon and Iron Bridge. By 2028 we aim to have all our  mines and renewable generation assets interconnected into  a single power grid. Our ambition is that by the end of calendar year 2030,   100 per cent of our electricity demand will be met by  renewable sources. Detailed power system modelling  suggests we will need at least 2-3GW of wind and solar,  supported by battery storage, to satisfy our energy needs  with renewables. The build-out of our renewable energy  assets will be matched to the deployment of green HME  to ensure a balance between energy supply and demand  during this transition period to 2030. In FY24, the Fortescue Board approved investment in  developing an additional 130MW solar farm and two battery  energy storage systems with total capacity of 270MWh. We  are concurrently undertaking feasibility and design studies  for further large-scale solar, wind, battery and transmission  infrastructure projects to build out our green energy system  and connect renewable energy generation to our mining  operations.  In FY24, we continued to work with community stakeholders  for land access and approval pathways for these and  future projects and anticipate additional wind and solar  projects will be ready for FID within the next two to three  years. Securing access to land to build our renewable  energy infrastructure involves navigating the complex and  changing regulatory requirements of local, state and federal  government. We are currently investigating opportunities  to sell excess renewable energy to support others reducing  their emissions.  ===== PAGE 77 ===== climate change  report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    73 Operating and   financial review Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Financial report Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Overview The Green Mobility group is also identifying solutions to  replace diesel generators, light vehicles, support mining  equipment and working with onsite contracting partners  to align on a pathway to successfully transition their fleets.  A suite of trials for validating battery electric light vehicles,  support mining equipment and electrical infrastructure are  planned throughout 2024 and 2025. To date, the Fortescue Board has approved significant  capital investment to decarbonise its heavy mobile  fleet, including battery electric haul trucks, graders,  tracked dozers, electric excavators and associated site  infrastructure such as charging facilities and electric  cables. In total, Fortescue will replace over 700 units of  heavy mobile equipment as well as our mainline rail with  zero emission solutions over the next six years to 2030.  Some equipment will be developed through Fortescue Zero  working with OEMs, with Fortescue Zero developing the  zero emission power train. Other equipment, such as cabled  electric excavators, are commercially available already. Green systems and operations Fortescue is committed to operating its future decarbonised  mining assets and power grid safely, reliably and efficiently  in order to maximise value from the significant capital  investment.  Throughout the remainder of the decade, Fortescue's  power system will undergo a transformative shift from  a conventional, thermal generator-supplied grid to  one targeting 100 per cent Inverter-Based Resource  (IBR) penetration and very significant energy storage  capacity. Fortescue’s load profile is also changing with  the electrification of mining fleet, most notably the  introduction of battery electric haul trucks and their high  voltage charging stations. The scale and pace of this  transition requires world-leading solutions for ensuring both  continuous grid stability and optimal energy management.  The rapid transition in physical assets brings associated  variability in renewable energy availability and this  necessitates an equivalent evolution of the digital  technologies and systems used for Fortescue’s  mining and supply chain planning as well as real-time  operational control. The Green Systems workstream in  the Decarbonisation program is tasked with designing  and implementing these changes, working closely with  Fortescue Zero and partners such as the National Renewable  Energy Laboratory (NREL) in the USA plus leading vendors  to develop and deploy cutting edge digital solutions. FY24 milestones include: •	 Defining the future energy aware planning processes  for effective decision making over long, medium and  near-term horizons with a 100 per cent renewable energy  powered operation. •	 Defining the control systems strategy for the  decarbonised power grid and associated electrified  mining equipment. •	 Jointly developing with NREL an industry-leading bespoke  modelling platform to simulate and optimise modern  power grids.   ===== PAGE 78 ===== climate change Report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    74 Decarbonising our  value chain Fortescue’s second strategic pillar is reducing emissions in our  value chain, requiring us to address downstream Scope 3 emissions,  including those from our iron and steel customers, together with  upstream Scope 3 emissions from our supply chain. Among our value chain Scope 3 emissions, upstream  emissions represent approximately three per cent (including  one per cent from purchased goods and services and one  per cent from shipping), while downstream processing of  sold product (Category 10) represents more than 97 per cent  in FY24. Hence, we prioritise engagement with customers  and investments in technology improvement to achieve low- emission processing of iron ore. Downstream emissions (our  customers) During FY24, we transported 191.6 million tonnes of iron ore  to customers. To meet our Scope 3 targets of enabling a 7.5 per cent  reduction in steelmaking emissions intensity by 2030  relative to FY21 levels and net zero by 2040, Fortescue is  collaborating with partners and investing in technology and  R&D to reduce the significant carbon emissions that come  from the shipping and processing of our iron ore. We are conducting R&D both in-house and in collaboration  with steel mill businesses, global engineering companies  and research institutions. We are a founding member of  the Heavy Industry Low-carbon Transition Cooperative  Research Centre (HILT CRC). This venture brings together  industries, researchers, and government organisations in  an effort to de-risk the technology pathways to decarbonise  heavy industry. In addition to our yearly partnership  contributions, Fortescue also engages further via in-kind  contributions to the partnership's various projects. Fortescue is currently progressing studies on the  development of commercial-scale green metal production,  both in Australia and abroad. Our work to convert   low grade hematite ore into low-carbon green metal at a  commercial scale is central to our efforts to reduce   Scope 3 emissions. The Green Metal Project at Christmas  Creek will demonstrate that Fortescue’s suite of iron ores  from the Pilbara can be processed into green metal. The introduction of Iron Bridge is the largest contributor to  our overall emissions reduction in the near term, with it’s  ramp-up contributing up to two to three per cent reduction  in our emissions intensity by FY30. In addition, potential  for higher grade iron ore products from the Belinga Project  in Gabon could support an improved Fortescue product  portfolio offering that supports reduced Scope 3 emissions  intensity. This outcome is conditional on the development   of the project. The evaluation of downstream processing   of lower grade iron ore into green metal, which has now  begun, is an important initiative with the potential to reduce  Scope 3 emissions.  Shipping Our commitment to address Scope 3 emissions also  includes a target to enable a reduction in emissions intensity  levels from the shipping of our iron ore by 50 per cent, from  FY21 levels by 2030. In FY24, Fortescue demonstrated the  use of ammonia for shipping on the Green Pioneer vessel.  We aim for all Fortescue’s own ore carriers to be powered  by green fuels by 2030. We are proactively engaging with  the shipping industry to promote a transition to ammonia- powered vessels. Our engagement with shipping suppliers includes interim  measures to identify and charter low-emission vessels  (greenhouse gas ratings of A-D), targeting vessels which  are equipped with energy-saving devices, optimising vessel  and fleet size, using eco steam performing vessels, and  optimising schedules for just-in-time arrivals.   ===== PAGE 79 ===== climate change  report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    75 Operating and   financial review Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Financial report Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Overview Upstream emissions (our supply  chain) In FY23, we established a dedicated Decarbonisation  Project Management Office within our Contracting  and Procurement function, to identify and progress  decarbonisation opportunities in our supply chain. This  team is also integrating climate change requirements  into Fortescue’s source-to-contract process and building  internal capability to support our Decarbonisation Program. In FY24, we continued to focus on education and  capability building with our onsite contractors to meet  our 2030 targets at our Australian iron ore operations.  Our Decarbonisation Project Management Office  engaged directly with 77 strategic suppliers about our  Decarbonisation Program and how to start developing  their own roadmap to Real Zero. We also established a  decarbonisation portal to share updates with our onsite  contractors. Key suppliers have been required to submit  decarbonisation plans. We are working to improve our standard contract templates  to clearly communicate our minimum expectations and  reporting requirements with our suppliers to align with site  decarbonisation timelines. Our tender submissions also  include a request for product carbon footprint data and  emission profiles of equipment supplied. We intend to launch  new emissions contract clauses and introduce performance  metrics into strategic categories next year. In FY25, we will begin developing our targeted strategy for  reducing Scope 3 emissions in our upstream supply chain. In  preparation for this work, we invited our active suppliers to  a decarbonisation information session hosted by the World  Economic Forum in May 2024. For high-risk sourcing activities, our commercial strategies  focus on supply chain transparency to assess and validate  risk. Our award criteria consider sustainability, along with  price, quality and schedule. We prioritise suppliers who align  with our Values and commit to working collaboratively with  us to deliver sustainability outcomes in our shared supply  chains. We believe that genuine partnerships and commitment  to shared sustainability objectives with our suppliers lead to  opportunities for innovation, proactive risk identification and  mitigation, more effective remediation mechanisms, improved  supply chain resilience, and competitiveness in the market. Case Study CONTINENTAL  INDUSTRY Fortescue collaborated with conveyor belt supplier,  Continental Industry, to complete an emission mapping  study, comparing two types of conveyor belts. Multiple  stakeholders supported the study, both internal Fortescue  teams and external Continental Industry teams.  Fortescue recognises that reducing Scope 3 emissions is  a challenge that cannot be tackled in isolation. Proactively  engaging with our supply chain to reduce and remove  upstream emissions is essential. As part of this journey, we  educated our suppliers, conducted internal evaluations, and  employed life cycle assessment (LCA) methodologies and  tools to assess the environmental impact of products and  processes.  The LCA-based assessment compared the decarbonisation  potential of Continental’s Conveyor Belts with Low Rolling  Resistance Covers (CV917) (‘Low Rolling Resistance  Conveyor’) vs. Standard Conveyor (CV913) (‘Standard  Conveyor’). Evaluations considered raw material input (kg)  and operational energy efficiency (kWh).  Overall, the Low Rolling Resistance Conveyor demonstrated  greater decarbonisation potential than the Standard  Conveyor. Additionally, during the trial, Fortescue observed  lower wear rates with the Low Rolling Resistance Conveyor,  which indicate reduction in change outs and extended  product life span.  Fortescue is strategically reducing emissions by developing  strong relationships with supply chain partners and  integrating life cycle thinking into decision-making  processes.  ===== PAGE 80 ===== climate change Report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    76 Contributing to  an economy-wide  transition We are seeking to make a significant and strategic  contribution to accelerating the global transition to a   zero-emissions economy. As an integrated green  technology, energy and metals business, we offer a suite  of zero-emissions products and technologies to support  industrial decarbonisation. Our goal to eliminate fossil fuels from our Australian  terrestrial iron ore operations and value chain is driving  innovation in a suite of new decarbonisation technologies  that we are developing through Fortescue Zero and  elsewhere. In turn, we expect that we will be able to  market these technologies, and our wider expertise in  decarbonising industry, to support other industry players to  implement and fast-track their climate transition strategies,  thereby making a strategic and economy-wide contribution.  To encourage decarbonisation of industry beyond our own  operations and to facilitate an economy-wide transition, it is  essential to advance the adoption of renewable energy and  clean fuels, particularly green hydrogen. Fortescue has focused R&D and investment on early-stage  technology as key enablers to making these energy projects  more economically attractive, including innovations across  solar, wind and battery technology, through means of  Fortescue-led R&D, venture capital funding, partnerships,  seed funding or acquisitions. This innovation focus and  investment also extends beyond the project components  themselves into the application and use of this energy,  including downstream energy carriers and end-use  applications that have potential to redefine paradigms  across multiple industries. A key strategic focus as part of  this downstream application is scaling the conversion of iron  ore into green metal, using hydrogen as a reductant. Fortescue has a substantial opportunity to demonstrate  commercially viable technology, leveraging our innovation  to support green energy transition, and attracting further  investment in our green products and decarbonisation  technologies. We are working to develop the green  technologies for trucks, trains, planes, ships, electrolysers,  solar, cables, wind, batteries, hydrogen fuel cells and the  digital industry. Our values of generating ideas, stretch  targets and empowerment foster an embedded culture of  innovation across our workforce, placing our company at the  forefront of technological development.

A just transition  ===== PAGE 84 ===== climate change Report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    80 Climate- related risks Climate change is a material risk for Fortescue and  has been consistently represented as such since the  commencement of our formal corporate social responsibility  and sustainability disclosures in 2017. In 2020, we began  standalone reporting on climate change, reflecting the  importance of this issue to our business.  Building on our long-term understanding of climate- related risks and opportunities, we have further refined our  understanding of the potential implications of a changing  climate. This year, Fortescue has performed its first  sustainability double materiality assessment to support a  refresh in our strategy and to cast a greater spotlight on our  sustainability-related issues, including climate change.  Physical risks Physical climate risks arise from the direct or indirect  impacts of changing climate and extreme weather events.  Increasing temperatures and the prevalence of extreme  weather events such as heatwaves, droughts and bushfires  can disrupt operations, damage infrastructure and challenge  supply chains. These conditions can lead to higher  operational costs, reduced productivity and potential losses  in revenue. Additionally, changes in precipitation patterns  and the increased frequency of intense rainfall events  heighten the risk of flooding, which can damage assets,  disrupt operations and lead to repairs and downtime. Coastal  assets are vulnerable to sea level rise and storm surges. Bushfires present a significant hazard in the Pilbara region,  particularly during the summer months from November  to April. This period corresponds with the region's hot and  dry season, characterised by high temperatures and low  humidity. Climate change will have an impact on fire weather  patterns, especially the pattern of heavy rain promoting  vegetation growth followed by dry periods that create  abundant fuel, which can significantly heighten the risk and  intensity of bushfires. Dry lightning, which occurs when thunderstorms produce  lightning strikes with little to no rainfall, creates ideal  conditions for igniting bushfires. Between November 2023  and January 2024, storms with lightning strikes and dry  conditions resulted in a total of 48 days of bushfires at the  Eliwana mine site. This level of bushfire exposure is unusually  high, partly due to drier-than-normal climatic conditions  and our reduced ability to implement preventative burning  controls during cooler times of the year. Severe temperatures in locations where we operate can  also create a hazard. Temperatures are already extreme in  the northern part of Western Australia – and always have  been. However, temperatures are increasing and the state  endured one of its hottest summers on record this year with  temperatures 1.56°C above the 30-year average from 1991  to 2020. Several record maximum daily temperatures were  broken across the state.  Gabon, while not as hot, experiences humid conditions,  which will be an important consideration for managing  health and safety risks at the Belinga Project. Exposure to  excessive heat, particularly in humid conditions, can lead  to heat-related illness in our workforce working outside.  Climate change will increase the risk, and studies suggest  that, for every 1°C the planet warms, humidity rises by about  7 per cent. Increasing humidity can have significant impacts  as the upper limit of our bodies to deal with heat decreases  in high humidity, with heat stroke (the most severe form of  heat illness) becoming possible from as low as 31-35°C in  humid conditions.  The results from this assessment provided a framework for  a more granular analysis on how these material climate- related risks are managed across our business. With this  approach, we continue to consider the outward social and  environmental impacts associated with our activities, as  well as the sustainability-related risks and opportunities  impacting our financial performance. Full details of this  assessment are provided in our FY24 Sustainability  Materiality Report available on our website at fortescue.com. An overview of climate-related physical and transition risks is  presented below.   ===== PAGE 85 ===== climate change  report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    81 Operating and   financial review Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Financial report Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Overview Climate-related physical risks RISK DETAIL STRATEGIC RESPONSE Damage to assets or operational disruptions resulting from the increasing occurrence of climate-related hazard events Our asset portfolio is exposed to climate- related hazards, potentially causing material  damage and/or production delays to our  mining and rail operations and connecting  infrastructure, leading to operational  disruptions, impacts to production rates and  increased capital costs associated with asset  repair. There is also the risk of disruptions to  overhead line assets due to lightning.  Global sea level rise coupled with storm  surge has the potential to cause material  damage to our port infrastructure and green  energy production facilities located within  proximity of watercourses/ coastlines through  inundation, with extreme winds potentially  causing port closures and evacuation of ships,  significantly disrupting freight schedules.  Fortescue is focused on building resilience into operations to protect  assets and minimise operational downtime from extreme weather  events.  We have constructed our port, rail and mine infrastructure to meet  engineering specifications, accounting for the future risk of extreme  weather events by considering current industry standards, including the  Australian Rainfall and Runoff Guidelines and the Standard Engineering  Specification for Drainage and Flood Protection. Infrastructure is  designed to have various levels of flood immunity depending on the  criticality and life of the asset. We continue to work closely with the Pilbara Ports Authority and other  operators to minimise impacts to ship movements during extreme  weather events in Port Hedland in line with emergency management  procedures. Recognising the critical nature of the port operations and  risks arising from a changing climate, we endeavour to strengthen this  relationship to further enhance our understanding of possible future  scenarios to develop robust adaptation strategies. To ensure the resilience of our operations into the future, we conduct  climate change assessments on hydrology (rainfall and flood risk)  as a standard activity on all project studies in Fortescue Energy and  undertake sensitivity assessments of facility floor levels, drainage  infrastructure and flood mitigation measures against climate change  affected storm events.  Supply chain disruptions and delays Climate change impacts can also be felt  throughout our supply chains. Flooding,  heatwaves, storms or bushfires can disrupt  supplier production or impact transportation  corridors, which can cause delays.  Fortescue works with its transport providers to establish alternative  routes or transport modes in case of road closures due to storms, flooding  or bushfires. Where possible, inventory is transferred between Fortescue's  sites to reduce risk to assets and ensure continuity of operations. Fortescue has an established network of transport providers available to  service our logistics requirements. Our contracted logistics vendors are  monitored in their performance with agreed insurances to further mitigate  risk.  We continuously explore opportunities to optimise existing supply  sources and identify alternative sources for critical goods and services  to diversify our supply chain. We also actively work to secure resources  within our control in order to strengthen the resilience of our operations’  logistics and critical services against supply disruptions.  ===== PAGE 86 ===== climate change Report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    82 RISK DETAIL STRATEGIC RESPONSE Increased worker health and safety risks Climate change impacts can result in illness,  potential loss of life or loss of production.  Extreme heat can lead to heat stress, which  can put employee safety at risk and disrupt  operations. Heat stress or stroke can cause  the worker to seek medical attention and take  time from work to recuperate. In severe cases,  exposure to extreme heat may even cause  death. Fortescue has always operated in areas that are impacted by severe  weather events, extreme temperatures and bushfire risk, and we have  controls in place to manage these risks which will be more widely used if  impacts become more severe.  We manage the risk to the health and safety of our people, including  onsite contractors, by implementing a number of hazard control  standards and management procedures detailing requirements for  effective prevention, preparedness and response for hazards such as  extreme weather, flooding and cyclones.  We implement a Bushfire Risk Management program across all our sites  which focuses on the protection of people and key assets/infrastructure,  including fire buffer zones for each asset. The program incorporates  the use of prescribed burning to reduce fuel loads and minimise the  frequency, intensity and duration of bushfires.  Heat stress and vector or waterborne diseases, which includes potential  exposure to biological contaminants, are managed through our Fortescue  Health Standard and relevant procedures to ensure preventative  measures are adopted. Tailings storage facility failure Climate change impacts, such as increased  precipitation and/or storm intensities, have  the potential to place increased stress on  tailings storage facilities. The impacts may  also challenge operational assumptions about  water management and associated controls  for mitigating the risk of facility failure. Our tailings management strategy is a risk-based approach to ensure  there are appropriate controls in place to mitigate risk of tailings storage  facility (TSF) failure, including assessment and provision for climate  change. Our TSF designs utilise risk-based design criteria such that the  risk of failure is as low as reasonably practical (ALARP). This includes  allowance of water management on our facilities up to the probable  maximum flood (PMF) event with allowances for increasing storm  intensities due to climate change. This is applied throughout operations  and planned for in closure. Vulnerability to water-stress The potential for prolonged drought events or  changes to precipitation patterns may place  increasing stress on the availability of water  resources required for mining operations  and green energy production. This may delay  approvals, lead to more stringent controls and  impact relationships with local stakeholders.  Reduced water availability (surface water and/ or groundwater) may impact on hydrogen  production, and drawdown of groundwater/ reduction in surface water flows may increase  potential for environmental impacts and/or  downstream/surrounding users. Our water strategy is focused on reducing water usage across our  operations. This includes assessing technological solutions and  identifying metrics and internal performance standards to manage water  scarcity potential. We take a risk-based approach towards ensuring secure water supply  and managing climate-related risks for each of our operations. Water  sources providing operational water supply that may be impacted by  changing climate are considered by assessing different (dry and/or wet)  climate scenarios. This informs us whether these water sources can meet  operational water demand and whether additional or alternative water  sources are required.  We also assess the extent to which prolonged droughts may place  additional stress on mine water supplies, which may increase the risk of  non-compliance with environmental approvals.  We incorporate drought conditions into water supply assessments during  evaluation of new projects, and we have included consideration of water  supply availability risk into our standardised risk module library to inform  internal project evaluation.  ===== PAGE 87 ===== climate change  report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    83 Operating and   financial review Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Financial report Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Overview RAIL BUCKLING  AND DERAILMENT  INCIDENT   CASE STUDY Transition risks Transitioning to a low-carbon economy involves extensive  changes in policies, laws, technologies, and markets to meet  climate change mitigation and adaptation requirements.  The nature, speed, and focus of these changes can create  transition risks that pose challenges for organisations.  For many, transition risks focus on challenges associated  with requirements to decarbonise and keep pace with global  developments. We are already investing heavily in green  energy and decarbonisation, demonstrating that change is  possible. Our transition risks also include challenges with  respect to supply and demand timing for our technology  and energy solutions and anticipating emerging and  developing regulatory requirements.  We continuously navigate market and technological changes  and adapt to evolving regulatory landscapes to maintain a  competitive edge and respond to enhanced sustainability  requirements. As countries and vulnerable communities  increasingly contend with accelerating climate impacts,  there is an elevated risk of social and policy tipping points  that may drive the introduction of tighter climate regulations.  By continuing to innovate, embracing sustainable practices  and aligning strategies with evolving market demands, we  can minimise our risks and capitalise on opportunities.  Dampier Bunbury Gas Pipeline Cloudbreak Christmas Creek Eliwana WESTERN HUB Solomon CHICHESTER HUB NYIDINGHU IRON BRIDGE Karratha Dampier Roebourne Marble Bar Nullagine Tom Price Port Hedland HERB ELLIOTT  PORT Canning Basin Fortescue’s climate change strategy includes a focus on  building resilience into our operations and protecting assets  to minimise operational downtime from extreme weather  events.  Fortescue’s three mining hubs in the Pilbara are connected  to our port facility by 760km of rail. In December 2023, a  heat-related buckle in our railway line led to a derailment  and damage of ore cars, about 150km south of Port Hedland. On that day, the Marble Bar weather station recorded a  maximum temperature of 49.3°C at 3.56pm, marking one of  the hottest December days in Western Australia on record. The wagons were empty when they derailed and there were  no injuries recorded. However, the derailment impacted  supply of iron ore to our port operations for 78 hours. Accelerated re-rail program Our Rail Maintenance team has already been implementing  an accelerated re-rail program as part of our standard  rail maintenance procedures. With annual expenditures  of approximately A$50 million, the program focuses on  rectifying identified track defects to manage our asset.  As part of this program, and in specific response to the  incident, an internal investigation was launched into the  impacts of extreme heat on the railway infrastructure to  review and quantify our maintenance strategy and to better  understand the various interacting causal factors leading to  heat-related buckle. The investigation results were verified  by an independent technical expert team from Monash  University, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of our  findings and actions.  The learnings derived from this investigation have informed  our modelling and risk assessment processes, supporting a  more holistic approach to maintenance practices including  those that consider the potential for increased likelihood  and severity of extreme weather events that may eventuate  as a result of climate change.  DERAILMENT  LOCATION  ===== PAGE 88 ===== climate change Report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    84 Climate-related transition risks RISK DETAIL STRATEGIC RESPONSE Existing and emerging policy and regulatory demands resulting from a global goal to decarbonise Evolving policy and regulatory  changes are a material risk for  Fortescue, including regulatory  uncertainty in relation to green  hydrogen and ammonia.  There is also ambiguity and lack of  global alignment of the definition  of what is considered to be a  green fuel. Inconsistent guidance  across jurisdictions can lead to  misalignment with stakeholder  expectations, challenges in  reporting, and difficulties in selling  ‘green’ fuels. We closely monitor policy and regulatory developments and regularly conduct  scenario analysis to anticipate potential regulatory changes impacting projects and  the ability to source compliant fuels.  We proactively engage with government bodies, regulators and industry associations  to influence favourable policy and regulatory outcomes and advocate for global  mutual recognition in the various markets and reporting standards. For more  information about our engagement strategy, including engagement and advocacy  activities with industry and government, please refer to our Climate Transition Plan,  available on our website at fortescue.com. We understand that investors  are increasingly prioritising  sustainability criteria when making  investment decisions, resulting in  elevated pressures to comply with  complex standards to maintain  investor confidence and ensure  access to capital.  Fortescue has extensive engagement with shareholders, lenders and the investment  community on sustainability matters to ensure it is transparent in its approach and  that investors areas of concern are understood. ASX Releases, investor and analyst  briefings and the Annual Reporting suite are important channels to communicate  and report on Fortescue's approach to sustainability. In November 2023, we launched Fortescue Capital, headquartered in New York City,  as a new green energy investment platform and an integral next step in Fortescue’s  commitment to deliver green energy projects and decarbonisation investments.  As a fiduciary of third party capital, we must not only meet our own rigorous ESG  standards, but also the requirements and expectations of our investors. These  institutional investors – typically pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, foundations  and endowments – are known for their exemplary commitment to sustainability  and ESG principles, often regarded as the gold standard in the industry. This dual  sensitivity fosters a culture of accountability and continuous improvement. Emerging technologies and technical viability of decarbonisation We accept that there are, and will be  in the future, technical challenges  related to decarbonisation. The  achievement of our decarbonisation  targets depends on Fortescue’s  success in integrating new zero  emission technologies into existing  operations in an accelerated  timeframe. This could lead to  unforeseen operational issues  impacting production. Fortescue is rapidly adapting and applying existing technologies in new ways and  working with OEMs to develop and deploy entirely new technology in our operations.  Integrating new zero-emission technologies into existing operations is complex. It  involves replacing or evolving legacy systems and establishing new robust operating  systems as we introduce intermittent renewable energy sources and battery storage  to power a new electrified fleet. To ensure seamless integration and mitigate any  potential risks, we are testing all zero-emission technology in our own operations  under controlled conditions before broader deployment.  We continue to work with leading technology providers to minimise all risks  associated with technology performance as well as the integration of such  technology into an existing operating environment.  As a first-mover company we face  the transition risk of balancing  the protection of our intellectual  property (IP) to maintain a  competitive edge with the need to  share knowledge to drive industry- wide progress.  Successfully navigating conflicting dynamics is essential for Fortescue to lead in  innovation and global decarbonisation efforts.  Fortescue Hydrogen Systems (FHS) leverages its ability to rapidly prototype,  enabling fast turnaround times for inventions, which in turn facilitates the rapid  analysis of commercial and technical viability in practice. This ability ensures that  invention disclosures are quickly converted into patent applications, maintaining  an agile approach to protecting the IP generated. FHS has also actively segregated  business units developing individual components with high-value IP.  Fortescue Zero manages competitive technology and IP risk on a case-by-case  basis, ensuring a suitable approach depending on the nature of the IP whilst ensuring  collaboration with external partners. Additionally, we conduct market intelligence to identify future technologies and  baseline the current performance of our internal product development, ensuring we  remain at the forefront of the industry.  ===== PAGE 89 ===== climate change  report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    85 Operating and   financial review Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Financial report Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Overview RISK DETAIL STRATEGIC RESPONSE We rely on the future availability  of a workforce proficient in  advanced green technologies,  renewable energy systems and  hydrogen production. The current  labour market has a limited  supply of skilled professionals in  these emerging fields, and the  intense competition for talent  in the renewable energy sector  further exacerbates the challenge  of attracting and retaining the  necessary expertise. We are in a unique position as a vertically integrated green metals, technology and  energy business. Our people operate across the full value chain and are excited  to be developing new technology, testing new systems, and rethinking the way  traditional mining operations are powered and run. Strengthening our brand through  showcasing decarbonisation initiatives and fostering a supportive work environment  further distinguishes us as an employer of choice in the sector.  Our commitment to pioneering decarbonisation practices positions us as an  employer of choice for professionals seeking to contribute to transformative  environmental initiatives. Guided by our Workforce Transition Strategy launched  internally earlier this year, we are heavily investing in our people through  apprenticeships, nationally recognised qualifications, OEM training and in- house developed training packages, fostering internal capability development  opportunities and demonstrating a commitment to career growth in renewable  energy.  For Scope 3, there is a risk that  technology and policy do not keep  pace with our decarbonisation  ambition. In addition, some of our  customers might not transition  to low-carbon technologies and  practices at the necessary pace. Meeting Scope 3 decarbonisation  targets involves overcoming major  technical obstacles to produce  green steel, including application  of hydrogen-based processes  and renewable energy integration.  These innovations require  addressing significant engineering  challenges related to optimising  efficiency, ensuring reliability, and  achieving scalable deployment. Without technology changes, limited Scope 3 reductions are achievable. Fortescue is  actively developing and scaling several zero emission reduction and electric smelting  technologies to show that change is possible.  The adoption of hydrogen-based technologies in green metal production offers a  pathway to decarbonise the steelmaking process. The production of green metal  using hydrogen as a reducing agent, instead of carbon-based sources like coke in  traditional blast furnaces, significantly reduces carbon emissions in the production  of steel. This process, known as hydrogen direct reduction, emits water vapour rather  than carbon dioxide. Most of the iron and steelmaking technology development to date has focused  on the processing of ultra high-grade iron ores, which comprise a small portion  of global production. Fortescue’s iron ores, and those of Australian producers in  general, require a different technological solution for processing into emission-free  iron and steel. Fortescue is mitigating the risk of implementing relatively unproven  commercial-scale technologies by fast-tracking pilot projects such as the Green  Metal Project, which aims to produce its first green metal in 2025. This project will  test the technologies needed for the production of green metal using Australian iron  ores which are not ultra high-grade. Shifts and uncertainties in market demand for our commodities, products and services The global push towards reducing  carbon emissions and enhancing  sustainability may alter demand  patterns in the steel industry. The  rise of green steel production may  demand different types or grades  of iron ore, potentially reducing  the need for traditional iron ore  products. We maintain strong relationships with our customers to ensure supplies of iron ore  meet their expectations in terms of quality, consistency and reliability of supply. Fortescue produces a range of products, with several higher quality, and lower  emissions products, including our new magnetite product from Iron Bridge, as well as  hematite products including Kings Fines, West Pilbara Fines and Fortescue Lump. Diversification of Fortescue’s product offering buffers uncertainties in market  demand and allows us to manage the placement risk of lower grade volumes and  pivot towards potential growth markets.  Fortescue is also investing in iron making technologies that use our ores as input to  produce green metal while producing the green inputs for the process (decarbonised  iron ore, green hydrogen and renewable energy) and constructing the Green Metal  Project to demonstrate that green metal production is feasible for Fortescue’s ore  types.  ===== PAGE 90 ===== RISK DETAIL STRATEGIC RESPONSE The economic viability and cost- competitiveness of green hydrogen  and ammonia present another  major transition risk. Currently,  green hydrogen production is  more expensive than traditional  methods due to high costs of  electrolysers and renewable energy  infrastructure. Market confidence  may be impacted if green energy  projects are not executed or are too  cost intensive. To address the economic viability and cost-competitiveness of green hydrogen,  the GEM Centre has initiated the manufacturing of electrolysers on its automated  assembly line and is currently optimising processes to reduce overall assembly  duration. By leveraging automation and scale, the business mitigates labour  constraints and reduces component costs, ultimately achieving a lower cost of  hydrogen. Producing high pressure proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysers offers  several key technological advantages that enhance cost competitiveness. The  fast response times of PEM electrolysers enable higher utilisation factors when  operating on variable renewable energy, while their high pressure and purity reduce  downstream gas processing requirements, thereby lowering the overall cost of  hydrogen production. This approach not only supports the economic viability of  green hydrogen but also builds market confidence by demonstrating efficient and  cost-effective execution of green energy projects. Reputational damage tied to changing societal expectations We consider our Real Zero  transition not just a regulatory  or ethical mandate but also  a competitive differentiator.  Falling short of decarbonisation  commitments can result in a loss  of competitive edge, damaging our  reputation, eroding stakeholder  trust and brand value. We are investing heavily in the decarbonisation of Fortescue’s iron ore operations in  order to meet our Real Zero commitments.  Our Fortescue global brand is built on a vision of shareholder value in the growing  green transition. Sustainability has been deeply integrated into the way our business  orients to market.  The examples of decarbonisation of our mining operations, the core technologies  coming to market under Fortescue Zero and the large-scale energy projects we have  under development are compelling proof of our commitment and will remain a key  aspect of our strategic communications.  Our portfolio has grown through acquisition and research, and now includes many  different aspects of the global green transition. This increased scale of our global  operations abates some risk as well.  We connect regularly with our stakeholders across the business and work to deliver  narrative examples across our channels, and to evaluate if any challenges are going  to impact our plans.  climate change Report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    86  ===== PAGE 91 ===== climate change  report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    87 Operating and   financial review Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Financial report Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Overview RISK DETAIL STRATEGIC RESPONSE Potential greenwashing allegations  pose a significant risk to our  business, as they can undermine  our reputation and lead to legal and  financial penalties.  If our sustainability efforts are  perceived as misleading or if we  unintentionally fail to comply with  the law, environmental regulations  or ‘green’ product certification  requirements, we risk eroding  stakeholder trust and attracting  scrutiny from third parties  including regulators, shareholders,  environmental and activist groups,  and competitors, which could  result in legal consequences (e.g.  damages and injunctions) and  damage to our reputation and  market credibility. We deliver advice and training to Fortescue personnel on the risks of greenwashing,  and we prepare and circulate guidelines on best practices to help mitigate risk.  Additionally, we review and advise on greenwashing risks in various company  materials and publications, including annual reports. Our market announcements are  handled in accordance with our Continuous Disclosure and Market Communications  Policy. By integrating sustainability into our core business strategies, we align all  aspects of our operations with our sustainability goals, with the goal of ensuring  transparency and credibility.  In 2023, we made improvements to our internal verification process to continue to  ensure Fortescue’s publications accurately represent our activities. Led by our Legal  team, this process involves checks to verify the accuracy of our sustainability claims  and help prevent misleading information. Prioritisation of decarbonisation  strategy to address climate  change may divert focus from  other sustainability-related risks.  This could lead to potential  challenges to uphold our social  and environmental policy  commitments. Balancing our focus  on climate action with our broader  sustainability obligations remains  critical to maintaining stakeholder  trust and ensuring comprehensive  environmental stewardship. Sustainability is integrated into our decision-making, strategic and risk management  processes. Compliance with all relevant legislation and obligations, including those  that govern health, safety and environment, is the absolute minimum standard to  which we operate.  Our sustainability commitments are developed in collaboration with our stakeholders  and aim to create value for our investors, ensure the health and safety of our  employees, protect the environment and empower the communities in which we  operate. Our unique culture and Values form the base of our sustainability approach,  which drives specific policies, ambitions and targets. Fortescue operates under a Code of Conduct and Integrity which reflects our Values  and represents our commitment to uphold the highest ethical business practices.  Our core principles and Values are documented in the Code, which is supported by a  suite of policies and standards that shape our business, including several supporting  our sustainability related matters such as our Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy,  Diversity Policy, Environment Policy, Equal Opportunity, Discrimination and  Workplace Bullying Policy, and our Health and Safety Policy.  ===== PAGE 92 ===== climate change Report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    88 CLIMATE-RELATED  GOVERNANCE MANAGEMENT BOARD SUSTAINABILITY  COMMITTEE Support and advise the  ARMSC on climate-related  strategy, risks and reporting Emissions actuals  and forecasts DECARBONISATION  STEERING  COMMITTEE Guidance and direction  to decarbonisation  program leadership Endorse capital  investment decisions Solution Selections Program progress including  capital estimates FORTESCUE ENERGY  PROJECT INVESTMENT  COMMITTEE Provide input and guidance  on capital investments  related to Energy: Projects Large operational purchases  and fees Large investments  Remuneration and  People Committee¹ Nomination  Committee¹ Finance  Committee¹  Audit, Risk Management  and Sustainability Committee¹  1 Effective 1 July 2024, Fortescue implemented a new committee structure.

The SC is chaired by  the Director of Sustainability and External Affairs or a C-suite  Executive.  Members of the SC include executive officers and senior  leadership representatives from a number of areas,  including: •	 C-Suite executive team (Chief Executive Officers (CEOs),  Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Chief Operating Officer  (COO))  •	 Sustainability and External Affairs  •	 Legal •	 Approvals, Community and Environment  •	 Decarbonisation  •	 Contracts and Procurement  •	 Communications  •	 Investor Relations and Funding •	 Fortescue People. The SC met three times in FY24 and provided updates  and advice to the ARMSC at its quarterly meetings on  a range of climate-related issues, including emissions  actuals and forecasts, Science Based Targets initiative  (SBTi) submissions and emerging mandatory disclosure  requirements. From 1 July 2024, such updates will be  provided to the newly-established Safety and Sustainability  Committee. Decarbonisation Steering  Committee The Decarbonisation Steering Committee (DSC) comprises  the Fortescue Metals and Fortescue Energy CEOs and  the Fortescue CFO and additional executives as required  depending on the topics for discussion. The DSC  endorses capital investment decisions in advance of these  progressing to the Board; makes decisions on solution  selection; reviews program progress, including updated  capital estimates; and provides guidance and direction to  the Decarbonisation Program leadership.  The DSC met eight times in FY24 and provided updates and  advice to the ARMSC at its quarterly meetings on a range  of issues, including implementation of our decarbonisation  strategy and allocation of capital for decarbonisation  projects. From 1 July 2024, such updates will be provided to  the newly-established Audit, Finance and Risk Management  Committee (AFRMC). Project Investment Committee  and Gateway Review Group Fortescue has strong dynamic capabilities, taking advantage  of opportunities as they arise to establish competitive  advantage and initiate change. Our greatest opportunity  potential lies within the transition into a vertically integrated  green energy and resources company. To support this  transition, we have clear guidelines established to support  the process of evaluating new investments and development  opportunities. The Fortescue Energy Project Investment Framework (PIF)  guides the evaluation and development of capital investment  opportunities from project inception to construction and  operations. The PIF drives consideration and assessment of  a wide range of criteria including commercial viability and  emission reduction potential, as well as sustainability and  human rights issues. As a project matures from inception  to execution, it is reviewed by the Project Investment  Committee prior to Board approval.  There is an existing development framework for Metals  projects, and with the recent amalgamation of our Projects  teams we will be looking to amend the PIF process to include  all Major Projects.  Similarly, at Fortescue Zero, the New Product Creation  System provides high-level guidance on the process to  facilitate delivery through a structured set of milestones.  This ensures that a wide range of sustainability  considerations are incorporated throughout the  development of new products. All projects are subject  to prior review and recommendation by the Gateway  Review Group. Membership of this group consists of lead  representatives from each part of the business involved in  the opportunity being discussed.  ===== PAGE 94 ===== climate change Report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    90 Managing risk Fortescue takes a risk-based approach to understand its exposure and  vulnerability to climate change.  Our risk culture emanates from our Values, builds on our  Code of Conduct and Integrity and is operationalised  through Fortescue’s Risk Management Framework (FRMF).  The FRMF provides a consistent approach to identifying,  assessing and treating risks, monitoring associated  controls and reviewing the continued effectiveness of risk  management across the business. It consists of a Risk  Management Policy, Risk Management Standard and a  Risk Management Procedure, and is further supported by  standards on planning for business continuity and disaster  response. The consistent application of Fortescue’s Risk Management  Standard by all management teams directly supports the  Board’s oversight of the material risks that could impact  Fortescue’s ability to create or preserve value for its  stakeholders over the short, medium and long term. In line  with our Values and a strong belief in the long-term success  of developing internal capability, we have a designated  Climate Risk subject matter expert working with our Risk  and Assurance team to reinforce consideration of climate  risk within our risk culture and risk management processes.  For further information on the FRMF and our material risk  exposures, please refer to our FY24 Corporate Governance  Statement, available on our website at fortescue.com.   Integrating climate change into  enterprise risk management Fortescue is building on our long-term understanding of  climate-related risks and opportunities as we turn our focus on  integrating climate change into our global risk management  system (CGR) aligned to our FRMF.  We have commenced an internal review process to refine and  consolidate processes and practices, leveraging our FRMF  to ensure a consistent and integrated approach to identify,  assess, prioritise and monitor climate-related risks across the  business. The review feeds into our internal Climate Readiness  Program, set up with a focus on coordinating and building  internal capabilities to enable consistent integration of climate  risk within a number of critical business functions. Given its significance within Fortescue’s value chain, we  started the process using a case study approach to analyse  key operational risks associated with Herb Elliott Port  and associated key port infrastructure. In this process, we  specifically focused on possibilities to integrate climate risk  assessment methodology into existing risk management  practice, with the intention to apply learnings across our  whole suite of material climate-related risks and opportunities  identified through the Sustainability Materiality assessment  (see climate-related risks in Our Strategy).  Provide scope,  context, criteria Treat risk Monitor and  review Identify and  assess risk  ===== PAGE 95 ===== climate change  report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    91 Operating and   financial review Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Financial report Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Overview Leveraging our existing risk management framework Identify and  assess risk The risk identification process  includes the systematic  identification of potential  threats and uncertainties  that could affect our ability to  achieve objectives.  Relevant stakeholders  are involved to assess the  potential likelihood and  consequence of the risk and  determine whether the risk is  material to the business.  Integration of climate change will involve identifying and monitoring climate- related risks at multiple levels within the corporate risk management system.  Climate-related risks are identified at the strategic level and entered as a ‘parent  risk’ into Fortescue’s Sustainability risk register. This ensures strategic oversight and  collaboration across various business areas.  Parent risks will then be linked to their corresponding ‘operational’ risks managed  by the respective teams, creating multiple ‘layers’ of how climate-related risks and  opportunities are monitored across the business. With a specific focus on Herb Elliott Port and the Judith Street Harbour towage  infrastructure in Port Hedland as a case study, we considered the strategic risk  of potential damage to assets or operational disruptions, specifically looking at  eight existing risk events in the port operations risk register with climate-related  hazard exposure. Risks included Port Hedland channel blockage, vessel sinking  or grounding at Fortescue berth, potential environmental breaches, fixed plant  structural failure, and failure of shiploader, stockyard balance machine and train  unloader. Provide scope,  context, criteria  The risk management process  begins with defining business  objectives, and managers  regularly review risks in  relation to these objectives. Internal and external factors  influence risk exposure,  including economic or  geopolitical developments,  climate change, communities’  and investors’ expectations, or  legislative requirements. Integration of climate change will involve operationalising the consideration of  multiple time horizons into relevant business risks and to introduce standardised  guidance on climate-related scenario analysis for strategic and operational level  application.  The Risk Management Standard sets a materiality threshold for the risks of greatest  significance to Fortescue and outlines the Company’s expectations with respect to  understanding and managing those risks. Material operational risks, such as those  related to port and rail infrastructure, are identified and articulated in the Group’s risk  management system.  Managing climate-related risk requires a more forward-looking approach than is  typically used for other risks because climate change is considered an ‘emerging’  risk, as physical climate hazards may worsen over time and the transition to a net  zero economy becomes increasingly urgent.

Options for managing each  risk include accepting the risk,  avoiding the risk, transferring  the risk or mitigating the risk. Integration of climate change will involve introducing a forward-looking approach  to risk and vulnerability management and developing standardised processes and  procedures to systematically capture impacts of climate-related events.  Identified operational risks were re-assessed to consider medium and long-term  horizons to take account of the possible increase in the frequency and intensity of  extreme events for high emission trajectories. Risk treatment plans are also reviewed  to identify vulnerabilities to projected changes.  While approaching unprecedented conditions, to understand the implications of  future change requires a robust understanding of current climate-related impacts to  evaluate risks, allocate resources, and develop strategies for long-term resilience. Monitor and  review Risks are reviewed at  least annually, including  re-evaluation of the risk  environment, assessment of  critical control effectiveness,  and a review of the status of  risk treatment actions.  The directors, through the  ARMSC1, regularly review the   Group’s risk profile and assess  progress in managing high  and extreme risks. Integrating climate change into operations will involve setting up a physical climate  risk dashboard, representing worst-case scenario exposure across multiple time  horizons. A forward-looking reassessment of existing operational risks revealed that while  some risks are already well-controlled, others could escalate due to climate change  if not proactively managed. The introduction of a designated climate-risk dashboard  will support internal monitoring and review processes, illustrating expectations of  how climate-related risks and potential impacts may evolve over time.  1 From 1 July 2024, such reviews will be undertaken through the newly- established Safety and Sustainability Committee.  ===== PAGE 97 ===== climate change  report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    93 Operating and   financial review Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Financial report Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Overview Climate resilience  Fortescue commenced scenario-driven analysis in 2019 in line with TCFD- aligned climate disclosure requirements. Since then, scenarios have been  continuously revised to reflect global developments and to accommodate our  rapidly evolving business needs. In 2023, we progressed our approach to scenario analysis,  building on the narratives proposed in the IPCC Sixth  Assessment Report. To assess physical climate risks,  we used SSP1-1.9 (a low emission scenario), SSP2-4.5  (a moderate emission scenario), and SSP5-8.5 (a high  emission scenario) to explore our exposure to physical risk  for Pilbara assets, Phoenix (Arizona, US), and the Coastal  China region for 2030 and 2050. The analysis included  the anticipation of a worst-case scenario to understand  extremes to inform infrastructure design standards. While  high-end emission scenarios are considered increasingly  unlikely, we acknowledge that this cannot be ruled out due  to uncertainties associated with potential feedback in the  climate system, including tipping points. For transition risks, we selected three low-emission  scenarios (SSP1-1.9, SSP2-2.6, SSP5-2.6) considering  differences in economic and population growth, resource  demand and global trade. In this assessment, we focused  on the influence of key value chain jurisdictions, namely the  European Union, the US and China. The three low-emission  scenarios represent divergent economic narratives to  a common global decarbonisation path, one of which is  consistent with the most ambitious global temperature  goal set out in the Australian Climate Change Act 2022.  Considering multiple scenarios is important in transition  planning, as these require us to evaluate a variety of  socio-economic challenges associated with mitigation and  adaptation actions. Moving beyond an orderly transition  scenario assumes that companies and governments must  decarbonise quickly and therefore takes into account the  increased risk of sudden market and policy changes. As we move towards Real Zero, deciding which growth  options to pursue will be increasingly complex due to  varying levels of uncertainty and risk. We continue to  build our knowledge on climate change scenarios and  future global outlooks by engaging with multiple external  information providers. These viewpoints help us understand  of the pace of the global transition towards renewable  energy use and potential emission reduction trajectories  over time. Both fast and slow energy transitions contemplate  technology development, market demands, and cost factors  for products and energy.  The impacts of these scenarios will be incorporated into the  strategic planning and decision-making processes across  all of Fortescue’s growth options in technology, energy  and metals. Initial analyses will be conducted in FY25, with  plans for broader integration as appropriate throughout the  organisation.  ===== PAGE 98 ===== climate change Report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    94 METRICS Greenhouse gas  emissions Our objective for Scope 1 and 2 emissions is to eliminate  the use of fossil fuels from our Australian iron ore terrestrial  operations by 2030. To address Scope 3 emissions,  Fortescue has set a target of net zero Scope 3 emissions by  2040. Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from sources owned  or controlled by an entity. Scope 2 refers to emissions  associated with the production of electricity, heat, or steam  purchased by an entity. Scope 3 refers to all other indirect  emissions associated with activities or facilities not owned  or controlled by the entity. In Australia, Fortescue has a mandatory obligation to report  Scope 1 and 2 emissions from its Australian operations  above a certain threshold under the National Greenhouse  and Energy Reporting (NGER) scheme. Established by the  NGER Act 2007, the NGER scheme is a national framework  for reporting company information about greenhouse gas  emissions, energy production, energy consumption and  other information specified under NGER legislation.  Fortescue’s FY24 emissions are calculated in accordance  with the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol’s Corporate  Standard, the GHG Protocol’s Scope 2 Guidance, Corporate  Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard, and Technical Guidance for  Calculating Scope 3 Emissions and in accordance with the  NGER Measurement Determination 2008 for our emissions  mandated under NGER legislation. At Fortescue, we place high importance on data quality  for all sustainability issues and continuously improve  our systems and processes to increase quality, integrity,  relevance and completeness of emissions data. We  continuously seek to improve our data sourcing, focusing on  the most material emissions categories.  Our approach to boundary setting and our emissions  calculation is available in our FY24 Emissions Calculation  Methodology document at fortescue.com.  ===== PAGE 99 ===== climate change  report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    95 Operating and   financial review Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Financial report Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Overview Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions   FY24 emissions (mtCO2-e) FY23 emissions (mtCO2-e) FY22 emissions (mtCO2-e) Total Group Scope 1 2.36 2.20 2.21 Our most significant Scope 1 emissions include those from our Australian iron ore operations and Fortescue marine vessels,  which consist of eight very large ore carriers and nine tugboats that operate under Fortescue’s operational control in Port  Hedland. The increase in emissions is driven by increased consumption of gas to meet the power demand of our Iron Bridge facility.   For information on our strategy to reduce these emissions please refer to the Decarbonising our Iron Ore Operations section.   As mentioned in our Climate Transition Plan, the introduction of Iron Bridge ores in our product offering will enable up to two   to three per cent reduction in our Scope 3 emissions intensity by FY30. Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions Fortescue adopts dual reporting for its Scope 2 emissions: market-based method and location-based method.    FY24 emissions (mtCO2-e) FY23 emissions (mtCO2-e) FY22 emissions (mtCO2-e) Total Group Scope 2 - location based 0.37 0.35 0.33 Total Group Scope 2 - market based  (reported for whole Group in FY24,  and for Australia only in FY23 and  FY22) 0.50 0.54 0.43 Increases in Scope 2 location-based emissions in FY24 is largely attributed to the increased electricity consumption at the   Iron Bridge concentrate handling facility as a result of increases in production. Decreases of our Scope 2 market-based emissions in Australia in FY24 is driven by the decrease in the national residual mix  factor. Progress against our Scope 1 and 2 absolute target Emissions covered by our Real Zero target represent 87 per cent of our FY22 Group Scope 1 and 2 emissions (our base year).  Annual progress against this target is present in the table below: FY24 emissions (mtCO2-e) FY23 emissions (mtCO2-e) FY22 emissions (mtCO2-e) Metals Australian Terrestrial  Scope 1 emissions 2.02 1.91 1.88 Metals Australian Terrestrial  Scope 2 emissions  (location-based) 0.36 0.35 0.33 Metals Australian Terrestrial  Scope 1 and 2 emissions  (location-based) 2.38 2.26 2.21 Energy efficiency initiatives helped limit the increase in these emissions in FY24 to 5.4 per cent. This reflects a reduction   of approximately 10 per cent against Fortescue’s budgeted emissions for the year. Scope 1 and 2 physical intensity Emissions intensity refers to the amount of greenhouse gases emitted per unit of output. This provides insight into the   energy and emission efficiencies of each tonnes of iron ore produced and shipped.   Unit FY24  FY23  Iron ore shipped wmt 191.6 192.0 Group Scope 1 and 2 emissions (location- based) mtCO2-e 2.72 2.55 Group Scope 1 and 2 location-based  emissions intensity tCO2-e/wmt of  ore shipped 0.014 0.013 The 6.9 per cent increase in Scope 1 and 2 emissions combined with a 0.2 per cent decrease in ore produced, resulted in a   7.2 per cent increase in emissions intensity in FY24. This is driven by increased consumption from facilities that are still powered  by fossil fuels. For information on our strategy to reduce these emissions please refer to the Decarbonising our Iron Ore  Operations section.   ===== PAGE 100 ===== climate change Report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    96 Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions Scope 3 emissions are those that fall within our value chain but are outside our operational control, including those  generated during the shipping of our products in non-Fortescue vessels and iron and steel production.

At 269.31mtCO2-e, our Scope 3 emissions in FY24 were 0.6 per cent higher than in FY23, primarily driven by increases in  steelmaking and shipping emissions.  Steelmaking accounted for 97 per cent of our Scope 3 emissions in FY24. Our overall volume of iron ore shipped remained  stable at 191.6Mt. Changes to product mix and customer base led to a 0.3 per cent increase in processing of sold products  (Scope 3 category 10).  The 18.7 per cent increase in combined Scope 3 categories 4 and 9 emissions was driven by the update of emissions  factors in the Global Logistics Emissions Council Framework v3.0 and reflects an accounting-driven variance. Emissions for  FY23 and earlier have not been re-assessed or restated this year, although this is planned to ensure that we are accurately  monitoring progress against a like-for-like baseline.

All other eligible employees  participate in the short-term Staff Incentive Plan (SIP). Targets related to emission reductions have existed in the  LTIP since FY21. Following a review at the end of FY23,  changes were made by the Remuneration and People  Committee for FY24 to incorporate into all short-term  incentive plans to continue to drive the link between variable  remuneration and our Decarbonisation Program for all  employees across our business. In FY24, Decarbonisation related KPIs sit in both the Metals  and Energy scorecards and make up 10 to 20 per cent of the  overall short-term incentive opportunity. Targets include  the delivery of FY24 milestones against the integrated  decarbonisation schedule and budget, and a reduction in  emissions. The scorecard for the Energy business also has  an additional 30 per cent related to the development and  commercialisation of projects and products that support  decarbonisation more broadly. Fortescue’s on-foot LTIP  includes a number of strategic measures that support  climate related action, including the development of  Fortescue’s green fleet and stationary power infrastructure,  green metal, and growth of the Energy business. These  targets typically account for approximately one-third of the  total strategic measures component of the LTIP. Details of the remuneration policies for all employees and  the remuneration paid to directors (executive and non- executive) and executives are set out in the Remuneration  Report.  Carbon Credits In 2023, Fortescue ceased purchasing voluntary carbon  offsets for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, instead focusing our  efforts on the elimination of emissions. Carbon offsets  against Scope 1 and 2 emissions are purchased and  relinquished only to the extent required by legislation. Our  participation in compliance markets is therefore limited to  purchases required only to the extent of law, tapering in line  with facility-level decarbonisation plans. Accordingly, we  note that: 1.	 Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) are used to meet  regulatory requirements under the National Greenhouse  and Energy Reporting (Safeguard Mechanism) Rule 2015  (SGM) requirements.  2.	In FY24 Fortescue is expected to be in excess of SGM  baselines by approximately 120,000tCO2-e, requiring  an equivalent number of ACCUs to be acquired and  surrendered to the Australian Government.  3.	Fortescue is investigating using methods available under  the SGM, including multi-year monitoring periods, to  reduce the number of ACCUs required at facilities with  advanced decarbonisation plans. 4.	The ACCUs that Fortescue is required to acquit FY24  SGM exceedances are produced by third parties under  the Australian Government’s approved methodologies,  and acquired through a third party broker. The underlying  carbon credits are from nature-based carbon removal  projects.  ===== PAGE 103 ===== climate change  report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    99 Operating and   financial review Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Financial report Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Overview Capital  expenditure,  financing and  investment Capital investment allocation  In September 2022, Fortescue’s Board approved capital  expenditure of US$6.2 billion for decarbonisation of our  iron ore operations by 2030. Aligned with our approach to  decarbonisation, we have allocated the investment towards  green energy and green mining fleet.  In FY24, the committed decarbonisation capital was   US$224 million. Fortescue’s forecast capital expenditure  guidance for decarbonisation in FY25 is US$700 - US$900  million. The estimated capital required to complete our  decarbonisation program is updated as our studies and  engineering design work progresses, as new information  is received from the market and as our projects progress.  Updates are reported up to our Decarbonisation Steering  Committee and our Board, and the decarbonisation capital  requirements are considered in the context of the Group’s  capital allocation framework and funding strategy.  Each separable project which forms part of the overall  decarbonisation program will be taken to the Board for  Final Investment Decision to approve capital for that  project. As we determine the optimal technical solutions to  eliminate the last approximately 10 per cent of emissions,  the incremental capital and operating costs over and above  our ‘business as usual’ expectations will be outlined to our  Decarbonisation Steering Committee before a decision is  made on the preferred solution. As we mature our understanding of the financial impact  of climate-related risks and opportunities, we are also  developing systems and processes to track all climate- related spending. When combining our decarbonisation  expenditure with our broader ambition towards a greener  energy future, we have invested more than 11 per cent  of our total FY24 spend (including capital and operating  expenditure on our Decarbonisation, Energy and Green  Metal projects).  Sustainability Financing  Framework Fortescue remains committed to sustainability in all  aspects of our business. Part of our capital structure is our  Sustainability Financing Framework, which enables the  issuance of Green Bonds or Loans.  The Framework outlines eligible green projects including  renewable energy, green hydrogen and ammonia,  sustainable water management and socio-economic  advancement and empowerment initiatives. It also outlines  a range of impact indicators that will be used for impact  reporting for the use of proceeds.  This Framework was used in our inaugural Green Bond  in April 2022 for US$800 million. Allocation reporting is  provided in the Operating and Financial Review section of  this report.  ===== PAGE 104 ===== climate change Report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    100 Exposure  to climate- related risks Physical risk exposure As part of our commitment to enhance the resilience of  our assets and to mitigate climate-related risks, we have  partnered with our insurance partners  to better understand  our climate-related hazard exposure of our critical assets  in Australia. Asset vulnerability to extreme climate events  such as flood, wind and fire was considered combined with  site-specific factors such as construction design, location  of the asset and risk mitigation actions. By leveraging our  insurance partner’s expertise in risk management and  insurance, we aim to develop targeted strategies to protect  our infrastructure and ensure operational continuity. At the  time of this report, 11 designated sites have been assessed,  including our operating mines in the Pilbara, together with  Perth Head Office, Gladstone GEM Centre, Herb Elliott  Port and associated Port Hedland facilities. Combined, this  represents a total area of 38,920 ha, of which 71 per cent  (27,514 ha) was assessed as being exposed to one or more  peril. Exposure to risk of stranded  assets by 2030  There is ongoing work to consider the financial implications  arising from climate-related risks related to changes in the  useful life of assets, residual values and changes in the fair  valuation of assets as a result of our energy transition. We  can reasonably expect that finalising this work will result in  an impact on: •	 financial estimates and matters of judgement  •	 provisions for potential liabilities •	 expenses.  ===== PAGE 105 ===== climate change  report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    101 Operating and   financial review Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Financial report Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Overview NAVIGATIONAL INDEX This navigational index references the location of TCFD-aligned disclosures.

FY24 Fortescue performance FY24 was another year of strong operational and financial  performance for Fortescue, while maintaining our  unwavering focus on safety. Significant milestones were  achieved across both Metals and Energy, aligned with  delivering on our vision and strategy. Our group wide safety performance continued to improve,  with Metals achieving its lowest ever Total Recordable Injury  Frequency Rate (TRIFR), far exceeding the stretch target set  by the business. Fortescue’s strong operating performance and capital and  cost discipline contributed to outstanding financial results  in FY24. Our net profit after tax of US$5.7 billion represented  the third highest earnings in Fortescue’s history. At the same  time, our balance sheet remains strong, meaning we are well  positioned to continue to invest in growth opportunities. Iron ore shipments achieved the second highest volume  in our Company’s history which was an outstanding effort  given the challenges the team had to overcome, including an  ore car derailment and significant weather disruptions. We  responded to the challenges and implemented a recovery  plan which led to record shipments in the June quarter. This  was a real demonstration of our Values in action and meant  that Fortescue was still able to exceed its stretch target for  hematite shipments, resulting in a partial achievement of our  production targets. Fortescue’s continued drive for efficiency  and productivity contributed to strong cost management  and resulted in partial achievement of Fortescue’s stretch  target for hematite C1 cost. Our new Iron Bridge mine transitioned to operational  production and achieved its first shipment of high grade  magnetite concentrate in early FY24. Commissioning  activities progressed with expenditure targets achieved and  continued focus on a safe and efficient ramp up. However C1  Cost and production targets were not achieved. Good progress was made towards our decarbonisation  targets with the commissioning of three electric excavators  across our sites, the development of battery electric  and hydrogen fuel cell haul truck prototypes, and the  construction of a 100MW solar farm. Efforts to increase  energy efficiency across our sites resulted in a 10 per cent  reduction from our forecast CO2 emissions in FY24. This saw  us exceed our FY24 stretch targets for decarbonisation.  Our Energy business took the first green energy projects  to Final Investment Decision and turned soil on our Arizona  Hydrogen project in the United States. Work commenced  on our Gladstone PEM50 project in Queensland – a green  hydrogen project utilising Fortescue’s own electrolyser  technology. The Fortescue Board has also agreed to fast- track two more projects, with Holmaneset in Norway and  Pecém in Brazil progressing to feasibility phase. Through Fortescue Zero, we are creating the solutions  required to drive a zero emissions future by developing a  range of technologies that can be used across a variety of  applications and industries. Sales contracts were executed  with new and existing customers for battery packs, battery  management systems and battery intelligence software.  Fortescue Zero also saw the first sales contracts for  electrolysers signed, shortly after we opened our Gladstone  Electrolyser Manufacturing Centre.  Fortescue is committed to diversity and inclusion in the  workplace, with steady growth achieved in both female and  First Nations Australians participation. Diversity targets  were partially achieved across both Metals and Energy.  Whilst overall voluntary employee turnover remains low  at approximately eight per cent, we had a higher level of  executive turnover and employee engagement targets were  not achieved in FY24. Diversity, inclusion and engagement  remain a key priority for the Board in FY25.  ===== PAGE 112 ===== Directors’ report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    108 Key Management Personnel  (KMP) Changes In FY24 our management team has come together as ‘One  Fortescue’. This has seen further evolution of the operating  model and some changes to senior leadership to ensure  operations are streamlined and our values driven culture is  fostered across the business. In August 2023, we announced the appointment of Dino  Otranto to the role of Chief Executive Officer (CEO),  Fortescue Metals. Mr Otranto joined Fortescue in 2021 as  Chief Operating Officer, Iron Ore and quickly established  himself as an integral member of the Fortescue family.  Dino’s appointment reflects our commitment to developing  and promoting internal talent. His role sits alongside Mark  Hutchinson as CEO, Fortescue Energy, with both reporting  directly to the Board.  In October 2023, Shelley Robertson joined Fortescue in the  role of Chief Corporate Officer (CCO). She has a significant  portfolio which brings together a number of core business  functions that sit across both the Metals and Energy  businesses. In July 2024 we announced that Ms Robertson  had been appointed to the role of Chief Operating Officer.   As the One Fortescue approach continues to evolve, we  have reestablished a Group Chief Financial Officer (CFO)  role which is responsible for both the Metals and Energy  businesses. Apple Paget was initially appointed to this  role on an acting basis, and in July 2024 we were pleased  to announce her appointment to this role on a permanent  basis.  During the year we appointed two new independent non  executive directors to the Board. Dr Larry Marshall, former  CEO of CSIRO, is a technology innovator, business leader,  published author and a Male Champion of Change with  a wealth of experience in creating new value and impact  through innovation. Usha Rao-Monari is an experienced  international executive and director with finance,  infrastructure investment and environmental expertise,  especially in the area of water.  In August 2024 we announced the appointment of Noel  Pearson to the Fortescue Board as a non executive director.  Mr Pearson is a prominent Australian indigenous leader,  social advocate and lawyer. FY24 Remuneration framework  and outcomes Fortescue’s remuneration framework is designed to be  competitive in attracting and retaining the best talent, while  also aligning with shareholder expectations by setting  challenging stretch targets and rewarding for performance.  When assessing outcomes, the Board maintains a holistic  view of performance. Consideration is given to what the  Board determines to be a fair outcome in the circumstances,  taking account of what was delivered by executives, how it  was delivered in alignment with Fortescue’s Values, and the  experience and expectations of shareholders. A summary of performance and the link to remuneration  outcomes is set out below.  FY24 Fixed remuneration changes Fortescue positions fixed remuneration for executives with  reference to the median of S&P/ASX50 Index and ASX-listed  resources peer groups. On taking up the role of Chief Executive Officer, Fortescue  Metals, Mr Otranto’s total fixed remuneration (TFR) was  set at A$1,400,000. This was subsequently reviewed and  increased to A$1,750,000 with effect from January 2024  based on market benchmarking and the Board’s assessment  of his performance in the role.  Ms Robertson’s total fixed remuneration on appointment was  set at A$725,000 with reference to external benchmarks.   Ms Paget has been provided with a higher duties allowance  with her total fixed remuneration set at A$840,000 to  recognise the additional responsibilities associated with  taking on the Group Chief Financial Officer role in an acting  capacity.  In line with other executives, a four per cent increase was  applied to CEO, Fortescue Energy Mr Hutchinson’s TFR  effective 1 July 2023 bringing his TFR to A$2,080,000. Further detail regarding these changes is outlined in   section 5.  ===== PAGE 113 ===== Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    109 Operating and   financial review Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability climate change  report Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Overview Financial report FY24 Executive and Senior Staff Incentive  Plan (ESSIP) outcomes The Board set stretch targets for the FY24 ESSIP to drive  outperformance in business operations and financial  performance, aimed at maximising shareholder value. FY24 ESSIP performance conditions included operational  production, cost and decarbonisation targets, delivery of  projects and products, people and culture measures, and  individual Key Performance Indicators. Overall, the FY24  ESSIP outcomes for the CEOs and other KMP ranged from  50 per cent to 79 per cent of target. Section 5 of the Report provides further detail regarding the  targets and their achievement. FY22 Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)  outcomes  Vesting of the FY22 LTIP is assessed over a three year  performance period from 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2024. FY22  was the first year in which we assessed outcomes based on  separate scorecards for our Metals and Energy businesses.  The Metals scorecard consisted of Return on Equity (ROE),  relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR), and Strategic  Measures aligned with the Company’s long-term objectives.  Performance conditions were tested and vested at 81.3 per  cent based on TSR and ROE performance and progress  against strategic measures that are critical to our future  success.  The Energy scorecard consisted of Total Shareholder Return  (TSR), an independent valuation metric, and Strategic  Measures aligned with the Company’s long-term objectives.  The performance conditions were tested and vested at 30  per cent.  FY24 LTIP scorecard To further support the evolution of the One Fortescue  operating model, and to simplify and align all executives  to a single long term vision, the LTIP has transitioned from  separate scorecards for our Metals and Energy businesses  to one single Fortescue scorecard for FY24 onwards. Further  information relating to the FY24 LTIP is set out in section 6. Response to first strike and  FY25 remuneration changes  Following the first strike that Fortescue received against the  FY23 Remuneration Report at its Annual General Meeting  (AGM), the Board has listened to this feedback and has been  proactively engaging with proxy advisors and investors to  address the key areas of concern.  A detailed response to the feedback is outlined in section  3 of this report, but in summary, the following changes to  our remuneration framework will be, or have already been,  implemented: •	 whilst the Board retains its ability to apply discretion  to incentive outcomes, it will not make discretionary  payments that do not clearly align with shareholder  interests, noting that no special recognition awards were  made in FY24 •	 introduction of a mandatory ESSIP deferral for KMP of  50 per cent across two years from the FY25 ESSIP grant  onwards •	 increased weighting to relative TSR and reduced  weighting to Strategic Measures for the LTIP •	 improved disclosure of Strategic Measures for all on-foot  LTIP grants (FY22, FY23 and FY24) and  •	 shareholder approval for participation of the CEOs in the  Performance Rights Plan at the 2024 AGM. The evolution of our One Fortescue approach will remain  a priority for all leaders across Fortescue in FY25. A  key element of this will be ensuring we create the right  environment so that all our people can thrive and achieve  true collaboration, innovation and success. To support  this, we will have one consolidated ESSIP scorecard across  Metals and Energy in FY25. The Board is committed to actively engaging with  shareholders to understand concerns and effectively  communicating Fortescue’s remuneration and governance  framework. I invite you to read our Report and trust you will find  that it outlines the links between our strategy, culture,  performance and remuneration outcomes.  On behalf of the directors, we look forward to welcoming you  and receiving your feedback at our 2024 AGM.

RESPONSE TO FIRST STRIKE Following the first strike against the remuneration report in 2023, the table below sets out below a summary of the key  concerns raised and Fortescue’s response to them. Area of feedback Response The use of discretionary  payments The Board has heard this feedback and whilst it retains the ability to apply discretion to  incentive outcomes, it will not make discretionary payments that do not clearly align with  shareholder interests. The use of Board   discretion in Short Term  Incentive (STI)   outcomes For the FY23 ESSIP, the previous cliff vesting approach was replaced with a sliding scale  that was used to assess outcomes between threshold and stretch levels of performance.  This change improves transparency and clarity of outcomes and reduces the need for Board  discretion when compared to a cliff vesting approach. Board discretion was not applied to any  of the FY23 STI outcomes. Some downward discretion to KMP STI outcomes was applied in  FY24. “Doubling up” of   CEO and CFO  remuneration The two CEO model is deemed the appropriate structure to deliver the Company’s vision  and strategy given the scale of the opportunity and the challenges to manage. The Board is  comfortable that remuneration is appropriately benchmarked. As the One Fortescue model continues to mature, we have moved to a single Group CFO. Disclosure of   CEO Metals   remuneration Due to the timing of the appointment to CEO being the same day as the publishing of the  Annual Report, inclusion of Dino Otranto’s remuneration in the report was not possible. Full  disclosure of Dino Otranto’s remuneration is contained in this report. Director fees Mark Barnaba’s remuneration will be updated in FY25 to reflect the removal of fees associated  with Lead Independent Director responsibilities. Elizabeth Gaines’ remuneration has been updated to reflect a reduction in time commitment  as an Executive Director and Global Ambassador Fortescue. Elizabeth Gaines’s annual  remuneration from 1 May 2024 is A$500,000 (with no incentive opportunity or travel  allowance). Board independence   given tenure of   some directors Two new independent NEDs were appointed to the Board in FY24 – Dr Larry Marshall (August  2023) and Usha Rao-Monari (January 2024). An additional independent NED, Noel Pearson,  was appointed at the start of FY25 (August 2024). Dr Larry Marshall will be appointed as Lead Independent Director, effective from the  Company’s AGM. Mark Barnaba will continue as Non-Executive Director and Deputy Chair. Board governance Fortescue acknowledges that strong corporate governance is critical to the long-term,  sustainable success of the Company and is the collective responsibility of the Board of  Directors and all levels of management. Fortescue has a talented, diverse and international Board committed to enhancing and  protecting the interests of shareholders and other key stakeholders. Board committees have recently been reviewed and re-structured to provide appropriate  focus on Risk, Safety, Sustainability and our Climate Transition Plan, as well as to ensure that  all committees are made up of independent NEDs.  With effect from 1 July 2024, the Board committees are as follows: Audit, Finance and Risk Management People, Remuneration and Nomination Safety and Sustainability Performance rights grant  approval for CEOs was not  included in the AGM Whilst not technically required as the CEOs are not directors of the company, the practice of  seeking approval for CEO performance rights grants will be re-introduced for the FY25 grant  at the 2024 AGM.  ===== PAGE 119 ===== Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    115 Operating and   financial review Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability climate change  report Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Overview Financial report Area of feedback Response Use and   disclosure   of LTI strategic   objectives Strategic objectives in the LTI drive a focus on the key projects and initiatives that deliver   long-term value creation and have been specifically designed to ensure they do not overlap  with the more operational-focused individual KPIs in the STI scorecard. Responding to feedback for improved disclosure, enhanced disclosure of the Strategic  Measures for all ‘on-foot’ LTIP grants (FY22, FY23, and FY24) has been included in the  Remuneration Report. Also, in response to feedback, strategic objectives will reduce to 30 per cent, and relative TSR  will increase to 70 per cent to increase the link between executive reward and shareholder  experience. ROE will be removed from the FY25 LTIP scorecard. Ability to achieve stretch  outcomes against  individual measures in  the LTI A review of the company’s remuneration framework is underway for FY25. This review will  look at the remuneration mix (fixed vs variable), the measures and targets (threshold, target,  stretch), and associated vesting outcomes. The vesting schedule for the FY25 LTIP will be simplified and the ability to achieve stretch  against measures within the LTI will be removed (i.e. preventing one KPI outcome offsetting  poor individual performance of another). The 150 per cent Maximum Value Cap which exists to prevent unintended windfall gains from  rapid share price appreciation will remain a feature of the LTIP going forward. FY23 STI outcomes  appeared to be  misaligned to financial  performance Fortescue met or exceeded financial and operational targets in FY23. Record iron ore  shipments and strong underlying EBITDA and NPAT performance were reflected in Total  Shareholder Returns of 41 per cent over the year including total dividends of A$1.75 per share. No discretion was used in assessing the outcomes of the FY23 STI. Use of strategic objectives  in STI raises concern of  duplication The STI scorecard includes Operations (weighted 60 per cent), People & Culture (weighted 20  per cent) and individual, role specific KPIs (weighted 20 per cent). This structure ensures executives are rewarded not just for what is achieved, but also how it is  achieved in line with our Values of a diverse, inclusive and engaging workplace. There is no duplication between the individual KPIs in the STI and the strategic measures in  the LTI. STI rights grant at  the beginning of the  performance period We acknowledge the approach may be unique compared to our peers. However, the Board  feel this approach provides better alignment between Executive remuneration outcomes and  shareholder interests as executives share in any upside or downside over the performance  period. Lack of STI deferral Fortescue’s STI has a mandatory minimum amount of 50 per cent that must be taken in share  rights, with the option to elect up to 100 per cent in shares. A mandatory STI deferral of 50 per cent over two years (25 per cent in year one and 25 per  cent in year two) will be implemented for KMP from the FY25 ESSIP onwards.  ===== PAGE 120 ===== Directors’ report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    116 4.	 BUSINESS PERFORMANCE  Underpinned by our unique culture and Values and a strong  focus on operating excellence and cost management,  Fortescue delivered another year of strong performance  across our stretch safety, production and financial targets. Safety is a core priority and we achieved a TRIFR of  1.3 across Metals in FY24, representing a 28 per cent  improvement on the prior year. While this is an outstanding  and industry leading result that exceeded our stretch target  of 1.8, we remain unwavering in our aim to be a global leader  and focused on leading safety indicators as well as TRIFR. Our iron ore shipments totalled 191.6Mt in FY24, which  is the second highest in the Company’s history. This was  an incredible effort given the challenges the team had to  overcome, including an ore car derailment on our main line  and some significant weather disruptions. The team moved  quickly to implement a recovery plan, and we achieved  record shipments in the June quarter. We also set new  records in railed tonnes, demonstrating the efficiencies  gained through our recovery plan. This record result meant  that Fortescue was still able to exceed its stretch target for  hematite shipments, resulting in a partial achievement of our  production targets. Our Iron Bridge mine transitioned to operational production  and achieved its first shipment of high grade magnetite  concentrate in early FY24. While the performance of the raw  water pipeline impacted production and shipments during  the year, an innovative water management strategy has been  employed to increase plant uptime. This capital efficient  option may mitigate the need to replace the high-pressure  section of the raw water pipeline. Commissioning activities  continue to progress, with our focus on a safe and efficient  ramp up. We remain focused on maintaining an industry leading cost  position and our Hematite C1 cost in FY24 of US$18.24/wmt  was in line with our market guidance. Our C1 cost continues  to be impacted by inflationary pressures, including diesel  prices and labour rates, as well as mine plan led cost  escalation. Our strong cost management resulted in partial  achievement of Fortescue’s stretch target for Hematite C1  cost and Magnetite expenditure. Fortescue’s financial performance was underpinned by  its strong operating performance and customer demand,  together with capital and cost discipline. Underlying EBITDA  of US$10.7 billion was seven per cent higher than FY23  and the net profit after tax of US$5.7 billion was the second  highest in the Company’s history. This contributed to an  underlying return on equity (excluding Fortescue Energy  costs) of 31 per cent. Our Company’s balance sheet remains  strong, with a cash on hand of US$4.9 billion and net debt of  US$0.5 billion at 30 June 2024.  Reflecting an ongoing commitment to delivering  shareholder returns, the Board has declared a fully franked  final dividend of A$0.89 per share, bringing total dividends  declared for FY24 to A$1.97 per share. This represents a  payout ratio of 70 per cent of net profit after tax, in line with  the Company’s dividend policy to payout between 50 and   80 per cent of net profit after tax. Progress on decarbonisation was evident right across the  business throughout FY24. This includes construction of a  100MW solar farm at North Star Junction, commissioning  of our gaseous and liquid hydrogen facility at Christmas  Creek and the changeout of 120 airfield lights to solar at  our aerodrome at Cloudbreak. We also deployed our first  electric excavators which are now operating across our  sites, together with the development of a battery electric  and hydrogen fuel cell haul truck prototypes. The focus on  increasing energy efficiency across our sites resulted in a   10 per cent decrease from our forecast CO2 emissions in  FY24, which saws saw us exceed our FY24 stretch targets for  decarbonisation. In the Energy business, Fortescue took green energy  projects to final investment decision. We launched Arizona  Hydrogen, our green hydrogen plant in the United States,  and started work on Gladstone PEM50, a 50MW green  hydrogen project utilising Fortescue’s own electrolyser  technology. The Fortescue Board also agreed to fast-track  two more projects, enabling them to advance to feasibility  phase and commencement of the front end engineering  process. Holmaneset is a green ammonia project in Norway,  which has received backing and funding from the European  Union, and our Pecém Green Hydrogen Project in Brazil  advanced to feasibility phase, including commencement  of the front end engineering design process. In addition,  we have prospective projects being advanced in Oman,  Morocco, Jordan and Egypt. Progress on energy projects  resulted in a partial achievement of the stretch target.  In FY24, we also officially opened our Gladstone Electrolyser  Manufacturing Centre in Queensland and started selling our  electrolyser systems around the world. Through Fortescue  Zero, we are continuing to develop the solutions needed  to decarbonise industry. Sales contracts were executed  to new and existing customers for battery packs, battery  management systems and battery intelligence software. As the technology, energy and metals group accelerating the  commercial decarbonisation of industry, rapidly, profitably  and globally, we remain firmly focused on delivering against  our growth strategy to the benefit of all our stakeholders.  ===== PAGE 121 ===== 1.3 SAFETY US$4.9bn CASH ON HAND US$5.7bn NET PROFIT   AFTER TAX The following graphs show our Group performance against key financial measures in FY24: Revenue US$m Free cash flow US$m FORTESCUE METALS TOTAL  RECORDABLE INJURY  FREQUENCY RATE DIVERSITY 24.5% FEMALE   US$/wmt C1 Cost Shipments wmt  US$18.24/wmt C1 COST HEMATITE 191.6Mt SHIPMENTS TOTAL SHIPMENTS 18.24 FY24 13.93 FY20 FY21 15.91 FY22 17.54 12.94 FY23 FY24 191.6 FY22 192.0 FY21 FY20 182.2 178.2 189.0 FY23 FY21 FY20 FY24 FY22 12,820 22,284 17,390 16,871 18,220 FY23 FY22 8,961 FY20 5,108 FY24 3,572 FY21 4,449 4,317 FY23 Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    117 Operating and   financial review Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability climate change  report Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Overview Financial report  ===== PAGE 122 ===== The graphs below show Fortescue’s EBITDA vs ESSIP outcomes and relative TSR vs LTIP outcomes over the last five years.

INCENTIVE PLAN OPERATION The purpose of the ESSIP and LTIP is to incentivise and reward key Fortescue Executives (including KMP) for achieving  annual stretch Company and individual performance objectives that drive shareholder value. a.	 ESSIP Below we have set out the key terms of the ESSIP for FY24 (noting differences, where applicable, between Fortescue Metals  and Fortescue Energy ESSIP plans): Element Description Delivery At the start of the performance period, participants elect the portion of award they wish to receive in rights  with the remaining award to be delivered as cash. The plan allows executives to elect to receive up to 100 per  cent of awards in equity (a minimum of 50 per cent must be elected to be received by way of share rights).  Each share right, if vested, entitles the participant to an ordinary share in Fortescue for nil consideration. Performance   period One year (i.e. 1 July to 30 June) Valuing   awards The number of ESSIP share rights are calculated based on the VWAP of Fortescue shares traded over the  first five trading days of the performance period. As such: •  If the share price at the time of vesting is higher, Executives will receive higher value per share right. •  If the share price at the time of vesting is lower, the value to executives is decreased. The value of share rights is therefore aligned with shareholder interests from the beginning of the  performance period as executives receive value consistent with share price movements. Performance   measures The Board continues to recognise the importance of focusing on operational and strategic targets with  people and culture also being a key driver of success. In FY24, the Board set a number of challenging targets for Fortescue Metals and Fortescue Energy (noted  below). Where employees support both businesses, outcomes are based on 50 per cent Metals and 50 per  cent Energy performance.  The Board determined the relative weighting and mix of performance objectives for KMP and executives  to deliver long term sustainable shareholder value. Further details of performance measures for FY24 are  disclosed in Section 5. FORTESCUE METALS FORTESCUE ENERGY The Board set a number of challenging targets for  operations, including production, safety, cost and  revenue across all operating and support functions: •	 The operational measures were chosen as they  represent the key drivers of financial performance  (underlying EBITDA) of the Company and provide  a framework for delivering long term shareholder  value, irrespective of the iron ore price •	 The inclusion of a people and culture metric  recognises the importance of supporting the  Company’s differentiated culture underpinned by  its core Values, which is fundamental to corporate  success •	 Individual KPIs focus on critical objectives  and are set at stretch levels of performance  with measures and weightings aligned to the  individual’s ability to influence outcomes such as  the delivery of a project and business expansion. The Board set a number of challenging targets  specific to Fortescue Energy including safety,  delivery of projects in Australia and globally, as well  as Decarbonisation and Commercialisation across all  operating and support functions: •	 The measures were chosen as they represent the  key drivers of financial performance and provide  a framework for delivering long term shareholder  value •	 The inclusion of a people and culture metric  recognises the importance of supporting a culture  which is fundamental to success in Australia and  globally •	 Similar to Metals, individual KPIs focus on  critical objectives and are set at stretch levels of  performance with measures and weightings aligned  to the individual’s ability to influence outcomes such  as the delivery of a project and business expansion.  ===== PAGE 137 ===== Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    133 Operating and   financial review Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability climate change  report Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Overview Financial report Element Description Target setting Fortescue sets challenging ESSIP stretch targets and uses a sliding scale for each individual objective  with vesting available for threshold, target and stretch levels of performance. The sliding scale does not  apply to safety objectives which are either met or not met. When deliberating on performance outcomes,  the Board considers the level of achievement against targets and may approve a stretch award on each  KPI to reflect the degree of performance by the business. Whilst each individual KPI has the opportunity  to achieve stretch levels of performance, the overall outcome is capped at 100 per cent. Performance % of Target achieved % of Target awarded Below threshold <90% of Target Nil Threshold 90% of Target 10 Between threshold and target 95% of Target 50 Target 100% of Target 100 Stretch ≥120% of Target 150 Outcomes between performance levels are calculated on a linear basis. Board  discretion Awards under the ESSIP are at all times subject to the Board’s discretion. When deliberating on  performance outcomes, the Board follows a rigorous assessment process including:  •	 The degree of stretch in the measures and targets and the context in which the targets were set •	 The level of achievement against the stretch targets •	 The operating environment over the performance period and management’s ability to respond to  unforeseen events (i.e. cyclones, floods, fire, pandemic) •	 Financial performance and shareholder value generated •	 Global competitiveness and level of improvement compared to global peers during the period;  •	 The level of improvement across key business drivers on the prior year; and  •	 Any other relevant under or over performance or other criteria not stated above including how results  have been achieved.  In circumstances where performance against stretch targets is not accurately reflected in the level of  achievement against stretch targets (whether under or over), the Board may exercise its discretion to  increase or decrease the vesting level of the incentive and therefore the value awarded. This exercise of  discretion and the reasons for it will be clearly communicated in our Remuneration Report. b.	 LTIP The LTIP operates under the Performance Rights Plan Rules as approved by Shareholders at the Company’s Annual General  Meeting on 9 November 2021. The key terms of the FY24 LTIP are set out in the table below. Responding to feedback for improved disclosure, Strategic Measures for all ‘on-foot’ LTIP grants (FY22, FY23 and FY24) are  now included in the Remuneration Report. The strategic measures and outcomes for the FY22 grant are outlined in section 5,  and the strategic measures for the FY23 and FY24 LTIP are provided immediately below the FY24 LTIP key terms table.  ===== PAGE 138 ===== Directors’ report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    134 Element Description Delivery Share rights   Each share right entitles Executives (subject to achievement of the performance conditions) to  one fully paid ordinary share in Fortescue for nil consideration. Performance  period Three years Performance  measures –  summary The relative weighting between financial and strategic measures provides the ability to assess  performance across a cyclical market. The inclusion of strategic measures is deliberate to  ensure alignment between short and long-term value creation by ensuring long-term value is not  compromised. Performance measure breakdown   Total Shareholder Return (33%) Return on Equity (33%) Key Strategic Measures (34%) Each LTIP performance measure has a minimum performance hurdle for vesting with increasing  levels applicable to each individual measure. There is an ability to earn up to 150 per cent of any  individual measure by achieving stretch performance. Each individual measure contributes to the  overall result with vested rights awarded based on the aggregate of the three measures. A number of key changes will be implemented for FY25, including the removal of the ability to  earn up to 150 per cent on any individual measure, and the removal of ROE as a performance  measure.  Vesting between performance levels is calculated on a linear basis with the stretch element  considered together with the achievement of all performance measures and subject to the  aggregate performance cap. Whilst each individual performance measure includes stretch  targets, with a relative contribution on any individual measure of up to 150 per cent, the overall  cap for the LTIP is 100 per cent of the maximum number of share rights granted. Performance  and vesting  conditions Relative TSR performance measure Relative TSR is a measure of the performance of the Company’s shares over a three year period  against the ASX 100 Resources Index. It combines share price appreciation and dividends paid  to show the total return to the shareholder expressed as a percentage. Relative TSR hurdles are  valuable because the Company needs to outperform a peer group of participants to receive any  reward and therefore, is aligned to relative market performance. The comparator group for the FY24 grant comprises the companies in the ASX 100 Resources  Index. The ASX 100 Resources Index has been chosen as the comparator group because this is  a transparent market indicator, includes Fortescue’s ASX Listed commodity market peers and  represents the peer group that Fortescue competes with for investment.  When formulating the vesting schedule for the TSR performance measure, the Board  considered both local and international market practice. In line with the Company’s approach  to setting stretch targets, the Board determined that a vesting schedule more aggressive than  standard market practice was required in order to align executive reward for this performance  measure with superior shareholder returns. The vesting criteria for both threshold and target  have been set at the 60th percentile and 80th percentile (respectively), higher than standard  market practice. The plan also provides for a premium grant of awards (subject to the cap  described above) where Fortescue delivers the market leading total shareholder return over the  performance period. The TSR vesting schedule is as follows: Key Terms of the FY24 LTIP:  ===== PAGE 139 ===== Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    135 Operating and   financial review Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability climate change  report Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Overview Financial report Element Description Performance  and vesting  conditions  (continued) LTIP TSR target and vesting schedule Performance Average TSR Portion of tranche that vests Below threshold Below the 60th percentile Nil Threshold At the 60th percentile 25% of share rights vest Target At the 80th percentile 100% of share rights vest Stretch At the 100th percentile 150% of share rights vest Outcomes between performance levels are calculated on a linear basis. The Board acknowledge that a relative TSR hurdle can result in unintended outcomes. The intent is to  ensure no windfall gains or undue penalty. In the event that TSR is negative, but the relative TSR hurdle is  achieved, the Board will consider overall performance and circumstances and may, at its absolute discretion,  reduce the level of vesting or determine that no award will be made with respect to the TSR measure. ROE performance measure ROE has been used as a measure in Fortescue’s LTIP for some time now and measures how effectively  management is using Fortescue’s assets to create profits. The ROE vesting schedule is as follows: LTIP ROE target and vesting schedule Performance ROE Portion of tranche that vests Below threshold <25% Nil Threshold 25% 25% of share rights vest Target 30% 100% of share rights vest Stretch >35% 150% of share rights vest Outcomes between performance levels are calculated on a linear basis. Strategic Measures  Strategic measures are aimed at directing performance toward the achievement of the Company’s long- term strategic objectives and not focusing on annual short-term goals alone. The strategic objectives  devised by the Board specifically relate to key milestones and objectives that are fundamental to the  Company’s sustainability, continuing development and growth and delivery of shareholder value.  In line with the recommendations of the People, Remuneration and Nomination Committee, the LTIP  performance measures comprise strategic measures with associated key performance indicators for  the Company aimed at directing performance towards the Company’s long-term objectives (Strategic  Objectives).  In response to feedback, a more fulsome disclosure of the strategic measures has been included. The  strategic measures for the FY24 grant are set out below.  Whether a strategic objective has been achieved is measured at the end of the three-year performance  period on an outcome basis (and subject to Board discretion) with vesting as follows: LTIP Strategic Measure target and vesting schedule Performance Score Portion of tranche that vests Below threshold <5 Nil Threshold 5 25% of share rights vest Target 10 100% of share rights vest Stretch 15 150% of share rights vest Board   discretion Awards under the LTIP are at all times subject to the Board’s absolute discretion.  ===== PAGE 140 ===== Directors’ report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    136 FY23 LTIP Strategic Measures  The table below summarises Strategic Measures for the FY23 LTIP. For other key terms relating to the FY23 LTIP please refer  to Fortescue’s FY23 Annual Report.

The table below summarises Strategic Measures for the FY24 LTIP. Fortescue Pilbara Iron Ore Create a pathway for an incremental 200Mt of iron ore inventory through submitted referrals/approvals so that the tonnes  are available to be scheduled as part of the Fortescue Life of Mine Plan, subject to Native Title Party resourcing. Metals Growth Belinga Iron Ore Project Complete scoping study and progress pre-feasibility in line with Board approved parameters Critical Minerals Critical minerals activities progressed with a pipeline of exploration and advanced development projects in Copper,  Lithium and / or Rare Earth Elements (REEs). Energy Achieved three value accretive green energy projects with construction complete and commissioning commenced in line  with Board approved scope, budget and timeframe. Technology Fortescue WAE (now Fortescue Zero) to achieve EBITDA target. Fortescue Hydrogen Systems to achieve EBITDA target. >15 AI projects delivered with target ROI over three years, and >500 people trained in advanced machine learning. Fortescue Capital Build the Fortescue Capital team and brand to serve as a catalyst for the business for green hydrogen and decarbonisation  and to market specific investment opportunities generated by Metals or Energy.  ===== PAGE 142 ===== Directors’ report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    138 Element ESSIP LTIP What  happens on  cessation of  employment Unless the Board exercises its discretion under the  ESSIP rules, for individuals who leave during the year  (i.e. before 30 June) the ESSIP is pro-rated based  on service during the period, and made at the usual  payment date, which is around September of each  year, post release of audited and approved full year  results.  Individuals who commence during the year similarly  will have awards under the ESSIP pro-rated based on  service during the performance period. Unless the Board exercises its discretion under  the plan rules, on cessation participants may be  entitled to retain a pro rata portion of unvested  performance rights, which may vest, subject to  satisfaction of the applicable vesting conditions,  in accordance with the original terms of their  grant at the end of the vesting period. Clawback  policy Fortescue operates a Clawback policy which applies to both the ESSIP and LTIP. Clawback will be initiated  where in the opinion of the Board: •	 a participant has engaged in fraud, dishonesty or gross misconduct, breached his or her obligations to  the Group or there is a material misstatement of financial information •	 an Award, which would not have otherwise vested, vests or may vest as a result of the fraud, dishonesty  or breach of obligations of any other person •	 circumstances have occurred that result in an unfair benefit being obtained by any participant. The Board’s discretion, with respect to the operation of the Clawback Policy, is considered standard  market practice and an appropriate mechanism to ensure the Board has sufficient flexibility to respond to  changing or unexpected circumstances (should they arise). Change of  control The performance period end date will generally be brought forward to the date of the change of control  and awards will vest over this shortened period, subject to ultimate Board discretion. C.	 General terms applying to equity awards The occurrence of particular events may affect the grant and vesting of the ESSIP and LTIP equity awards. The table below  outlines how these awards may be addressed, noting that the Board at all times maintains an overriding and absolute  discretion with respect to the incentive plans:  ===== PAGE 143 ===== Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    139 Operating and   financial review Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability climate change  report Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Overview Financial report Position Executive TFR (A$)1 Maximum ESSIP  opportunity Maximum LTIP  opportunity Nominal  value of total  remuneration  package at  maximum  opportunity A$ % of TFR A$ % of TFR A$ Executive Director  and Fortescue Global  Ambassador E Gaines² 500,000 - - - - 500,000 Fortescue Metals CEO D Otranto³ 1,750,000 112.5 1,968,750 150 2,625,000 6,343,750 Fortescue Energy CEO M Hutchinson 2,080,000 112.5 2,340,000 150 3,120,000 7,540,000 Group CFO A Paget⁴ 840,000 75 525,000 100 700,000 2,065,000 Chief Corporate Officer S Robertson⁵ 725,000 75 543,750 100 725,000 1,993,750 Fortescue Metals CEO F Hick⁶ 2,080,000 112.5 2,340,000 150 3,120,000 7,540,000 Fortescue Metals CFO C Morris⁷ 1,150,000 75 862,500 100 1,150,000 3,162,500 The Executive Chairman does not receive a salary or participate in any incentive plans and as such has not been included in the table. ¹ Includes superannuation and allowances.

NED Salary Sacrifice Share Rights Plan NEDs may choose to sacrifice a portion or all of their base fees (excluding Committee fees and Company superannuation  contributions) to be used to acquire vested rights to Fortescue shares under the Non-Executive Director Salary Sacrifice Share  Rights Plan. Shares, to the gross value of the amount salary sacrificed, are purchased on market twice a year following the announcement of  Fortescue’s half and full year results in February and August. The VWAP purchased is used to determine the number of vested rights to be allocated to Non-Executive Directors. Vested rights  may be exercised at any time, up to 15 years from date of grant. Shares will be held by Pacific Custodians (as Trustee) until the vested rights are exercised into shares. Vested rights and shares  acquired under this Plan are not subject to performance conditions because they are issued in lieu of salary which would  otherwise be payable to the relevant Non-Executive Director. c.	 NED Travel Allowance A NED Travel Allowance was introduced in FY24 to recognise the increasingly global footprint of Fortescue, the geographic  spread of directors, and as a mechanism to attract global candidates for director positions. This allowance does not apply to  the Chair, Deputy Chair, or Executive Director. The allowance applies to attendance at Board meetings only and is limited to  international travel. The amount payable depends on flight duration (one-way). For international flights greater than five hours  but less than 10 hours the allowance is A$7,500 and for international flights of more than 10 hours the allowance is A$15,000, with  only one allowance paid per round trip.   8.	 NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR  REMUNERATION a.	 NED remuneration policy and fees Fortescue’s policy on Non-Executive Director (NED) remuneration requires that NED fees are: •	 Not ‘at risk’ to reflect the nature of their responsibilities and safeguard their independence; and •	 Market competitive with fees set at levels comparable with NED remuneration of comparable companies. The maximum aggregate remuneration payable to NEDs is A$4.5 million, which was approved by shareholders at the  Annual General Meeting on 22 November 2022.  Most NEDs receive fees for both Board and Committee membership. The payment of additional fees for serving on a  Committee recognises the additional time commitment required by NEDs who serve on a Committee.  ===== PAGE 145 ===== Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    141 Operating and   financial review Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability climate change  report Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Overview Financial report 9.	 REMUNERATION GOVERNANCE Fortescue believes that robust governance is critical to underpinning the effectiveness of the remuneration strategy. a.	 Remuneration and People Committee The Remuneration and People Committee (RPC) operates under a Board-approved Charter. The purpose of the RPC is to  provide assistance and recommendations to the Board to ensure that it is able to fulfil its responsibilities. The RPC in FY24 consisted solely of non-executive directors. The chief executive officer and others may be invited to  attend all or part of meetings by the RPC Chair as required but have no vote on matters before the Committee. A copy of the RPC Charter is available from the Corporate Governance section of our website at fortescue.com  REMUNERATION CONSULTANTS •  May be engaged directly by the Board or RPC to provide  advice or information relating to KMP that is free from  influence of management. •  Will be engaged directly by management other than in  respect of KMP to provide data to ensure Fortescue’s  remuneration position remains competitive. During the year ended 30 June 2024, the Committee  sought advice from remuneration consultants from   time to time for remuneration advisory services.   This did not involve providing the RPC with any  remuneration recommendations as defined by   the Corporations Act 2001. BOARD OF DIRECTORS •  Approve the remuneration of   Non-Executive Directors and CEO •  Ensure remuneration practices are  competitive and strategic and align  with the attraction and retention  policies of the Company Board of  Directors Human Resources  Management Remuneration Consultants Board Remuneration  and People  Committee BOARD REMUNERATION AND   PEOPLE COMMITTEE Advise the Board on: •  Remuneration strategy, policies and practices •  NED and senior executive remuneration •  Committee member appointments  •  Senior executive recruitment and the Company’s  recruitment, ESSIP, LTIP, retention and termination  policies and annual performance reviews •  Succession planning and talent management •  Diversity strategy and gender pay equity  HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT •  Implement of remuneration policies   and practices •  Advise the RPC of changing statutory and  market conditions •  Provide relevant information to the RPC to  assist with decisions b.	 Minimum shareholding conditions All Directors and employees are encouraged to own Fortescue shares and the Company enables employee participation as a  shareholder through short and long-term incentives, salary sacrifice and dividend reinvestment programs. A minimum shareholding policy applies to directors and executives to support a long-term focus and further strengthen  alignment with shareholders. The minimum shareholding required is as follows: Non-Executive Directors: 100% of annual base fee CEO¹: 200% of total fixed remuneration Other Executive KMP: 100% of total fixed remuneration ¹ Applies to both Fortescue Metals and Fortescue Energy CEOs. Participants are required to meet their respective minimum shareholding within a reasonable timeframe, generally within five  years from the effective date of the policy, or the date of their appointment, if later. The Directors’ and Executives’ Shareholding Policy can be accessed from the Corporate Governance section of our website at  fortescue.com c.	 Board discretion The committee and the Board consider it critical that they are able to exercise full and appropriate discretion in order to ensure  that remuneration outcomes for executives appropriately reflect the performance of individuals, the Group, and meet the  expectations of shareholders. d.	 Securities Trading Policy Fortescue’s Securities Trading Policy provides guidance on how Company securities may be dealt with. The Securities Trading  Policy details acceptable and unacceptable periods for trading in Company Securities including detailing potential civil and  criminal penalties for misuse of confidential information. Fortescue’s Securities Trading Policy provides guidance on acceptable transactions in dealing in the Company’s various  securities, including shares, debt notes and options. The policy also sets out a specific governance approach for how the Chairman and directors can deal in Company Securities.

KMP share rights Share rights granted under the ESSIP at the beginning of FY24 (granted at the VWAP for Fortescue shares traded over  the first five trading days of the performance year) based on the participants election of performance rights (ranging  from a minimum of 50 per cent up to a maximum of 100 per cent). Share rights granted under the LTIP at the beginning of  FY22 which vested in FY24 are shown below. The ultimate value of these share rights to the Executives will reflect either  an improvement or decline in the Company’s share price over the performance period.

01  Basis of preparation The financial statements cover the consolidated group  comprising of Fortescue Ltd (formerly Fortescue Metals  Group Ltd; the Company) and its subsidiaries, together  referred to as Fortescue or the Group. The Company is a  for-profit company limited by shares and incorporated  in Australia, whose shares are publicly traded on the  Australian Stock Exchange.  These general purpose financial statements have been  prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting  Standards, other authoritative pronouncements  of the Australian Accounting Standards Board  (AASB), including Australian Interpretations, and  the Corporations Act 2001.  The financial statements for the year ended 30 June  2024 were authorised for issue in accordance with a  Directors’ resolution on 28 August 2024.  (a) Compliance with IFRS  The financial statements of the Group also comply with  International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as  issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.  (b) Historical cost convention  The financial statements have been prepared under the  historical cost convention, except for certain financial  instruments, which have been measured at fair value.  (c) Functional and presentation currency  The financial statements are presented in United States  dollars, which is the Group’s reporting currency and the  functional currency of the Company and the majority of  its significant subsidiaries.  (d) Critical accounting estimates  The preparation of financial statements requires  management to use estimates, judgements and  assumptions. Application of different assumptions  and estimates may have a significant impact on  Fortescue’s net assets and financial results. Estimates  and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis  and are based on the latest available information at  each reporting date. Actual results may differ from the  estimates.  The areas involving a higher degree of judgement and  complexity, or areas where assumptions are significant  to the financial statements are:  • Iron ore reserve estimates  • Exploration and evaluation expenditure - recoverable  amount • Development expenditure - recoverable amount • Property, plant and equipment - recoverable amount  • Rehabilitation estimates  • Revenue • Joint arrangements • Fair value measurement of financial assets. The accounting estimates and judgements applied to  these areas are disclosed in note 24.  (e) Rounding of amounts  All amounts in the financial statements have been  rounded to the nearest million dollars, except as  indicated, in accordance with the ASIC Corporations  Instrument 2016/191.

The following operating segments have been  identified:  • Metals: Exploration, development, production,  processing, sale and transportation of iron ore, and the  exploration for other minerals. • Energy: Undertaking activities in the global  development of green electricity, green hydrogen,  green ammonia projects, as well as green technology  development and manufacturing.  Corporate includes cash, intercompany loans which  eliminate at consolidation, debt and tax balances which  are managed at a Group level together with other  corporate activities. Corporate is not considered to be an  operating segment and includes activities that are not  allocated to other operating segments. Transfer prices between segments are set on an arm’s  length basis in a manner similar to transactions with  third parties. Where segment revenue, expenses and  results include transactions between segments, those  transactions are eliminated on consolidation and are not  considered material. (a) Underlying EBITDA Fortescue uses Underlying EBITDA defined as earnings  before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation,  exploration, development and other expenses, and  impairment expense, as a key measure of its financial  performance. The reconciliation of Underlying EBITDA to  the net profit after tax is presented below. The segment  information is prepared in conformity with the Group’s  accounting policies.

Shipping revenue and the provisional pricing adjustments to shipping revenue are recognised over the period during  which the shipping service has been provided.  2Manufacturing and engineering services revenue is earned from contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised  when control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer (over time or at a point in time) at an amount  that reflects the consideration to which the Group is entitled in exchange for those goods or services. 3Other revenue includes towage services provided by Fortescue which is recognised as performed. 04 Other income 2024 2023 US$m US$m Net foreign exchange gain – 48 Grants income 7 – Other 38 5 45 53  ===== PAGE 164 ===== Financial report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    160 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE  05 Cost of sales 2024 2023 US$m US$m Mining and processing costs 3,102 2,856 Rail costs 288 266 Port costs 278 251 Shipping costs 1,531 1,455 Government royalty 1,209 1,124 Depreciation and amortisation 2,098 1,708 Manufacturing and engineering services costs 97 76 Other operating expenses 70 81 8,673 7,817 Total employee benefits expense included in cost of sales, administration expenses and research expenditure is  US$1,847 million (2023: US$1,754 million). 06 Other expenses 2024 2023 US$m US$m Administration expenses 416 288 Research expenditure 495 553 Impairment expense1 – 1,037 Exploration, development and other 96 170 Depreciation and amortisation 46 36 Fair value change in financial instruments 10 3 Net foreign exchange loss 31 – Other 9 – 1,103 2,087 1Impairment expense relates to the impairment of the Iron Bridge CGU in prior year ended 30 June 2023 as described in note 12(a).

Fortescue’s capital includes total equity and net debt. Net debt is defined as borrowings and lease liabilities less cash  and cash equivalents. 2024 2023 Note US$m US$m Borrowings 9(a) 4,585 4,587 Lease liabilities 9(a) 815 734 Cash and cash equivalents 9(b) (4,903) (4,287) Net debt 497 1,034 Equity attributable to equity holders of the Company 19,552 17,989 Non-controlling interest (21) 9 Total equity 19,531 17,998 Capital management involves a continuous process of:  • Evaluating capital requirements against the risks arising from Fortescue’s activities and its operating environment   • Raising, refinancing and repaying debt   • Development, maintenance and implementation of the dividend policy.  Fortescue has developed target ranges for a number of financial indicators. These indicators include gearing, net  gearing, debt to Underlying EBITDA and interest coverage ratio, and are monitored together with a number of  other financial and non-financial indicators. Target ranges for the financial ratios may vary upon the investment  and commodity cycles. During periods of intensive investment, for example expansion programs, or a commodity  downturn, the capital management policy contemplates interim ratio levels returning to a targeted longer term level.  Interim levels acknowledge and consider the requirements, in certain circumstances, for remedial actions to be taken.  As per previous disclosures, Fortescue has a share buy-back program in place that is an important part of the capital  management strategy. The program was put in place in 2018 and was extended in October 2020 for an unlimited  duration.

The  remaining trade and other receivables are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less an  allowance for impairment. The Group applies the expected credit loss model to all receivables not held at fair value through profit or loss. A  provision for doubtful receivables is established based on the expected credit loss model and reviewed on an ongoing  basis. Expected credit losses on trade and other receivables held at amortised cost amount to US$4 million as at 30 June  2024 for which a full provision has been recognised (2023: nil).

Fortescue has  established a risk management framework that provides a structured approach to the identification and control of  risks across the business, sets the appropriate risk tolerance levels and incorporates active management of financial  risks. The risk management framework has been approved by the Board of Directors, through the Audit, Finance and  Risk Management Committee. The day-to-day management responsibility for execution of the risk management  framework has been delegated to the Metals CEO, Energy CEO and Group CFO. Periodically, the Group CFO reports to  the Audit, Finance and  Risk Management Committee on risk management performance, including management of  financial risks.  The key elements of financial risk are further explained below. (a) Market risk Market risk arises from Fortescue’s exposure to commodity price risk and the use of interest bearing and foreign  currency financial instruments. It is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will  fluctuate because of changes in iron ore price (commodity price risk), interest rates (interest rate risk) or foreign  exchange rates (foreign currency exchange risk). (i) Commodity price risk Fortescue is exposed to commodity price risk, as its iron ore sales are predominantly subject to prevailing market  prices. Fortescue does not directly influence market prices of iron ore and manages the commodity price risk through  a focus on improving its cash margins and strengthening its corporate balance sheet through refinancing and early  debt repayments.  The majority of Fortescue’s iron ore sales contracts are structured on a provisional pricing basis, with the final sales  price determined using the iron ore price indices on or after the vessel’s arrival to the port at discharge. The estimated  consideration in relation to the provisionally priced contracts is marked to market using the spot iron ore price at  the end of each reporting period, with the impact of the iron ore price movements recorded as provisional pricing  adjustments to revenue. At 30 June 2024, Fortescue had 4.6 million tonnes of iron ore sales (2023: 2.6 million tonnes)  that remained subject to provisional pricing, with the final price to be determined in the following financial year.  A two per cent movement in the realised iron ore price on these provisionally priced sales would have an impact on  the Group’s profit of US$6 million (2023: three per cent movement would have an impact on the Group’s profit of  US$6 million), before the impact of taxation. This analysis assumes all other factors, including the foreign currency  exchange rates, are held constant.  ===== PAGE 174 ===== Financial report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    170 Notes to the consolidated financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2024 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 11 Financial risk management (continued) (a) Market risk (continued) (ii) Interest rate risk The Group’s interest rate risk arises from variable rates on the syndicated term loan, the revolving credit facility to the  extent it is drawn, and the lease liabilities relating to the ore carriers. Changes in rates applicable to the short-term  deposits forming part of cash and cash equivalents also give rise to interest rate risk. Fortescue’s policy is to reduce interest rate risk over the cash flows on its long-term debt funding through the use of  fixed rate instruments whenever appropriate.  Fortescue’s variable rate financial assets and liabilities at the end of the financial year are summarised below: 2024 2023 Note US$m US$m Cash and cash equivalents 9(b) 1,815 2,693 Syndicated term loan 9(a) (968) (975) Lease liabilities (267) (294) 580 1,424 Management analyses the Group’s interest rate exposure on a regular basis by simulating various scenarios which  take into consideration refinancing, renewal of existing positions, alternative financing options and hedging.  A change of 25 basis points in interest rates in variable instruments would have an impact on the Group’s profit of   US$1 million (2023: a change of 50 basis points would impact profit by US$7 million), before the impact of taxation. This analysis assumes that all other factors remain constant, including foreign currency rates. (iii) Foreign currency exchange risk  Fortescue operates in Australia with a significant portion of its operating costs and capital expenditure incurred and  paid in Australian dollars, and as such, is exposed to the movements in the Australian dollar exchange rate. Fortescue’s risk management policy is to target specific levels at which to convert United States dollars to Australian  dollars by entering into either spot or short-term forward exchange contracts or structured foreign currency option  arrangements (i.e. collars) to fix a portion of the Group’s Australian dollar exposure to within a Board-approved range.  The Group has not applied hedge accounting to any of these contracts during the year.   ===== PAGE 175 ===== Financial report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    171 Overview Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability climate change  report Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Operating and   financial review Notes to the consolidated financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2024 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 11 Financial risk management (continued) (iii) Foreign currency exchange risk (continued) The carrying amounts of the financial assets and liabilities denominated in Australian dollars and Chinese Yuan (CNY)  (expressed in US dollars), are set out below: AUD denominated CNY denominated 2024 2023 2024 2023 US$m US$m US$m US$m Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 828 945 222 436 Trade and other receivables 59 201 – – Other financial assets 52 72 – – Total financial assets 939 1,218 222 436 Financial liabilities Borrowings and lease liabilities 416 392 2 – Trade and other payables 864 891 10 13 Current tax payable 259 304 – – Total financial liabilities 1,539 1,587 12 13 A change of two per cent in the Australian dollar exchange rate would have a net impact on the Group’s profit of US$12  million (2023: a change of two per cent would have an impact of US$7 million), before the impact of taxation. A change  of two per cent in the Chinese Yuan exchange rate would have a net impact on the Group’s profit of US$4 million  (2023: a change of two per cent would have an impact of US$8 million), before the impact of taxation. This analysis  assumes that all other variables, including interest rates and iron ore price, remain constant. (b) Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to  Fortescue and is managed on a consolidated basis. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, deposits with  banks and financial institutions and receivables from customers.  Contracts for iron ore sales allow for pricing mechanisms in which the price can be finalised over multiple periods.  On this basis, the Group does not consider in the first instance that the ageing of receivables is an indicator of risk of  default, rather an indication of the contractual terms and conditions agreed within the sales contract.  The Group’s exposure to customer credit risk for trade receivables other than iron ore trade receivables is influenced  mainly by the individual characteristics of each customers. Contracts for iron ore sales are completed under Letter  of Credit. New customers are analysed individually for creditworthiness, taking into account credit ratings where  available, previous trading experience and other factors. In monitoring customer credit risk, customers are assessed  individually by their debtor ageing profile. Monitoring of receivable balances on an ongoing basis minimises the  exposure to bad debts. Historically, bad debt write-offs have been insignificant. At 30 June 2024, the Group had US$5 million (2023: US$2 million) of trade receivables which have not been settled  within the normal terms and conditions agreed with the customer. The Group applies a forward-looking expected  credit loss model. To measure the expected credit losses, these trade receivables have been grouped based on  shared credit risk characteristics. Fortescue allocates each group of trade receivables to a credit risk grade based on  data that is determined to be predictive of the risk of loss including but not limited to external ratings and available  press information about customers. Credit risk grades are defined using qualitative and quantitative factors that are  indicative of the risk of default and are aligned to external credit rating definitions from agencies. The Group assesses  expected credit losses by considering the risk of default modified for credit enhancements such as letters of credit  obtained. On this basis, the resulting expected credit loss on trade receivables is not material.  ===== PAGE 176 ===== Financial report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    172 Notes to the consolidated financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2024 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT 11 Financial risk management (continued) (b) Credit risk (continued) Fortescue has recognised bad debt expense from trading counterparties of US$4 million for the year ended 30 June  2024 (2023: nil). The exposure to the credit risk from cash and short-term deposits held in banks is managed by the Group's Treasury  department and monitored by the Group CFO. Fortescue minimises the credit risks by holding funds with a range of  financial institutions with credit ratings approved by the Board. (c) Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due. Fortescue  manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and banking facilities, by continuously monitoring actual  and forecast cash flows and by matching the maturity profiles of its assets and liabilities.  The table below analyses Fortescue’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the period to the  contracted maturity date.

The senior unsecured  notes are classified as level 1 financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy, with their fair values based on quoted  market prices at the end of the financial year, as outlined below. 2024 2023 Carrying value Fair value Carrying value Fair value US$m US$m US$m US$m Senior unsecured notes 2,814 2,599 2,810 2,504 Green senior unsecured  notes 803 790 802 760 The Group enters into derivative financial instruments (foreign currency options and commodity swap contracts) with  various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment-grade credit ratings. It also recognises trade  receivables in relation to its provisionally priced iron ore sales contracts at fair value. All derivatives and provisionally  priced iron ore trade receivables are valued using valuation techniques which employ the use of market observable  inputs, such as foreign exchange spot and forward rates, yield curves of the respective currencies, interest rate curves  and forward rate curves of the underlying commodity. Accordingly, these instruments are classified as Level 2. Refer  to note 10(a) for the fair value of provisionally priced iron ore trade receivables as at 30 June 2024. For all fair value measurements and disclosures, the Group uses the following levels to categorise the method used:  Level 1:  the fair value is calculated using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.  Level 2:  the fair value is estimated using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable  for the asset or liability, either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices).  Level 3:  inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data. The Group does not have any  financial assets or liabilities in this category. For financial instruments that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers  have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that  is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period. There were no transfers  between levels during the year.  ===== PAGE 178 ===== Financial report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    174 Notes to the consolidated financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2024 KEY BALANCE SHEET ITEMS 12 Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (a) Property, plant and equipment Right of use assets Plant and  equipment Land and  buildings Exploration  and  evaluation Assets under  development Development Plant and  equipment Land and  buildings Total US$m US$m US$m US$m US$m US$m US$m US$m Net carrying  value At 1 July 2022 9,671 584 758 5,157 3,548 822 110 20,650 Transfers of assets 1,662 85 (2) (2,083) 267 – – (71) Additions 11 1 159 2,831 – 85 56 3,143 Disposals and  write-offs (46) – (100) – – – – (146) Depreciation (1,224) (59) – – (298) (142) (16) (1,739) Impairment – – – (1,037) – – – (1,037) Changes in  restoration and  rehabilitation  estimate¹ – – – – 171 – – 171 Other – – – 8 (5) – – 3 At 30 June 2023 10,074 611 815 4,876 3,683 765 150 20,974 Cost 20,679 1,285 815 4,876 6,101 1,370 193 35,319 Accumulated  depreciation and  impairment (10,605) (674) – – (2,418) (605) (43) (14,345) Net carrying  value At 1 July 2023 10,074 611 815 4,876 3,683 765 150 20,974 Transfers of assets 4,048 142 (13) (4,849) 562 – – (110) Additions 25 30 190 2,576 – 147 80 3,048 Disposals and  write-offs (48) – (37) – (6) – – (91) Depreciation (1,591) (63) – – (283) (125) (27) (2,089) Impairment – – – – – – – – Changes in  restoration and  rehabilitation  estimate¹ – – – – (53) – – (53) Other – – – 8 (5) – – 3 At 30 June 2024 12,508 720 955 2,611 3,898 787 203 21,682 Cost 24,704 1,457 955 2,611 6,599 1,517 273 38,116 Accumulated  depreciation and  impairment (12,196) (737) – – (2,701) (730) (70) (16,434) ¹ Refer to note 13(a) for movements in the restoration and rehabilitation provision.

For the financial year  ended 30 June 2024, the Group’s assessment of its CGUs identified no indicators of impairment and concluded that  an impairment test was not required. For the financial year ended 30 June 2023, indicators of impairment of the Iron Bridge CGU were identified and  accordingly, an impairment test of the Iron Bridge CGU was performed by assessing its fair value less cost of disposal  (FVLCD) compared to its carrying amount (refer to note 24(d)(i)). This resulted in the recognition of a pre-tax  impairment expense of US$1,037 million in the 30 June 2023 financial results. The table below summarises the key judgement and estimates that may impact the carrying value of the Iron Bridge  CGU for the next 12 months as at 30 June 2024:        Price for Iron  Bridge product Published third-party forecast prices available for the 65% Fe Index are used as the basis for future Iron  Bridge product pricing, with a grade adjustment to 67% Fe, and incorporates an additional long-term  premium to reflect product value and increasing demand for energy efficient magnetite product.  Operating cost Operating cost for the ramp up period and long term are based on internal budgets and forecasts based on  life of mine plans. In determining the FVLCD, cash flows related to operating costs and capital expenditures  to enhance productivity or reduce costs are included.  Production  output Production volumes are based on detailed life of mine plans factoring in current resources and reserves,  recoverable quantities of ore, environmental and heritage factors. Exchange rates  AUD/USD Long term exchange rates are derived with reference to analyst consensus which involves market analysis  including equity analyst estimates and internal management estimates.  Discount rates In calculating FVLCD, a post-tax nominal discount rate is applied to the post tax cash flows. The discount  rate is impacted by the risk-free rate and other benchmark interest rates. The discount rate takes into  account both debt and equity. The cost of equity is derived from the expected return on investment by  the Group’s investors. The cost of debt is based on its interest-bearing borrowings the Group is obliged  to service. Segment-specific risk is incorporated by applying individual beta factors. The beta factors are  evaluated annually based on publicly available market data. Summary: No impairment indicators were identified for the Group’s CGUs for the financial year ended 30 June 2024. For  the financial year ended 30 June 2023, an impairment expense of US$1,037 million (post tax: US$726 million)  was recognised for the Iron Bridge CGU reflecting the differences between the carrying amount and the FVLCD  recoverable amount.   ===== PAGE 180 ===== Financial report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    176 Notes to the consolidated financial statements   For the year ended 30 June 2024 KEY BALANCE SHEET ITEMS 12 Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets (continued) (b) Intangible assets Goodwill Other  intangible  assets Total  US$m US$m US$m Net carrying value At 1 July 2022 199 58 257 Transfers – 71 71 Additions – 25 25 Disposals – (14) (14) Adjustment to subsidiary purchase consideration (4) – (4) Amortisation – (36) (36) At 30 June 2023 195 104 299 Cost  195 321 516 Accumulated amortisation – (217) (217) Net carrying value At 1 July 2023 195 104 299 Transfers – 88 88 Additions – 56 56 Disposals – – – Amortisation – (55) (55) At 30 June 2024 195 193 388 Cost  195 465 660 Accumulated amortisation – (272) (272) In considering impairment, the goodwill recognised from the acquisition of Fortescue Zero (formerly Fortescue  WAE) by Fortescue is allocated to the CGUs expected to benefit from Fortescue Zero’s battery electric technology.  Fortescue has allocated the goodwill to its Pilbara Operations CGU reflecting the electrification of its mining and rail  fleet. The Group has considered the recoverability of the goodwill in respect to current and forecasted financial  performance of the Pilbara Operations CGU and noted no indications that the goodwill needs to be impaired.  ===== PAGE 181 ===== Financial report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    177 Overview Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability climate change  report Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Operating and   financial review 13 Provisions 2024 2023 US$m US$m Employee benefits 489 436 Restoration and rehabilitation 7 4 Others 12 5 Total current provisions 508 445 Employee benefits 5 4 Restoration and rehabilitation 1,021 1,059 Total non-current provisions 1,026 1,063 (a) Provision for restoration and rehabilitation  Movements in the provision for restoration and rehabilitation during the financial year are set out below: 2024 2023 US$m US$m At 1 July 1,063 912 Changes in restoration and rehabilitation estimate (53) 171 Unwinding of discount  19 2 Payments for restoration and rehabilitation activities (1) (22) At 30 June 1,028 1,063 The provision for restoration and rehabilitation has been made in full for all disturbed areas at the reporting date based  on current cost estimates for rehabilitation and infrastructure removal, discounted to their present value based on  expected timing of future cash flows.

The Company’s effective corporate  income tax rate is reflective of the statutory corporate income tax rates in each jurisdiction. The majority of the  Group’s taxes are paid in Australia consistent with the location of its mining operations. The Australian Group includes  Fortescue’s wholly owned Australian entities.  For the year ended 30 June 2024, the Group’s global effective tax rate was 31.8 per cent. This is in line with the Australian  corporate tax rate of 30 per cent.

(d) Deferred tax assets and liabilities  Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the difference between the carrying value of assets and liabilities  compared to their income tax base. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the relevant tax rates enacted  for the reporting period. Fortescue’s main operations are in Australia and therefore the main taxable income arises  in Australia. The Company’s major deferred tax assets and liabilities also arise in Australia, predominantly relating to  capital investments in the Pilbara region.

The Group  recognises the benefit of tax losses only to the extent of anticipated future taxable income or gains in relevant  jurisdictions. Of the US$438 million of tax losses, US$115 million expires not later than 10 years and US$12 million  expires later than 10 years and not later than 20 years. The remaining tax losses and tax credits do not expire.  ===== PAGE 185 ===== Financial report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    181 Overview Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability climate change  report Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Operating and   financial review Notes to the consolidated financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2024 UNRECOGNISED ITEMS  15 Commitments and contingencies Contingent liabilities represent a possible obligation arising from past events and whose existence will be confirmed  only by occurrence or non-occurrence of uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group. These are  not provided for on the balance sheet where the likelihood of the contingent liability is assessed as possible rather  than probable or remote. Contingent liabilities may also be a present obligation arising from past events but is not recognised on the basis that  an outflow of economic resources to settle the obligation is not viewed as probable, or the amount of the obligation  cannot be reliably measured.  (i)  Contingent assets and liabilities On 26 August 2022, Fortescue joined the Native Title Compensation Claim proceedings brought by the Yindjibarndi  Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation (YNAC) against the State of Western Australia in the Federal Court of Australia. At the  date of this report, the total quantum of compensation sought in the proceedings remains unclear. The Court has  issued a timetable for the proceedings which includes several hearings. The first hearing (for opening submissions  and on-country evidence) was held in August 2023, the second hearing (for expert and lay evidence) was held in  April 2024, a third hearing (for remaining expert evidence) will be in October 2024 and the final hearing (for closing  submissions) will be in February 2025.  Fortescue remains open to negotiating a Land Access Agreement to the benefit of all Yindjibarndi people on similar  terms to the agreements it has in place with other native title groups in the region.  Fortescue occasionally receives claims arising from its activities in the normal course of business. It is expected that  any liabilities arising from such claims would not have a material effect on the Group’s operating results or financial  position. The Group has issued a number of bank and other performance guarantees for various operational and legal  purposes related to its own future performance, which are in the normal course of business. It is not expected that  these guarantees will be called on. No liabilities were recognised by the parent entity or the Group in relation to these  guarantees. Refer to note 21(b) for further details of guarantees entered into by the parent entity.

The parent entity’s financial information has been prepared using the same basis, including the accounting policies,  as the consolidated financial information, except as outlined below:  • Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint operations have been accounted for at cost, less accumulated  impairment losses in the balance sheet; and  • Profit for the year includes dividends received from subsidiaries of US$6,080 million (2023: US$4,028 million). (b) Guarantees entered into by the parent entity The parent entity, Fortescue Ltd, is a party to the deed of cross guarantee as described in note 20 and has provided a  guarantee to an unrelated party in relation to leases entered into by a subsidiary of the Group, which is not a party to  the deed of cross guarantee. It also provided a number of guarantees in respect of the Group companies as outlined  below.  Fortescue Ltd has unconditionally guaranteed the payment of principal and premium, if any, and interest related to the  senior unsecured and green senior unsecured notes as described in note 9(a)(i) with a total face value of US$3,600  million issued by FMG Resources (August 2006) Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary.  Fortescue Ltd and its wholly owned subsidiaries FMG Pilbara Pty Ltd, Chichester Metals Pty Ltd, FMG Solomon Pty  Ltd, International Bulk Ports Pty Ltd and The Pilbara Infrastructure Pty Ltd, have severally, fully and unconditionally  guaranteed the payment of the principal and premium, if any, and interest, including certain additional amounts that  may be payable in respect of the syndicated term loan as described in note 9(a)(ii) held by a wholly owned subsidiary,  FMG Resources (August 2006) Pty Ltd. The guaranteed syndicated term loan had a carrying amount of US$968  million as at 30 June 2024 (30 June 2023: US$975 million). The same parties have severally guaranteed the revolving  credit facility as described in note 9(a)(iii) of US$1,025 million (2023: US$1,025 million), which remained undrawn as at   30 June 2024.   ===== PAGE 194 ===== Financial report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    190 Notes to the consolidated financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2024 OTHER  21 Parent entity financial information (continued) (b) Guarantees entered into by the parent entity (continued) As part of its Aboriginal Business Development activities, Fortescue Ltd seeks opportunities for Aboriginal  businesses to provide replacement equipment or additional equipment as required. Fortescue Ltd is a guarantor of  the bank facilities used by the Aboriginal businesses to purchase these assets which are then leased to the Group. In addition, Fortescue Ltd has issued a number of bank and other guarantees to third parties for various operational  and legal purposes, which are in the normal course of business. It is not expected that these guarantees will be called  on. No liabilities were recognised by the parent entity or the Group in relation to these guarantees. (c) Contingent liabilities of the parent entity  The parent entity is a party to the legal proceedings disclosed and guarantees disclosed in note 15(i) but otherwise did  not have any contingent liabilities at 30 June 2024 or 30 June 2023.  ===== PAGE 195 ===== Financial report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    191 Overview Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability climate change  report Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Operating and   financial review Notes to the consolidated financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2024 OTHER  22 Interests in other entities (a) Subsidiaries  The consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets, liabilities and results of the following significant subsidiaries,  in accordance with the accounting policy described in note 23(a)(i): Equity holding  Country of Class 2024 2023 incorporation of shares % % Metals Segment Chichester Metals Pty Ltd Australia Ordinary 100 100 FMG International Pte Ltd Singapore Ordinary 100 100 FMG International Shipping Pte Ltd Singapore Ordinary 100 100 FMG Insurance Singapore Pte Ltd Singapore Ordinary 100 100 FMG Iron Bridge (Aust) Pty Ltd Australia Ordinary 100 100 FMG Magnetite Pty Ltd Australia Ordinary 100 100 FMG Pilbara Pty Ltd Australia Ordinary 100 100 The Pilbara Infrastructure Pty Ltd Australia Ordinary 100 100 Pilbara Marine Pty Ltd Australia Ordinary 100 100 Karribi Developments Pty Ltd  Australia Ordinary 100 100 FMG Air Pty Ltd Australia Ordinary 100 100 FMG Procurement Services Pty Ltd Australia Ordinary 100 100 Pilbara Housing Services Pty Ltd Australia Ordinary 100 100 FMG Autonomy Pty Ltd Australia Ordinary 100 100 Pilbara Iron Ore Pty Ltd Australia Ordinary 100 100 Pilbara Energy Company Pty Ltd Australia Ordinary 100 100 Pilbara Energy (Generation) Pty Ltd Australia Ordinary 100 100 FMG Clean Energy Pty Ltd Australia Ordinary 100 100 FMG Solomon Pty Ltd Australia Ordinary 100 100 FMG Resources (August 2006) Pty Ltd Australia Ordinary 100 100 FMG Trading Shanghai Co., Ltd China Ordinary 100 100 FMG Hong Kong Shipping Ltd  Hong Kong Ordinary 100 100 FMG Exploration Pty Ltd Australia Ordinary 100 100 FMG Resources Pty Ltd Australia Ordinary 100 100 FMG International Exploration Pte Ltd Singapore Ordinary 100 100 Argentina Fortescue S.A.U.

(a) Principles of consolidation (i) Subsidiaries The consolidated financial statements incorporate the  financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries,  being the entities controlled by the Company. Control  exists when the Group is exposed to, or has right to,  variable returns from its involvement with the entity and  has the ability to affect those returns through its power  to direct the activities of the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared  for the same reporting period as the Company, using  consistent accounting policies. All intercompany  balances and transactions, including unrealised profits  and losses arising from intra-group transactions, have  been eliminated in full. Subsidiaries are consolidated  from the effective date of acquisition to the effective date  of disposal. The acquisition method of accounting is used to account  for the Group’s business combinations. Identifiable  assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business  combination are, with limited exceptions, measured  initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.  Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred and  included in administration expenses. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair  value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded  as goodwill. If those amounts are less than the fair value  of the net identifiable assets of the business acquired,  the difference is recognised directly in profit or loss as a  bargain purchase. Where settlement of any part of consideration is deferred,  the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their  present value as at the date of exchange. The discount  rate used is the entity’s incremental borrowing rate, being  the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained  from an independent financier under comparable terms  and conditions. Contingent consideration is classified either as equity  or a financial liability. Amounts classified as a financial  liability are subsequently remeasured to fair value with  changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of  subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated  income statement, the consolidated statement of  comprehensive income, consolidated statement of  changes in equity and consolidated statement of  financial position, respectively. Notes to the consolidated financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2024 OTHER 22 Interests in other entities (continued) (c) Investments accounted for using the equity method The Group also holds interests in a number of individually immaterial joint ventures and associates that are accounted  for using the equity method.

Significant influence is the power to  participate in the financial and operating policy decisions  of the investee, but is not control or joint control over  those policies. Associates include entities where the  Group holds less than 20% of the voting rights, but has  determined that it has significant influence over those  entities due to the Group having representation on the  Board of directors and participation in decisions over the  relevant activities of those entities. Investments in associates are accounted for using the  equity method of accounting (see (iv) below), after  initially being recognised at cost.  (iii) Joint arrangements A joint arrangement is an arrangement when two or  more parties have joint control. Joint control exists when  the parties agree contractually to share control over  the activities that significantly affect the entity’s returns  (relevant activities), and the decisions about relevant  activities require the unanimous consent of the parties  sharing joint control. Joint arrangements are classified as either joint  operations or joint ventures, based on the contractual  rights and obligations between the parties to the  arrangement. Joint operations If the contractual arrangement specifies a right to the  assets and the obligations for the liabilities for the  parties, the arrangement is classified as joint operation.  The Group recognises its direct right to the assets,  liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and  its share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities,  revenue and expenses. These have been incorporated in the financial  statements under the appropriate headings. Details of  the joint operations are set out in note 22(b). If the contractual arrangement grants the parties the  right to the arrangement’s net assets, it is classified as a  joint venture. Interests in joint ventures are accounted for  using the equity method, after initially being recognised  at cost in the consolidated statement of financial  position. (iv) Equity method Under the equity method of accounting, the investments  are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter  to recognise the Group’s share of the post-acquisition  profits or losses of the investee in profit or loss, and the  Group’s share of movements in other comprehensive  income of the investee in other comprehensive income.  Dividends received or receivable from associates and  joint ventures are recognised as a reduction in the  carrying amount of the investment. Where the Group’s share of losses in an equity- accounted investment equals or exceeds its interest  in the entity, including any other unsecured long-term  receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses,  unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on  behalf of the other entity. Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and  its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the  extent of the Group’s interest in these entities. Unrealised  losses are also eliminated unless the transaction  provides evidence of an impairment of the asset  transferred. Accounting policies of equity-accounted  investees have been changed where necessary to ensure  consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. The carrying amount of equity-accounted investments  is tested for impairment in accordance with the policy  described in note 23(q).  ===== PAGE 199 ===== Financial report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    195 Overview Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability climate change  report Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Operating and   financial review Notes to the consolidated financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2024 OTHER  23 Summary of material accounting policies (continued) (b) Employee share trust The Group has formed a trust to administer its employee  share schemes. The trust is consolidated as the  substance of the relationship is that the trust is controlled  by the Group. Shares held by the share trust are disclosed  as treasury shares and deducted from contributed equity. (c) Foreign currency translation Transactions in foreign currencies have been converted  at rates of exchange at the date of those transactions.  Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign  currencies are translated at the rates of exchange of  the reporting date, with the resulting gains and losses  recognised in the income statement, except as set out  below: • For qualifying cash flow hedges, the gains and losses  arising on foreign currency translations are deferred in  other comprehensive income. • Translation differences on site rehabilitation provisions  are capitalised as part of the development assets.  • Gains and losses on assets and liabilities carried at fair  value are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. (d) Revenue recognition The Group is principally engaged in the business of  producing iron ore and providing related freight/shipping  services. Revenue is measured at the amount the Group  expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or  services and is recognised at the point at which control of  the goods or services is transferred to the customer. (i) Sale of products Revenue from the sale of products is recognised when  control has passed to the customer, no further work  or processing is required by the Group, the quantity  and quality of the products have been determined  with reasonable accuracy, the price can be reasonably  estimated and collectability is reasonably assured. The above conditions are generally satisfied when title  passes to the customer, typically on the bill of lading date  when iron ore is delivered to the vessel, or alternatively  on collection for port sales. Revenue is recorded at the invoiced amounts. However,  the shipping service represents a separate performance  obligation, and is recognised separately from the sale  of iron ore over the period during which the shipping  service has been provided, along with any associated  shipping costs. Fortescue’s iron ore sales contracts, which also include  shipping services, may provide for provisional pricing  of sales at the time the product is delivered to the  vessel with final pricing determined using the relevant  price indices on or after the vessel’s arrival at the port  of discharge. Under AASB 9, the receivable asset is  measured at fair value through profit and loss. (ii) Interest income Interest income is accrued using the effective interest  rate method.  ===== PAGE 200 ===== Financial report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    196 Notes to the consolidated financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2024 OTHER  23 Summary of material accounting policies (continued) (e) Deferred income Deferred income represents payments collected  but not earned at the end of the reporting period.  These payments are recognised as revenue when the  performance obligations are satisfied. Where deferred income is considered to contain a  financing component and if the period of time between  the receipt of the upfront cash and the satisfaction of the  future performance obligations is greater than 1 year, an  interest charge of the upfront amount will be recognised. (f) Income tax The income tax expense for the year is the tax payable  on the current year’s taxable income based on the  applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction. Income  tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current  and deferred tax. Current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of  the taxation laws enacted or substantively enacted at the  end of the reporting period in the countries where the  Company’s subsidiaries operate and generate taxable  income. Current income tax represents the expected  tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any  adjustments to tax payable in respect to previous years. Where the amount of tax payable or recoverable is  uncertain, a provision is established based on the  Group’s understanding of applicable tax law at the time.  Settlement of these matters may result in changes to  current and deferred income tax if the settlement differs  from the provision. Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability  method, on temporary differences arising between the  tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying  amounts (subject to the Pillar Two disclosure exception  noted below). However, the deferred income tax is not accounted for if  it arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability  in a transaction, other than a business combination,  that at the time of the transaction affects neither the  accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income  tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been  enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date  and are expected to apply when the related deferred  income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax  liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised for future deductible  temporary differences and carry forward of unused tax  losses only if it is probable that future taxable amounts  will be available to utilise those temporary differences  and losses. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each  reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is  no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be  realised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there  is a legal right to offset current tax assets and liabilities  and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same  taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities  are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right  to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to  realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The Group continues to monitor the implementation of  the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Pillar Two  initiative. These rules seek to ensure a 15% minimum  effective tax rate is paid by large multinational groups  in each global jurisdiction in which they operate. In this  regard, the Australian Government has announced an  intention to implement the Pillar Two rules in Australia,  retrospectively effective for income years commencing  on or after 1 January 2024. The implementing legislation,  if enacted, would apply to the Group from 1 July 2024.  This legislation was not enacted or substantively enacted  at 30 June 2024. Separately, as at 30 June 2024, BEPS Pillar Two  legislation has been enacted or substantively enacted  by several overseas jurisdictions in which the Group  operates. In each case, the earliest year the rules may  potentially apply to the Group is the first income year  commencing on or after 1 January 2024 (being 1 July  2024 in the case of the Group). Fortescue is within the  scope of Pillar Two, and is therefore expected to become  subject to the rules in certain jurisdictions from 1 July  2024.  ===== PAGE 201 ===== Financial report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    197 Overview Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability climate change  report Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Operating and   financial review Notes to the consolidated financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2024 OTHER  23 Summary of material accounting policies (continued) (f) Income tax (continued) As the rules did not yet apply to the Group in any country  at 30 June 2024, no current income tax has been  recognised as at 30 June 2024 in relation to Pillar Two  income taxes. Additionally, consistent with amendments  to AASB 112 Income Taxes, the Group has applied the  mandatory exception to recognising and disclosing  information about deferred tax assets and liabilities  relating to Pillar Two income taxes. Fortescue has undertaken an assessment of its potential  exposure to Pillar Two income taxes, based on the most  recent tax lodgements, country-by-country reporting  and financial statements for members of the Group. That  analysis indicates that if the rules had applied to the  entire Group in the 30 June 2024 year, no material Pillar  Two income tax would be payable by the Group. Fortescue and its wholly owned Australian controlled  entities have implemented the tax consolidation  legislation at 1 July 2002, namely the FMG tax  consolidated group, and are therefore taxed as a single  entity from that date. FMG Iron Bridge (Aust) Pty Ltd  and its wholly owned Australian controlled entities  have implemented the tax consolidation legislation as  at 28 September 2011, namely the FMG Iron Bridge tax  consolidated group, and are therefore taxed as a single  entity from that date. On 1 July 2022, the FMG Iron  Bridge tax consolidated group merged with the FMG tax  consolidated group, and are therefore taxed as a single  entity from this date.  The head entity and the controlled entities in the tax  consolidated group continue to account for their own  current and deferred tax amounts. These tax amounts  are measured as if each entity in the tax consolidated  group continues to be a standalone taxpayer in its own  right. In addition to its own current and deferred tax amounts,  the head entity of the group also recognises the current  tax liabilities, or assets, and the deferred tax assets it has  assumed from unused tax losses and unused tax credits  from controlled entities in the tax consolidated group. (g) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand,  short-term deposits and other short-term highly liquid  investments that are subject to an insignificant risk of  changes in value, and are readily convertible to known  amounts of cash. (h) Trade and other receivables Trade receivables other than iron ore sales receivables  and other receivables are recognised at amortised cost  using the effective interest method, less an allowance  for impairment. Trade receivables with embedded  derivatives for provisional pricing are measured at fair  value through profit and loss under AASB 9. The collectability of trade and other receivables is  reviewed on a monthly basis. Uncollectable amounts for  iron ore sales trade receivables are considered in the  measurement of fair value through the income statement  under AASB 9. Trade and other receivables that are  measured at amortised cost are determined using the  expected credit loss model. Total receivables which are  known to be uncollectable are written off by reducing the  carrying amount directly. Significant financial difficulties  of the customer, probability that the customer will enter  bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default or  delinquency in payments are considered indicators that  the receivable may not be collected. The amount of the  impairment allowance is the difference between the  receivable’s carrying amount and the present value of  estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original  effective interest rate. Cash flows relating to short-term  receivables are not discounted if the effect of discounting  is immaterial. The amount of the impairment allowance is recognised  in the income statement within administration expenses.  When a receivable for which an impairment allowance  had been recognised becomes uncollectable in a  subsequent period, it is written off against the allowance  account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously  written off are credited against other administration  expenses.  ===== PAGE 202 ===== Financial report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    198 Notes to the consolidated financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2024 OTHER  23 Summary of material accounting policies (continued) (h) Trade and other receivables (continued) (i) Accrued income Accrued income primarily relates to the Group’s rights  to consideration for work performed but not billed at  the reporting date. The accrued income is transferred  to trade receivables in accordance with contractual  terms with the customer, when the rights have become  unconditional.  Payments from customers are received based on a  billing schedule / milestone basis, as established in the  contract. (i) Inventories Warehouse stores and materials, work in progress  and finished goods are stated at the lower of cost and  net realisable value. Cost for raw materials and stores  is determined as the purchase price. Cost of work in  progress comprises direct materials, direct labour and  an appropriate proportion of variable and fixed overhead  expenditure, the latter being allocated on the basis of  normal operating capacity. For partly processed and saleable iron ore, cost is based  on the weighted average cost method and includes: • Materials and production costs, directly attributable to  the extraction, processing and transportation of iron ore  to the existing location. • Production and transportation overheads. • Depreciation of property, plant and equipment used in  the extraction, processing and transportation of iron  ore. Iron ore stockpiles represent iron ore that has been  extracted and is available for further processing or sale.  Quantities are assessed primarily through internal and  third party surveys. Where there is an indication that  inventories are obsolete or damaged, these inventories  are written down to net realisable value. Net realisable  value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course  of business less the estimated costs of completion and  the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Iron ore stockpiles classified as non-current assets  reflect stockpiles which are not expected to be utilised  within the next 12 months, with the net realisable value  calculated on a discounted cashflow basis. (j) Financial assets Fortescue classifies its financial assets into the following  categories: those to be measured subsequently at fair  value, being through either other comprehensive income  or through profit and loss, and those that are to be held  at amortised cost. The classification depends on the purpose for which  the financial assets were acquired. Management  determines the classification of its financial assets at  initial recognition. (i) Financial assets held at amortised cost The Group classifies its financial assets as held at  amortised cost only if the asset is held within a business  model with the objective to collect the contractual cash  flows, and the contractual terms give rise to cash flows  that are solely payments of principal and interest. The  classification of financial assets held at amortised cost  applies to Fortescue’s loans and receivables. These  debt instruments are initially measured at fair value  and subsequently carried at amortised cost. They  are included in current assets, except for those with  maturities greater than 12 months after the reporting  date which are classified as non-current assets. At the  end of each reporting period, loans and receivables are  reviewed for impairment.  ===== PAGE 203 ===== Financial report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    199 Overview Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability climate change  report Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Operating and   financial review Notes to the consolidated financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2024 OTHER  23 Summary of material accounting policies (continued) (j) Financial assets (continued) (ii) Financial assets held at fair value through other  comprehensive income (FVOCI) The Group’s classification of financial assets held at fair  value through other comprehensive income applies  to equity investments where the Group has made the  irrevocable election to present the fair value gains or  losses on revaluation of the asset in other comprehensive  income. This election can be made for each investment;  however, it is not applicable to equity investments which  are held for trading. These assets are included in non- current assets unless management intends to dispose  of the investment within 12 months of the reporting date.  These instruments are recognised at fair value, with  changes in fair value being recognised directly in other  comprehensive income. (iii) Financial assets held at fair value through profit or  loss (FVPL) This category comprises trade receivables including  the quotation period for the sale of iron ore, derivatives  (unless designated as effective hedging instruments) and  equity investments which are held for trading or where  the FVOCI election has not been applied. They are carried  on the consolidated statement of financial position at  fair value with changes in fair value or dividend income  recognised in profit or loss with any associated changes  in fair value recognised in the income statement. The  receivables relating to quotation period for the sale of  iron ore are recorded as trade receivables. (k) Financial liabilities (i) Trade payables Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair  value and subsequently carried at amortised cost and  represent liabilities for goods and services provided to  the Group prior to the end of the financial year that are  unpaid. (ii) Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of  the consideration received, less directly attributable  transaction costs. After initial recognition, borrowings  are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the  effective interest method. Borrowings are derecognised when the contractual  obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired, or when  the terms of an existing borrowing are substantially  modified. Any difference between the carrying amount  of a derecognised liability and the carrying amount of the  new liability is recognised in the income statement. (l) Property, plant and equipment (i) Recognition and measurement Each class of property, plant and equipment is stated at  historical cost less, where applicable, any accumulated  depreciation and impairment loss. Historical cost  includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the  acquisition of the assets. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of  materials and direct labour and any other costs directly  attributable to bringing an asset to a working condition  ready for its intended use. Assets under construction  are recognised in assets under development. Upon  commissioning, which is the date when the asset is in the  location and condition necessary for it to be capable of  operating in the manner intended by management, the  assets are transferred into property, plant and equipment  or development assets, as appropriate. Cost may also include transfers from equity of any  gain or loss on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign  currency purchases of property, plant and equipment.  Borrowing costs related to the acquisition or  construction of qualifying assets are capitalised. Costs  required for dismantling and rehabilitation are included  in rehabilitation estimates. Further information on  rehabilitation is in note 23(p).  ===== PAGE 204 ===== Financial report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    200 Notes to the consolidated financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2024 OTHER  23 Summary of material accounting policies (continued) (l) Property, plant and equipment (continued) (i) Recognition and measurement (continued) When separate parts of an item of property, plant and  equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted  for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.  Purchased software that is integral to the functionality  of the related equipment is capitalised as part of the  equipment. Gains and losses arising on disposal of property, plant  and equipment are recognised in the income statement  and determined by comparing proceeds from the sale of  the assets to their carrying amount. (ii) Subsequent costs Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s  carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset,  as appropriate, only when it is probable that future  economic benefits associated with these subsequent  costs will flow to Fortescue and the cost of the item can  be measured reliably. Ongoing repairs and maintenance  are recognised as an expense in the income statement  during the financial period in which they are incurred. (iii) Depreciation Depreciation of assets, other than land which is not  depreciated, is calculated using the straight-line method  or units of production method, net of residual values,  over estimated useful lives. Depreciation commences  on the date when an asset is available for use, that is,  when it is in the location and condition necessary for  it to be capable of operating in the manner intended  by management. Assets acquired under leases are  depreciated over the shorter of the individual asset’s  useful life and the lease term. Straight-line method Where the useful life is not linked to the quantities of iron  ore produced or when doing so results in depreciation  charges that do not reflect the asset’s useful life, assets  are generally depreciated on a straight-line basis. The  estimated useful lives for the principal categories of  property, plant and equipment depreciated on a straight- line basis are as follows: • Buildings 20 to 40 years • Rolling stock 25 to 30 years • Plant and equipment 2 to 20 years • Rail and port infrastructure assets 40 to 50 years. The estimated useful lives, residual values and  depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each  reporting period with the effect of any changes in  estimate accounted for on a prospective basis. Units of production method Where the useful life of an asset is directly linked to  the extraction of iron ore from a mine, the asset is  depreciated using the units of production method, unless  doing so results in depreciation charges that do not  reflect the asset’s useful life and the straight-line basis is  the more appropriate method. The units of production method is an amortised charge  proportional to the depletion of the estimated proven and  probable reserves at the mines.  ===== PAGE 205 ===== Financial report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    201 Overview Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability climate change  report Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Operating and   financial review Notes to the consolidated financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2024 OTHER  23 Summary of material accounting policies (continued) (l) Property, plant and equipment (continued) (iv) Exploration and evaluation expenditure Exploration and evaluation activities involve the search  for mineral resources, the determination of technical  feasibility and the assessment of commercial viability  of an identified resource. Exploration and evaluation  expenditure incurred is accumulated and capitalised in  respect of each identifiable area of interest, and carried  forward to the extent that: • Rights to tenure of the identifiable area of interest are  current. • At least one of the following conditions is also met: (i) The expenditure is expected to be recouped through  the successful development of the identifiable area of  interest, alternatively by its sale; or (ii) Where activities in the identifiable area of interest  have not, at the reporting date, reached a stage that  permits a reasonable assessment of the existence or  otherwise of economically recoverable reserves and  activities in, or in relation to, the area of interest, are  continuing. Exploration and evaluation assets are reviewed at  each reporting date for indicators of impairment and  tested for impairment where such indicators exist. If  the test indicates that the carrying value might not be  recoverable, the asset is written down to its recoverable  amount. These charges are recognised within  exploration, development and other expenses in the  income statement. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the  carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised  estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent  that the increased carrying amount does not exceed  the carrying amount that would have been determined  had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in  previous years. Once the technical feasibility and commercial viability of  the extraction of mineral resources in an area of interest  are demonstrable, exploration and evaluation assets  attributable to that area of interest are first tested for  impairment and then reclassified from exploration and  evaluation expenditure to development expenditure. (v) Development expenditure Development expenditure includes capitalised  exploration and evaluation costs, pre-production  development costs, development studies and other  expenditure pertaining to that area of interest. Costs  related to surface plant and equipment and any  associated land and buildings are accounted for as  property, plant and equipment. Development costs are accumulated in respect of  each separate area of interest. Costs associated with  commissioning new assets in the period before they  are capable of operating in the manner intended by  management are capitalised. Development costs  incurred after the commencement of production are  capitalised to the extent they are expected to give rise to  a future economic benefit. When an area of interest is abandoned or the Directors  decide that it is not commercially or technically feasible,  any accumulated cost in respect of that area is written  off in the financial period that the decision is made. Each  area of interest is reviewed at the end of each accounting  period and the accumulated costs written off to the  income statement to the extent that they will not be  recoverable in the future. Amortisation of development costs capitalised is  charged on a unit of production basis over the life of  estimated proven and probable reserves at the mines.  ===== PAGE 206 ===== Financial report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    202 Notes to the consolidated financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2024 OTHER  23 Summary of material accounting policies (continued) (m) Stripping costs (i) Development stripping costs Overburden and other mine waste materials are often  removed during the initial development of a mine in  order to access the mineral deposit. This activity is  referred to as development stripping and the directly  attributable costs, inclusive of an allocation of relevant  overhead expenditure, are capitalised as development  costs. Capitalisation of development stripping costs ceases  and amortisation of those capitalised costs commences  upon commercial extraction of ore. Amortisation of capitalised development stripping costs  is determined on a unit of production basis for each area  of interest.  Development stripping costs are considered in  combination with other assets of an operation for the  purpose of undertaking impairment assessments. (ii) Production stripping costs Overburden and other mine waste materials continue  to be removed throughout the production phase of the  mine. This activity is referred to as production stripping,  and the associated costs charged to the income  statement, as operating cost, except when all three  criteria below are met: • Production stripping activity provides improved  access to the specific component of the ore body, and  it is probable that economic benefit arising from the  improved access will be realised in future periods. • The Group can identify the component of the ore body  for which access has been improved. • The costs relating to the production stripping activity  associated with that component can be measured  reliably. If all of the above criteria are met, production stripping  costs resulting in improved access to the identified  component of the ore body are capitalised as part of  development asset and are amortised over the life of the  component of the ore body. The determination of components of the ore body  is individual for each mine. The allocation of costs  between production stripping activity and the costs of  ore produced is performed using relevant production  measures, typically strip ratios. Changes to the mine design, technical and economic  parameters affecting life of the components and strip  ratios are accounted for prospectively. (n) Intangible assets The Group capitalises amounts paid for the acquisition of  identifiable intangible assets, such as software, licenses,  trademarks and patents, where it is considered they will  contribute to future periods through revenue generation  or reductions in cost. The cost of intangible assets  acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair  value at the acquisition date. Following initial recognition,  intangible assets are carried at cost less amortisation  and any impairment losses. Intangible assets with  finite lives are amortised on a straight-line basis over  their useful lives and tested for impairment whenever  there is an indication that they may be impaired. The  amortisation period and method is reviewed at each  financial year end.  The estimated useful lives for the principal categories of  intangible assets amortised on a straight-line basis are as  follows: • Computer software 3 years • Patents and licenses 5 to 20 years  ===== PAGE 207 ===== Financial report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    203 Overview Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability climate change  report Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Operating and   financial review Notes to the consolidated financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2024 OTHER  23 Summary of material accounting policies (continued) (n) Intangible assets (continued) (i) Research and development costs Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development  expenditures on an individual project are recognised  as an intangible asset only when the Group can  demonstrate all of the following: • The technical feasibility of completing the intangible  asset so that the asset will be available for use or sale. • Its intention to complete and its ability and intention to  use or sell the asset. • How the asset will generate future economic benefits. • The availability of resources to complete the asset. • The ability to measure reliably the expenditure during  development. Following initial recognition of the development  expenditure as an asset, the asset is carried at cost  less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated  impairment losses. Amortisation of the asset begins  when development is complete and the asset is available  for use. It is amortised over the period of expected  future benefit. Amortisation is recorded in cost of sales.  During the period of development, the asset is tested for  impairment annually. (ii) Goodwill Goodwill is measured as described in note 23(a)(i).  Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is included in  intangible assets. Goodwill is not amortised but it is  tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if  events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might  be impaired, and is carried at cost less accumulated  impairment losses.  Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs)  for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation  is made to those CGUs or groups of CGUs that are  expected to benefit from the business combination in  which the goodwill arose.  (o) Leases The Group enters into contractual arrangements for the  leases of mining equipment, vehicles, buildings and other  assets. The nature of these arrangements can be lease  contracts or service contracts with embedded assets.  Typically, the duration of these contracts is for periods  of between two and five years, some of which include  extension options. Leases are recognised on the statement of financial  position as a right of use asset, representing the lessee’s  entitlement to the benefits of the identified asset over the  lease term, and a lease liability representing the lessee’s  obligation to make the lease payments. Each lease  payment is allocated between its liability and finance  cost component. The finance cost is charged to the  income statement over the lease period so as to produce  a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining  balance of the liability for each period.  The right of use asset is depreciated on a straight-line  basis over the shorter of the useful life of the asset  and lease term. When the right of use asset is used in  the extraction, processing and transportation of ore,  depreciation is included in inventory. Liabilities arising from contractual arrangements which  contain leases are initially measured at the present value  of the future lease payments. These payments include  the present value of fixed payments prescribed in the  contract; variable lease payments based on an index or  prescribed rate; amounts expected to be payable by the  lessor under residual value guarantees; and exercise  price of a purchase option if it is reasonably certain that  the option will be exercised. Right of use assets are initially measured at the amount  of the initial lease liability plus any lease payments at or  before commencement date less incentives received,  plus any initial direct costs, and any costs required for  dismantling and rehabilitation. Right of use assets are  subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated  depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, and  any adjustment for remeasurement of the lease liability.  Lease liabilities are subsequently measured at present  value, adjusted for any variations to the underlying  contract terms.  ===== PAGE 208 ===== Financial report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    204 Notes to the consolidated financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2024 OTHER  23 Summary of material accounting policies (continued) (o) Leases (continued) Lease payments are discounted using the interest rate  implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be determined,  the Group’s incremental borrowing rate is used, which is  the rate which the Group would have to pay to borrow the  funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value in  a similar economic environment over a similar term and  security. Payments for short-term leases and low value assets are  recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in the  income statement. Short-term leases are for a period  of 12 months or less and contracts involving low value  assets typically comprise small items of IT hardware and  minor sundry assets. (p) Rehabilitation provision Provisions are recognised when Fortescue has a present  legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events.  It is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will  be required to settle the obligation and the amount can  be reliably estimated. The mining, extraction and processing activities of  Fortescue give rise to obligations for site rehabilitation.  Rehabilitation obligations include decommissioning of  facilities, removal or treatment of waste materials, land  rehabilitation and site restoration. The extent of work required and the associated costs  are estimated using current restoration standards and  techniques. Provisions for the cost of each rehabilitation  program are recognised at the time that environmental  disturbance occurs. Rehabilitation provisions are initially  measured at the expected value of future cash flows  required to rehabilitate the relevant site, discounted  to their present value using Australian Government  bond market yields that match, as closely as possible,  the timing of the estimated future cash outflows. The  judgements and estimates applied for the estimation of  the rehabilitation provisions are discussed in note 24. When provisions for closure and rehabilitation are  initially recognised, the corresponding cost is capitalised  into the cost of mine development assets, representing  part of the cost of acquiring the future economic  benefits of the operation. The capitalised cost of  closure and rehabilitation activities is recognised within  development assets and is amortised based on the units  of production method over the life of the mine. The value  of the provision is progressively increased over time as  the effect of discounting unwinds, creating an expense  recognised in finance costs. At each reporting, date the rehabilitation liability is  remeasured to account for any new disturbance, updated  cost estimates, inflation, changes to the estimated  reserves and lives of operations, new regulatory  requirements, environmental policies and revised  discount rates. Changes to the rehabilitation liability are  added to or deducted from the related rehabilitation  asset and amortised accordingly. (q) Impairment of non-financial assets Assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events  or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying  amount may not be recoverable. The Group conducts an  internal review of asset values bi-annually, which is used  as a source of information to assess for any indications  of impairment. External factors, such as changes  in expected future prices, costs and other market  factors are also monitored to assess for indications of  impairment. If any such indication exists, an estimate of  the asset’s recoverable amount is calculated, being the  higher of fair value less direct costs to sell and the asset’s  value in use. An impairment loss is recognised for the  amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its  recoverable amount. Fair value is determined as the amount that would be  obtained from the sale of the asset in an arm’s length  transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties.  Fair value for mineral assets is generally determined  using independent market assumptions to calculate  the present value of the estimated future cash flows  expected to arise from the continued use of the asset,  including any expansion prospects, and its eventual  disposal. These cash flows are discounted using an  appropriate discount rate to arrive at a net present value  of the asset.  ===== PAGE 209 ===== Financial report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    205 Overview Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability climate change  report Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Operating and   financial review Notes to the consolidated financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2024 OTHER  23 Summary of material accounting policies (continued) (q) Impairment of non-financial assets (continued) Value in use is determined as the present value of the  estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the  continued use of the asset in its present form and its  eventual disposal, discounted using a pre-tax discount  rate that reflects current market assessments of the time  value of money and the risks specific to the asset for  which the estimates of future cash flows have not been  adjusted. Value in use is determined by applying assumptions  specific to the Group’s continued use and does not take  into account future development. In testing for indications of impairment and performing  impairment calculations, assets are considered as  collective groups and referred to as CGUs. CGUs are the  smallest identifiable groups of assets and liabilities that  generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the  cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Impaired assets are reviewed at each reporting date  whether there is any indication that an impairment  recognised in prior periods may no longer exist or  may have decreased. If any such indication exists,  the recoverable amount of that asset is estimated  and may result in a reversal of impairment loss. The  carrying amount of this asset is increased to its revised  recoverable amount, provided that this amount does  not exceed the carrying amount that would have been  determined had no impairment loss been recognised for  the asset in prior years. A reversal of impairment loss for  an asset is recognised in profit or loss. (r) Finance costs Finance costs principally represent interest expense and  are recognised as incurred except when associated with  major projects involving substantial development and  construction periods. In addition, finance costs include  losses arising on derecognition of finance liabilities at  above their carrying value, unwinding of the discount on  provisions and bank charges. Interest expense and other borrowing costs directly  attributable to major projects are added to the cost  of the project assets until such time as the assets are  substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Where  funds are used to finance an asset form part of general  borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using a  weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general  borrowings during the construction period. Investment income earned on the temporary investment  of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on  qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs  eligible for capitalisation. (s) Employee benefits (i) Wages and salaries and annual leave Liabilities for wages and salaries recognised in trade  and other payables, and non-monetary benefits and  annual leave recognised in provisions that are expected  to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date, are  classified as current liabilities in respect of employee  services up to the reporting date. They are measured at  the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are  settled. (ii) Long service leave The liability for long service leave is recognised in  provisions and measured as the present value of  expected future payments to be made in respect of  services provided by employees up to the reporting  date. Consideration is given to expected future wage and  salary levels, probability of employee departures and  periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using market  yields at the reporting date on Australian Government  bonds with terms to maturity and currency that match,  as closely as possible, the estimated future cash  outflows. The liability for long service leave for which  settlement within 12 months of the reporting date cannot  be deferred is recognised in the current provision. The  liability for long service leave for which settlement can  be deferred beyond 12 months from the reporting date is  recognised in the non-current provision.  ===== PAGE 210 ===== Financial report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    206 Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2024 OTHER  23 Summary of material accounting policies (continued) (t) Share-based payments Share-based remuneration benefits are provided to  employees under Fortescue’s share rights plan, as set out  in note 18. The fair value of rights is measured at grant date  and is recognised as an employee benefits expense  over the period during which the employees  become unconditionally entitled to the rights, with a  corresponding increase in equity. The fair value at grant date is determined using an  option pricing model that takes into account the exercise  price, the term of the right, the impact of dilution, the  share price at grant date and expected price volatility  of the underlying share, the effect of additional market  conditions, the expected dividend yield and the risk free  interest rate for the term of the right.  The fair value of the rights granted is measured to reflect  expected market vesting conditions, but excludes  the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for  example, profitability). Non-market vesting conditions are  included in assumptions about the number of rights that  are expected to become exercisable. At each reporting  date, the entity revises its estimate of the number of  rights that are expected to become exercisable. The  employee benefit expense recognised each period takes  into account the most recent estimate. The impact of the  revision to original estimates, if any, is recognised in the  income statement with a corresponding adjustment to  equity. (u) Dividends Provision is made for the amount of any dividend  declared, being appropriately authorised and no longer  at the discretion of the Company, on or before the end of  the reporting period but not distributed at the end of the  reporting period. (v) Earnings per share (i) Basic earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net  profit after tax attributable to the ordinary shareholders  by the weighted average number of ordinary shares on  issue during the financial year. (ii) Diluted earnings per share Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net  profit after tax attributable to the ordinary shareholders  by the weighted average number of ordinary shares on  issue during the financial year, after adjusting for the  effects of all potential dilutive ordinary shares that were  outstanding during the financial year. (w) Goods and Services Tax (GST) and other taxes on  consumption Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the  amount of associated consumptive tax, except where the  amount of consumptive tax incurred is not recoverable  from the taxation authority. In these circumstances  the consumptive tax is recognised as part of the cost  of acquisition of the asset or as part of an item of the  expense. Receivables and payables in the statement of  financial position are shown inclusive of consumptive tax.  The net amount of consumptive tax recoverable from, or  payable to, the taxation authority is included as a current  asset or liability in the statement of financial position. Cash flows are presented in the cash flow statement on a  gross basis, except for the consumptive tax component  of investing and financing activities, which is disclosed as  an operating cash flow. (x) Derivative financial instruments From time to time, the Group holds derivative financial  instruments to hedge its foreign currency and  commodity price risk exposures. Derivatives are initially  measured at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition,  derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes  therein are generally recognised in profit or loss.  ===== PAGE 211 ===== Financial report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    207 Overview Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability climate change  report Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Operating and   financial review Notes to the consolidated financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2024 OTHER  23 Summary of material accounting policies (continued) (y) Government grants Grants from the government are recognised at their fair  value where there is a reasonable assurance that the  grant will be received and the Group will comply with  all attached conditions. Government grants relating to  costs are deferred and recognised in profit or loss as  other income over the period necessary to match them  with the costs that they are intended to compensate.  Government grants relating to the purchase of property,  plant and equipment are included in non-current  liabilities as deferred income and they are credited to  profit or loss as other income on a straight-line basis  over the expected lives of the related assets.   (z) Comparatives Where applicable, certain comparatives have been  adjusted to conform with current year presentation. (aa) New accounting standards and interpretations (i) New and amended standards adopted by the Group The following new standards and amendments to  standards are mandatory for the first time for the  financial year beginning 1 July 2023 and have been  adopted by the Group. The amendments listed below did  not have any impact on the amounts recognised in prior  periods and are not expected to significantly affect the  current or future periods.   • AASB 2021-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting  Standards – Disclosure of Accounting Policies and  Definition of Accounting Estimates [AASB 7, AASB 101,  AASB 108, AASB 134 & AASB Practice Statement 2]   • AASB 2021-5 Amendments to Australian Accounting  Standards – Deferred Tax related to Assets and  Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction [AASB 112] • AASB 2023-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting  Standards – International Tax Reform –Pillar Two Model  Rules  [AASB 112]   (ii) New accounting standards and interpretations not yet  adopted Certain new accounting standards and interpretations  have been published that are not mandatory for the  30 June 2024 reporting period. These standards and  interpretations have not been early adopted by the  Group. These amendments are not expected to have  a material impact on the entity in the current or future  reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions.   ===== PAGE 212 ===== Financial report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    208 Notes to the consolidated financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2024 OTHER  24  Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of the consolidated financial statements  requires management to make judgements and  estimates and form assumptions that affect how  certain assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and equity  are reported. At each reporting period, management  evaluates its judgements and estimates based on  historical experience and on other factors it believes  to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results  of which form the basis of the carrying values of assets  and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other  sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates  under different assumptions and conditions. Fortescue has identified the following critical accounting  policies where significant judgements and estimates  are made by management in the preparation of these  financial statements. (a) Iron ore reserve estimates Iron ore reserves are estimates of the amount of product  that can be economically and legally extracted from  Fortescue’s current mining tenements. In order to  calculate ore reserves, estimates and assumptions  are required about a range of geological, technical  and economic factors, including quantities, grades,  production techniques, recovery rates, production costs,  transport costs, commodity demand, commodity prices  and exchange rates. Estimating the quantity and grade  of ore reserves requires the size, shape and depth of ore  bodies or fields to be determined by analysing geological  data such as drilling samples. This requires complex  and difficult geological judgements and calculations to  interpret the data. As economic assumptions used to estimate reserves  change and as additional geological data is generated  during the course of operations, estimates of reserves  may vary from period to period. Changes in reported  reserves may affect Fortescue’s financial results and  financial position in a number of ways, including the  following: • Asset carrying values may be affected due to changes  in estimated future cash flows. • Depreciation and amortisation charges in the income  statement may change where such charges are  determined by the units of production method, or  where the useful economic lives of assets change. • The carrying value of deferred tax assets may change  due to changes in estimates of the likely recovery of tax  benefits. (b) Exploration and evaluation expenditure -  recoverable amount Fortescue’s accounting policy for exploration and  evaluation expenditure results in expenditure being  capitalised for an area of interest where it is considered  likely to be recoverable by future exploitation or sale  or where the activities have not reached a stage which  permits a reasonable assessment of the existence of  reserves. This policy requires management to make  certain estimates as to future events and circumstances,  in particular whether an economically viable extraction  operation can be established. Any such estimates and  assumptions may change as new information becomes  available. If, after having capitalised the expenditure  under the policy, a judgement is made that recovery  of the expenditure is unlikely, the relevant capitalised  amount will be written off to the income statement. (c) Development expenditure - recoverable amount Development activities commence after commercial  viability and technical feasibility of the project is  established. Judgement is applied by management  in determining when a project is commercially viable  and technically feasible. In exercising this judgement,  management is required to make certain estimates  and assumptions as to future events. If, after having  commenced the development activity, a judgement is  made that a development asset is impaired, the relevant  capitalised amount will be written off to the income  statement.  ===== PAGE 213 ===== Financial report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    209 Overview Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability climate change  report Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Operating and   financial review Notes to the consolidated financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2024 OTHER  24  Critical accounting estimates and judgements (continued) (e) Rehabilitation estimates Fortescue’s accounting policy for the recognition of  rehabilitation provisions requires significant estimates  including the magnitude of possible works required  for the removal of infrastructure and of rehabilitation  works, future cost of performing the work, the inflation  and discount rates and the timing of cash flows. These  uncertainties may result in future actual expenditure  differing from the amounts currently provided. (f) Revenue (i) Revenue from iron ore sales The transaction price at the date control passes for sales  made subject to the provisional pricing mechanism  is estimated with reference to quoted index prices.  For sales where the final settlement price is yet to be  determined, the value of this revenue is adjusted by  considering tonnes subject to price finalisation at the  end of the period and applying the closing spot rate. (ii) Revenue from engineering services Revenue from engineering services is recognised over  time, as the services are provided to the customer,  based on costs incurred for work performed to date as a  percentage of total estimated costs under the contract  or amounts billed as a percentage of the contract value.  Judgements made that could have a significant effect  on the financial report and estimates with a risk of  adjustment in the next year are as follows:  • Determination of stage of completion  • Estimation of total contract revenue and contract costs  • Estimation of project completion date. (d) Property, plant and equipment – recoverable  amount The determination of FVLCD and value in use requires  management to make estimates about expected  production and sales volumes, commodity prices,  reserves (see ‘iron ore reserve estimates’ above),  operating costs, rehabilitation costs and future capital  expenditure. Management also considers the impact  of material climate-related risks, both transitional and  physical, on estimates of future costs and useful lives  of assets. Changes in circumstances may alter these  projections, which may impact the recoverable amount  of the assets. In such circumstances, some or all of the  carrying value of the assets may be impaired and the  impairment would be charged to the income statement. (i) Iron Bridge CGU - recoverable amount The Group has used the FVLCD approach to assess the  recoverable amount of the Iron Bridge CGU when the  Group has completed an impairment assessment. The  FVLCD is based on discounted cashflows using market- based exchange rates, commodity prices, expected  pricing premiums, estimated quantities of recoverable  resources, production levels, operating costs and capital  requirements and the cost of its eventual disposal, based  on CGU budgets and latest Life of Mine (LoM) plans.  Where appropriate, the fair value has included probability  weighted scenarios in calculating inputs. These cash  flows were discounted using a nominal post-tax discount  rate that reflected current market assessments of the  time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU. Production outputs, recoverability of resources and  operating and capital costs are based on both LoM plans  and internal budgets. Mine closure and rehabilitation  is based on a combination of internal estimates on  disturbance (based on LoM) and independent experts  estimates on fixed infrastructure decommissioning.   ===== PAGE 214 ===== Financial report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    210 Notes to the consolidated financial statements  For the year ended 30 June 2024 OTHER  24  Critical accounting estimates and judgements (continued) (g) Joint arrangements Judgement is required to determine when the Group  has joint control, which requires an assessment of the  relevant activities and when the decisions in relation  to those activities require unanimous consent. The  Group has determined that the relevant activities for its  joint arrangements relate to the operating and capital  decisions of the arrangement, such as the approval  of the capital expenditure program for each year. The  considerations made in determining joint control are  similar to those necessary to determine control over  subsidiaries (refer to note 23(a)).  Judgement is also required to classify a joint  arrangement as either a joint operation or joint venture.  Classifying the arrangement requires the Group to assess  its rights and obligations arising from the arrangement.  Specifically, it considers: •  The structure of the joint arrangement – whether it is  structured through a separate vehicle •  When the arrangement is structured through a  separate vehicle, the Group also considers the rights  and obligations arising from: –	the legal form of the separate vehicle –	the terms of the contractual arrangement  –	other facts and circumstances (when relevant). This assessment often requires significant judgement,  and a different conclusion on joint control, and also  whether the arrangement is a joint operation or joint  venture, may materially impact the accounting. (h) Fair value measurement of financial assets When the fair values of financial assets recorded in the  statement of financial position cannot be measured  based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value  is measured using valuation techniques including the  discounted cash flow model. The inputs to these models  are taken from observable markets where possible,  but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is  required in establishing fair values. Judgements include  considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk  and volatility. Changes in assumptions relating to these  factors could affect the reported fair value of financial  instruments.  ===== PAGE 215 ===== Financial report FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    211 Overview Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability climate change  report Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Operating and   financial review CONSOLIDATED ENTITY DISCLOSURE STATEMENT  At 30 June 2024 Name of entity Type of entity Trustee,  partner or  participant  in JV?i Place of  incorporation  or formationii % of issued  capital heldiii Australian  resident?iv Place of foreign  residence   (if applicable)v 1 ACRI Industry Solutions Pty Ltd Body corporate No Australia 100% Yes 2 Argentina Fortescue Future  Industries S.A.

Independent auditor’s report  To the members of Fortescue Ltd  Report on the audit of the financial report  Our opinion  In our opinion:  The accompanying financial report of Fortescue Ltd (the Company) and its controlled entities (together  the Group) is in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, including:  (a)  giving a true and fair view of the Group's financial position as at 30 June 2024 and of its  financial performance for the year then ended   (b)  complying with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001.  What we have audited  The financial report comprises:  •  the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2024   •  the consolidated income statement for the year then ended  •  the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended  •  the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended  •  the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended  •  the notes to the consolidated financial statements, including material accounting policy  information and other explanatory information   •  the consolidated entity disclosure statement as at 30 June 2024  •  the directors’ declaration.  Basis for opinion  We conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under  those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial  report section of our report.  We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis  for our opinion.  Independence  We are independent of the Group in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the  Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional & Ethical  Standards Board’s APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence  Standards) (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia. We have also  fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.   ===== PAGE 224 ===== FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    220     Our audit approach  An audit is designed to provide reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from  material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if  individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of  users taken on the basis of the financial report.  We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an  opinion on the financial report as a whole, taking into account the geographic and management  structure of the Group, its accounting processes and controls and the industry in which it operates.  Audit Scope  Our audit focused on where the Group made subjective judgements; for example, significant  accounting estimates involving assumptions and inherently uncertain future events.  The primary activity of the Group is the operation of integrated iron ore mining operations and  infrastructure comprising various iron ore mines in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, a rail  network and port facilities in Port Hedland. Additionally, the Group is developing and acquiring green  energy technologies and projects through the activities of the Fortescue Energy operating segment.  Our audit procedures were predominantly performed in Perth, where many of the Corporate and  Group Operations functions are centralised. This was supported by visits to Fortescue’s mining and  energy operations.  Key audit matters  Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in  our audit of the financial report for the current period. The key audit matters were addressed in the  context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do  not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Further, any commentary on the outcomes of a  particular audit procedure is made in that context. We communicated the key audit matters to the  Audit, Finance and Risk Management Committee.  Key audit matter  How our audit addressed the key audit matter  Operating sales revenue – iron ore and  shipping revenue  (Refer to note 3 and 24(f))  The Group recognised iron ore revenue of  US$16,405 million and shipping revenue of  US$1,613 million for the year ended 30 June  2024.  Fortescue’s sales contracts may be provisionally  priced at the initial revenue recognition (bill of  lading) date, with the final settlement price based  on a pre-determined quotation period. Operating  sales revenue from these contracts each  We performed the following audit procedures,  amongst others, over iron ore and shipping  revenue:  •  We performed tests on a sample basis of IT  systems and key controls involved in the  calculation of iron ore and shipping revenue,  including provisional pricing adjustments to  revenue.  •  We performed analytical procedures over  iron ore and shipping revenue, including  provisional pricing adjustments. We  compared revenue recognised with relevant  external price indices and external data over   ===== PAGE 225 ===== Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    221 Operating and   financial review Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability climate change  report Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Overview Financial report     Key audit matter  How our audit addressed the key audit matter  comprise two parts:  (1) Iron ore revenue and shipping revenue  recognised at the bill of lading date at current  prices; and  (2) Provisional pricing adjustments which  represent any difference between the  revenue recognised at the bill of lading date  and the final settlement price.  This is a key audit matter given the significance of  iron ore and shipping revenue to the consolidated  income statement.   Fortescue’s shipped tonnes.  •  For a sample of sales contracts open at  balance date, we inspected the sales  contracts and assessed key terms of the  sale including the volume of sales and  duration of any quotation period.  •  Compared journal entries to supporting  documentation for a selection based on risk,  including those posted at period-end which  impact iron ore and shipping revenue.  For a sample of sales contracts with provisional  pricing adjustments recorded during the year, we  confirmed that the provisional pricing adjustments  were appropriately presented within the financial  statements by reconciling the separately recorded  amounts to invoices.  Restoration and rehabilitation obligations  (Refer to note 13 and 24(e))  The Group recognised provisions for restoration  and rehabilitation obligations of US$1,028 million  as at 30 June 2024.   This is a key audit matter as the calculation of  these provisions requires judgement by the Group  in estimating the magnitude of possible works  required for the removal of infrastructure and  rehabilitation activities, the future cost of  performing the work, when rehabilitation activities  will take place, and the economic assumptions  such as inflation and discount rates applied to  future liabilities.   The judgement required by the Group to estimate  such costs is made in circumstances where there  has been limited restoration and rehabilitation  activity or historical precedent against which to  benchmark estimates of future costs. These  factors combine to make this area a key audit  matter.  To assess the Group’s restoration and  rehabilitation obligations, we performed the  following audit procedures, amongst others:   •  Developed an understanding of how the  Group identified the relevant methods,  assumptions, and sources of data, that are  appropriate for developing the closure plans  and associated cost estimates in the context  of the Australian Accounting Standards.  •  Developed an understanding of the relevant  control activities associated with developing  the closure plans and associated cost  estimates.  •  We checked the mathematical accuracy of  calculations underlying the rehabilitation  obligations on a sample basis, and whether  the timing of cash flows within the  calculations were consistent with latest life of  mine plans.  •  Assessed whether the discount rates used in  the rehabilitation calculations were  reasonable by comparing them to market  data.  •  Compared significant assumptions used in   ===== PAGE 226 ===== FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    222     Key audit matter  How our audit addressed the key audit matter  the closure plans and associated cost  estimates to other similar costs in the  business or external data where appropriate.  We assessed provision movements in the year  relating to restoration and rehabilitation  obligations to determine whether they were  consistent with our understanding of the Group’s  operations and associated rehabilitation plans.  Impairment indicator assessment for the Iron  Bridge Cash Generating unit (CGU)  (Refer to note12(a) and 24(d(i)))  In accordance with Australian Accounting  Standards and internal policies, the Group is  required to assess at each reporting date whether  there is any indication that its assets may be  impaired.   For the financial year ended 30 June 2024, the  Group’s assessment of the Iron Bridge CGU  identified no indicators of impairment and  concluded that an impairment test was not  required.  We consider the impairment indicator assessment  a key audit matter given the significance of Iron  Bridge CGU assets to the consolidated statement  of financial position and significant judgement is  required to assess whether there are any  indicators of impairment by reviewing iron ore  prices, exchange rates, discount rates and other  inputs.   To evaluate the Group’s impairment indicator  assessment of the Iron Bridge CGU we  performed the following procedures amongst  others :  •  Developed an understanding of the process  by which the Group conducted the  impairment indicator assessment and  whether it was appropriate under the  Australian Accounting Standards.  •  Assisted by PwC valuation experts in  aspects of our work, performed an  independent assessment of indicators of  impairment, by:  -  considering future iron ore prices,  exchange rates and other inputs, by  reviewing both internal information and  that published by external economic  and industry analysts and participants;  -  comparing the discount rate used by  the Group to market data and industry  research; and  -  evaluating the completeness of the  Group’s assessment of whether there  were any other external or internal  sources of information that could  indicate that the Iron Bridge CGU may  be impaired.  •  We have assessed the disclosures made in  the financial report against the requirements  of Australian Accounting Standards.       ===== PAGE 227 ===== Operating and   financial review Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability climate change  report Corporate   governance Corporate   directory Overview Financial report Overview Operating and   financial review Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources climate change  report Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Financial report Corporate   directory FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    223 Our approach   to sustainability Corporate   governance     Other information  The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the  information included in the annual report for the year ended 30 June 2024, but does not include the  financial report and our auditor’s report thereon.  Our opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and accordingly we do not  express any form of assurance conclusion thereon through our opinion on the financial report. We  have issued a separate opinion on the remuneration report and a limited assurance conclusion on the  Green Bond Allocation Reporting.  In connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information  and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial  report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.  If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of  this auditor’s report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are  required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.  Responsibilities of the directors for the financial report  The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report in accordance  with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001, including giving a true and fair  view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of  the financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  In preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group to  continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the  going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease  operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.  Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial report  Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is  free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that  includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that  an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material  misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material  if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic  decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial report.

The maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website is the responsibility of the Group’s management;  the work carried out by us does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, we accept  no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the reported Subject Matter Information or  Criteria when presented on the Group’s website.   Our assurance conclusion is with respect to the Subject Matter Information as at 30 June 2024, and  does not extend to any other information included in, or linked from, the Fortescue FY24 Annual  Report including any images, audio files or videos.   ===== PAGE 232 ===== FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    228 FORTESCUE  FY23 ANNUAL REPORT    |    228     Responsibilities of Management  The Group’s management is responsible for the Subject Matter and for the preparation of the Subject  Matter in accordance with the Criteria. This responsibility includes:  •  determining appropriate reporting topics and selecting or establishing suitable criteria for  measuring, evaluating and preparing the underlying Subject Matter Information;  •  ensuring that those criteria are relevant and appropriate to the Group and the intended users;  and  •  designing, implementing and maintaining systems, processes and internal controls over  information relevant to the evaluation or measurement of the Subject Matter Information,  which is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, against the Criteria.  Our Independence and quality management  We have complied with the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standard  Board's APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards)  relevant to assurance engagements, which are founded on fundamental principles of integrity,  objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.  Our firm applies Australian Standard on Quality Management ASQM 1, Quality Management for Firms  that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Reports and Other Financial Information, or Other  Assurance or Related Services Engagements, which requires the firm to design, implement and  operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with  ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.  Our responsibilities  Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion based on the procedures we have  performed and the evidence we have obtained.   Our engagement has been conducted in accordance with the Australian Standard on Assurance  Engagements (ASAE 3000) Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical  Financial Information. That standard requires that we plan and perform this engagement to obtain  limited assurance about whether anything has come to our attention to indicate that the Subject Matter  has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria as at 30 June 2024.   The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are  less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement and consequently the level of assurance  obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have  been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. Accordingly, we do not  express a reasonable assurance opinion.        ===== PAGE 233 ===== Operating and   financial review Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources Our approach   to sustainability climate change  report Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report  Financial report Corporate   governance Overview Financial report Corporate   directory FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    229 Overview Operating and   financial review Ore Reserves and   Mineral Resources climate change  report Our approach   to sustainability Corporate   governance Directors’ report    |  Remuneration  Report      In carrying out our limited assurance engagement we:  •  made inquiries of the persons responsible for the Subject Matter Information;  •  obtained an understanding of the process for collecting and reporting the Subject Matter  Information and obtaining supporting evidence to assess the eligibility of the project against  the Group’s Sustainability Financing Framework (as announced on 9 November 2021);  •  obtained supporting evidence to assess the appropriateness of selected estimates,  assumptions and methodologies applied by management in the allocation of green bonds  proceeds to eligible projects;  •  performed limited substantive testing on a selective basis of the Subject Matter Information to  assess that data had been appropriately measured, recorded, collated and reported; and  •  considered the disclosure and presentation of the Subject Matter Information.  We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our  conclusion.  Inherent limitations  Inherent limitations exist in all assurance engagements due to the selective testing of the information  being examined. It is therefore possible that fraud, error or non-compliance may occur and not be  detected. A limited assurance engagement is not designed to detect all instances of non-compliance  of the Subject Matter with the Criteria, as it is limited primarily to making enquiries, of the Group’s  management, and applying analytical procedures.   Additionally, non-financial data may be subject to more inherent limitations than financial data, given  both its nature and the methods used for determining, calculating and estimating such data. The  precision of different measurement techniques may also vary. The absence of a significant body of  established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial information allows for  different, but acceptable, evaluation and measurement techniques that can affect comparability  between entities and over time.  The limited assurance conclusion expressed in this report has been formed on the above basis.  Our limited assurance conclusion  Based on the procedures we have performed, as described under ‘Our responsibilities’ and the  evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the  Subject Matter Information has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the  Criteria as at 30 June 2024.  Emphasis of matter  The basis of preparation of the Pilbara Transmission Project was amended in FY24.     We draw attention to basis of preparation on page 41 which sets out the amendment to the calculation  methodology in FY24 and the resultant impact to the cumulative spend of the Pilbara Transmission  Project. Our conclusion is not modified in respect of this matter.   ===== PAGE 234 ===== FORTESCUE  FY24 ANNUAL REPORT    |    230     Use and distribution of our report  We were engaged by the board of directors of Fortescue Ltd to prepare this independent assurance  report having regard to the criteria specified by the Group and set out in this report.

Green ammonia,  in contrast, is 100 per cent renewable.  One way to make green ammonia is  via the Haber Bosch process. Green  hydrogen and nitrogen that has been  extracted from the air are reacted  together during a process powered by  renewable electricity to produce green  ammonia, or NH3.  Green hydrogen Green hydrogen is hydrogen produced  via electrolysis of water. Electrolysis  splits the water molecule into its  constituents, hydrogen and oxygen. The  process must be powered by renewable  electricity for the hydrogen to be defined  as green. Green iron Fortescue defines ‘green iron’ as the end  product resulting from processing iron  ore into iron, using renewable energy and  with near zero carbon emissions. Green iron ore Iron ore that has been mined without  the use of fossil fuels, i.e. using haul  trucks and other equipment that runs on  battery electric or green hydrogen based  technologies.  Green metals Fortescue defines ‘green metal’ as metal  ore mined and processed into metal  using renewable energy and with near  zero carbon emissions. This green metal  definition similarly applies to processing  iron ore into iron.

Geological evidence is derived from  adequately detailed and reliable  exploration, sampling and testing  gathered through appropriate  techniques from locations such as  outcrops, trenches, pits, workings  and drill holes, and is sufficient to  assume geological and grade (or  quality) continuity between points  of observation where data and  samples are gathered. An Indicated  Mineral Resource has a lower level  of confidence than that applying to a  Measured Mineral Resource and may  only be converted to a Probable Ore  Reserve.  Inferred Mineral Resource	 An ‘Inferred Mineral Resource’ is that  part of a Mineral Resource for which  quantity and grade (or quality) are  estimated on the basis of limited  geological evidence and sampling.  Geological evidence is sufficient  to imply but not verify geological  and grade (quality) continuity. It is  based on exploration, sampling and  testing information gathered through  appropriate techniques from locations  such as outcrops, trenches, pits,  workings and drill holes.  An Inferred Mineral Resource has a  lower level of confidence than that  applying to an Indicated Mineral  Resource and must not be converted  to an Ore Reserve. It is reasonably  expected that the majority of Inferred  Mineral Resources could be upgraded  to Indicated Mineral Resources with  continued exploration.

Measured Mineral Resource	 A ‘Measured Mineral Resource’ is that part  of a Mineral Resource for which quantity,  grade (or quality) densities, shape, and  physical characteristics are estimated  with confidence sufficient to allow the  application of Modifying Factors to  support detailed mine planning and final  evaluation of the economic viability of the  deposit. Geological evidence is derived  from adequately detailed and reliable  exploration, sampling and testing gathered  through appropriate techniques from  locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits,  workings and drill holes, and is sufficient to  confirm geological and grade (or quality)  continuity between points of observation  where data and samples are gathered.

The remainder of this report will outline how we plan to reduce our emissions Fortescue emits more than 2.5 million tonnes of carbon  dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) into the atmosphere every year.  Customers of our iron ore – primarily steel mills located in  Asia – emit a further 261.5 million tonnes of CO2-eq annually.  This report outlines our Board approved US$6.2 billion plan  to achieve Real Zero, which means the elimination of Scope  1 and 2 emissions by 2030 by eliminating the use of fossil  fuels from our Australian terrestrial iron ore operations. We  are dedicated to doing this without using voluntary carbon  offsets from FY24 onwards for Scope 1 and 2 emissions.  At the time of this report, Fortescue has identified the  solutions it plans to adopt to eliminate approximately 90%  of terrestrial Scope 1 and 2 emissions from its Australian iron  ore operations. We are actively working to identify solutions  for the final approximately 10%.  We also have separate targets to eliminate emissions from  our marine vessels by 2030 and achieve Net Zero Scope 3  emissions by 2040. We are presently developing our plans to  meet these targets. Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from sources owned  or controlled by an entity. Scope 2 refers to emissions  associated with the production of electricity, heat, or steam  purchased by an entity. Scope 3 refers to all other indirect  emissions associated with activities or facilities not owned or  controlled by the entity. 1,2 In general, when we refer to emissions, we refer to all  greenhouse emissions, reported in the unit of tonnes of   CO2-eq. This is defined as the amount of CO2 that would  cause the same temperature rise, over a given time period,  as an emitted amount of greenhouse gas or mixture of  greenhouse gases.³ Stepping beyond fossil fuels and voluntary carbon offsets  helps reduce our exposure to regulatory and supply chain  risk, while potentially generating significant operating cost  savings. In FY23, gas and diesel cost Fortescue over US$560 million,  while voluntary offsets cost US$6.2 million. Eliminating our emissions could also bring greater value to  our shareholders, enabling us to enter the growing market  for zero-emissions power systems, commercialise our green  technologies and enable access to sustainable finances. Scope 1 and 2 emissions  In FY23, total gross Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our  Australian iron ore operations and Fortescue marine vessels,  which consist of eight VLOCs and nine tugboats that operate  under Fortescue’s operational control in Port Hedland, were  2.55 million tonnes CO2-eq.  Our Scope 1 emissions consisted of 2.2 million tonnes of  CO2-eq in FY23, while our Scope 2 emissions from power  purchases were lower, at 0.35 million tonnes of CO2-eq.    Of our FY23 Scope 1 mining operations emissions: •	 35% came from other Heavy Mobile Equipment (HME) 	 	 (diesel) •	 25% originated from our mining haul trucks (diesel) •	 13% came from stationary power (gas, diesel) •	 12% originated from marine vessels under our exclusive 	 	 control (heavy marine fuel oil) •	 11% came from our rail operations (diesel) •	 4% came from other sources. 01 1 https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/ green driven capital markets.uploads/2018/02/ipcc_wg3_ar5_annex-i.pdf 2 Under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Accounting standards, we use the 'Operational Control' boundary method.  3 https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/glossary/#:~:text=CO2%20equivalent%20(CO2,or%20a%20mixture%20of%20GHGs.  ===== PAGE 14 ===== *This trajectory assumes the complete, successful and timely implementation of Fortescue’s current decarbonisation plan.

As part of our plan to achieve Real Zero terrestrial emissions  across our Australian iron ore operations by 2030, we forecast  that our Scope 1 and 2 emissions in the Pilbara will initially rise  out to FY26 before they begin to fall. This initial rise will occur  due to production at Iron Bridge scaling up to reach nameplate  capacity.  Emissions are forecast to fall from FY26 onwards as renewable power capacity substantially increases and we begin to  deploy a zero-emission mobile fleet across our Pilbara operations. At the time of this report, Fortescue has identified the solutions it plans to adopt to eliminate approximately 90% of  terrestrial Scope 1 and 2 emissions from its Australian iron ore operations. We are actively working to identify solutions for  the final approximately 10%. Fortescue’s use of renewable energy in the Pilbara continues to rise: •	 Since FY19, renewable energy use has risen from less than 1 gigawatt hour (GWh) to 145.7GWh in FY23 •	 Since FY22, renewable energy consumption has risen 58GWh  •	 Today, renewable energy comprises 20% of the electricity we purchase for our Pilbara iron ore operations In FY23 we also surrendered 336,833 tonnes in CO2-eq of offsets to meet our previous commitment to a 3% year-on-year  net reduction in our emissions. As stated earlier, in FY24 we will no longer purchase voluntary carbon offsets for Scope 1  and 2 emissions, instead focusing our efforts on actual emission elimination. We will replace our 3% target by committing  interim financial spend to deliver our decarbonisation pathway to Real Zero. *Our emissions are forecast to fall within the shaded range based on our current decarbonisation plan and modelling. It is subject to  various factors beyond our control, including those set out in this report and our FY23 Annual Report.  ===== PAGE 15 ===== Our targets Our strategy Managing risk Governance Industry and research partners Overview FORTESCUE  FY23 CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT    |    13 CO2-eq (million tonnes) Total Scope 3 emissions Employee commuting Chartered cargo ship Capital goods Fuel and energy refining and transport Business travel Purchased goods and services Crude steel manufacturing Scope 3  Our Scope 3 emissions in FY23 (267.61 million tonnes of  CO2-eq) were 5% higher than in FY22. This increase in Scope  3 emissions was caused primarily by a rise in the amount of  iron ore shipped, from 189 million tonnes in FY22 to   192 million tonnes in FY23.  Scope 3 emissions are those that fall within our value chain  but are outside our operational control, including those  generated during the shipping of our products in non- Fortescue vessels and iron and steel production.⁴ By far the largest source of Fortescue’s Scope 3 emissions  is the steelmaking process, which accounts for 98% of  our Scope 3 emissions or 261.5 million tonnes CO2-eq.  Steelmaking generates significant emissions due to its  current reliance on coking and thermal coal, however  new approaches that use renewable electricity and green  hydrogen to produce green steel are under development by  Fortescue and other businesses.  4  Our Scope 3 estimates are informed by the international GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. In  accordance with this guidance, estimates for quantified Scope 3 emissions that were determined to be material are provided in the data tables.  The next largest sources of Scope 3 emissions in FY23 were  chartered cargo shipping (2.78 million tonnes CO2-eq) and  purchased goods and services (2.5 million tonnes CO2-eq). Key drivers for the change in Scope 3 emissions between  FY23 and FY22 were: •	 Changes in estimation methodologies for purchased  goods and services, capital goods, and shipping (see  Section 13 for detail) •	 Greater production of iron ore •	 Changes in our product mix and destination markets Scope 3 emissions   excluding crude steel manufacturing 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Chartered cargo ship Purchased goods and services Capital goods Fuel and energy refining and transport Employee commuting Business travel  ===== PAGE 16 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT    |    14 Overview GHG EMISSIONS DATA FY23 FY22  FY21  FY20  Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (million tonnes CO₂-e) Total Gross Scope 1 and 2 emissions 2.55 2.55 2.56 2.43 Total Gross Scope 1 emissions 2.2 2.21 2.40 2.27      Gross Scope 1 shipping emissions 0.26 0.31 0.32 0.34      Gross Scope 1 emissions (excl shipping) 1.94 1.91 2.08 1.93 Gross Scope 2 emissions 0.35 0.33 0.16 0.16 Total Net Scope 1 and 2 emissions 2.21 2.28 2.36 2.43 Emission reduction through offsets 0.34 0.26  0.20  –  Emissions intensity in electricity generation    (CO₂/mt ore processed)  3.31 3.32  3.50  3.49  Energy consumed Diesel consumption (million litres) 633 634  700  641  Natural gas consumption (PJ) 4.1 3.4  3.6  3.6  Other (PJ) 0.4 0.6  0.5  0.4  Non-renewable electricity purchased (GWh) 567 494  260  260  Renewable electricity purchased (GWh) 145.7 87.7  0.7  0.4  Total net energy consumed (PJ) 31.5 30.6  32.0  29.7  Scope 3 emissions (million tonnes CO₂-e) Crude steel manufacturing  261.46 250.37  242.83  – Chartered cargo shipping  2.86** 3.16*  2.96* – Purchased good and services  2.50 2.07  1.84  – Capital goods  0.12 0.27  0.52  – Fuel and energy refining and transport  0.50 0.12  0.12  – Employee commuting  0.03 0.10  0.06  – Business travel  0.03 0.03  0.02  – Upstream leased assets 0.11 – – – Total gross Scope 3 emissions  267.61 256.14*  248.34*  A dash (-) indicates where data has not been reported in previous years. *Restated numbers, reasoning detailed in section Shipping Emissions Methodology Changes **FY23 value of 2.86mt includes less than 0.08mt of non-chartered cargo vessel upstream transportation and distribution emissions in addition to the  chartered cargo shipping emissions of 2.78mt GHG emissions data from FY20 – FY23  ===== PAGE 17 ===== Our targets Our strategy Managing risk Governance Industry and research partners Overview FORTESCUE  FY23 CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT    |    15 EXECUTIVE  CHAIRMAN’S   MESSAGE In recent months, we have witnessed extreme  events on every continent. The hottest global  daily temperatures on record, the worst wildfires  on record, the largest evacuation in Greece’s  history, the longest heatwaves, the lowest sea ice  levels in Antarctica, the warmest oceans Forty years ago, Professor  James Hansen at NASA  wrote that policy wouldn’t  change “until convincing  observations of the global  warming are in hand.” ANDREW FORREST July 2023 was the hottest month on record, over 1.5°C  warmer on average than in pre-industrial times.⁵ The climate is changing faster than we are. Until we flip that,  it means humanity and any business that thinks it’s too big  to fail is the loser. We literally cannot act fast enough. The  only answer is to step beyond fossil fuels, step beyond  offsets and go all in on green energy.  Fortescue knows it’s possible, because we are already right  on track to doing it. In FY23, our consumption of renewable energy increased  66% relative to FY22. Renewables already provide up to  100% of Christmas Creek’s and Cloudbreak’s daytime  stationary energy needs. Overall, our Chichester Solar Gas  Hybrid Project displaces over 100 million litres of diesel  every year. There is an initial cost to decarbonising, however, as this  report shows, it’s an investment – unlike the US$560 million  we spent on diesel and gas in FY23 or the US$6.2 million we  spent in FY23 on voluntary offsets.  Offsets are a fiction: as a result, you get a nice, linear decline  in your emissions that is both pleasing on the eye and  incredibly deceptive. As you will see in this report, we are  doing things differently.  We are actually eliminating fossil fuels – and from now on,  we are also eliminating voluntary carbon offsets. We will not  buy offsets unless legally required to do so. The science is  clear: planting trees is great for the environment, but it won’t  hold off the planetary scale meltdown we are experiencing.  We are developing zero-emission mining technologies,  powered by a vast new renewable grid in the Pilbara. We are  designing new processes that could help the steel industry  decarbonise. We are developing green hydrogen projects all  over the world. The only thing worse than global warming is global inaction.  When the world looks back on the 2020s – the last chance  humanity had to prevent warming of 1.5 to 2°C – we will be  able to say we did our best to protect our shareholders and  our children from the unacceptable risk posed by climate  change. I hope you are proud of your little Company – now leading  the world where it must now go. ⁵ https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-and-wmo-july-2023-track-be-hottest-month-record  ===== PAGE 18 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT    |    16 Overview ABOUT  FORTESCUE Since our founding twenty years ago, Fortescue has become  one of the world’s largest producers of iron ore – globally  recognised for its world leading approach to building  low-cost, large-scale infrastructure. We are the number 1  integrated green technology, energy and metals company. Since Fortescue’s first commercial shipment of 180,000  tonnes of iron ore departed from Port Hedland, Western  Australia to China in May 2008, Fortescue has remained  a major, integral supplier of iron ore to the Chinese steel  industry. Fortescue is now shipping at an annual rate of over  190 million tonnes with more than 1.9 billion tonnes of iron  ore delivered to its customers since 2008. Our iron ore operations include three hematite mining hubs  in the Pilbara and our Iron Bridge magnetite mine. Our three  hubs are connected by 760 kilometres of rail to Herb Elliott  Port and the Judith Street Harbour towage infrastructure in  Port Hedland. We have also just delivered first ore to ship  for our high grade magnetite project, Iron Bridge. Fortescue  operates eight purpose-built 260,000 tonne capacity ore  carriers.  Fortescue is unique within the heavy industry: we are  committed to reducing our emissions to Real Zero by  2030 across our Australian terrestrial mining operations –  eliminating fossil fuels by developing local renewable power  and replacing our existing equipment with battery electric  and green hydrogen models.  We also have a net zero Scope 3 emissions target by 2040.  Around 98 per cent of those emissions arise from crude  steel manufacturing. We are supporting the development  of technologies that will help enable our customers to  make green steel, without coal, from the full spectrum of  Fortescue’s iron ore products.  For our size and scale, there is no other mining company  in the world that is taking the action we are to eliminate  emissions.  The Fortescue group is a top 10 ASX listed company.  Fortescue has two divisions – Metals and Energy. They work  together for Fortescue as a whole, to ensure allocation of  resources is prioritised across the divisions. Our Metals  team focuses on our Australian and global iron ore deposits,  exploration into new fields and the development of green  iron technologies for future use. Fortescue Energy comprises Fortescue Future Industries  (FFI), Fortescue Hydrogen Systems and Fortescue WAE,  focuses on meeting urgent global demand for green energy,  aviation fuels, green fertilisers and green shipping fuels. In  2023, the energy business focused on bringing projects to  Final Investment Decision. Fortescue always strives to empower the communities we  operate in and deliver positive social and economic change  through training, employment and business development  opportunities. This is evident through initiatives such as our Billion  Opportunities program which has awarded more than   A$4.6 billion in contracts to First Nations businesses since it  was established in 2011.

FY23 achievements  ===== PAGE 21 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT    |    19 Our targets Our strategy Governance Industry and research partners Overview Managing risk OUR  TARGETS Scope 1 and 2 Emissions by 2030  Real Zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions across our  Australian iron ore operations by 2030, with a  commitment to have our targets verified in   FY24 by the Science Based Targets Initiative.  Real Zero refers to no fossil fuels and no offsets.  We have a costed plan to decarbonise our Australian  terrestrial iron ore operations in the Pilbara by 2030. At the  time of this report, Fortescue has identified the solutions it  plans to adopt to eliminate approximately 90% of terrestrial  Scope 1 and 2 emissions from its Australian iron ore  operations. We are actively working to identify solutions for  the final approximately 10%.  We are also finalising our plan for how to eliminate  Fortescue’s remaining Scope 1 and 2 emissions from across  our operations, including Fortescue Energy.  From FY24 onwards, Fortescue will no longer buy offsets  unless required by law, as offsets have been shown to  be troubled by extensive concerns about quality, lack of  additionality and an inability to deliver real reductions in  emissions. Through Fortescue Energy, we are also going to give the  world an alternative to fossil fuels.  Scope 3 Emissions by 2040 Work to provide technology solutions to  decarbonise the steelmaking process, shipping  and upstream emissions. Our approach to reducing our Scope 3 emissions – those  emissions generated by steel mills, shipping, upstream  construction and other aspects of our global supply chain  – is to develop innovative low emission iron reduction  technologies and processes inhouse and via partnerships  and to scale supply of green hydrogen and green solutions  from Fortescue Energy. We have set the following Scope 3 targets:  •	 By 2030, enable a reduction in emissions intensity from  steelmaking by Fortescue’s customers of 7.5%, from   FY21 levels •	 By 2030, enable a reduction in emissions intensity levels  from the shipping of our iron ore by 50%, from FY21 levels Fortescue is working hard to decarbonise its fleet of eight  ore carriers (Scope 1) via green ammonia and engaging with  the shipping industry to reduce, and eventually eliminate,  emissions from shipping (Scope 3). 02  ===== PAGE 22 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT    |    20 Our strategy OUR STRATEGY Fortescue recognises the urgent, global need for innovation at scale, both to  enable heavy industry to decarbonise and to drive large-scale generation of  green energy and green hydrogen Through inhouse scientific teams and with collaborations  and engagement with other companies and academic  institutions, we are developing and implementing  decarbonisation solutions that can help address our Scope 1,  2 and 3 emissions. Our climate change strategy focuses on: •	 Decarbonisation of our iron ore operations  •	 Decarbonisation of our value chains •	 Fortescue Energy  Decarbonisation of iron ore operations Our Pilbara operations As part of our strategy to decarbonise our Pilbara Scope 1  and 2 emissions, we are focusing on:  •	 Zero-emission mobility •	 Zero-emission shipping  •	 Green solutions supplied by Fortescue Energy 03 Zero-emissions haul truck   prototypes head to site Green Pioneer   ammonia shipping   launches at COP28 Small zero-emissions   truck trial Electric Vehicle trials at site  Zero-emissions excavators   energised on site Zero-emissions bus trials on site 2023 Our Pilbara decarbonisation roadmap  Scope 1 and 2 terrestrial iron ore emissions Please note:  This timeline is indicative only and assumes the complete, successful and timely implementation of Fortescue’s current decarbonisation plan.

In FY23, the team continued to design solution pathways  consisting of both “off-the-shelf” products and new  technologies via collaborations and partnerships with world- leading Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), including  Liebherr and Fortescue WAE.  The focus of this workstream also includes the design and  construction of the on-site electrical infrastructure required  to power and charge our new fleet.  The Green Mobility group is also identifying solutions to  diesel generators, light vehicles, support mining equipment  and working with on-site contracting partners to align on  a pathway to successfully transition their fleets. A suite of  trials for validating battery electric light vehicles, support  mining equipment and electrical infrastructure will be  completed in FY24. The team is pursuing opportunities with OEMs across the  complex supply chain and have committed to purchase  three electric 400 tonne excavators and two battery electric  locomotives.  Fortescue has started designing and constructing the   on-site electrical reticulation infrastructure that will take  the energy from the Pilbara Energy Connect transmission  to where it is needed on site. The project aims to integrate  Fortescue’s Pilbara iron ore mining and port operations into  one common 220kV network. This program of works will continue through FY24 to FY28 to  enable our sites to have the electrical infrastructure ready to  power the electrical equipment, as it becomes operational.  Other FY23 milestones: •	 In June, our first prototype battery electric haul truck,  Roadrunner, arrived at Christmas Creek. Roadrunner  brings several surface mining firsts, including the ability  to fast-charge in 30 minutes and capacity to store  regenerated power as it drives downhill •	 A prototype hydrogen fuel cell electric truck will be  delivered to Christmas Creek later in 2023 •	 A prototype Offboard Power Unit, which can power  the Liebherr Electric Excavator previously delivered to  site, and a 3MW prototype fast charger (to charge the  prototype battery electric haul truck) were transported to  Christmas Creek to continue commissioning and site- based testing •	 In May, a dual-fuelled prototype ammonia-powered  locomotive arrived at Solomon to undergo field tests.  Commissioning is underway in readiness for mainline  trials in FY24 •	 We are exploring the development of a world-first Infinity  Train which would use gravitational energy to recharge its  battery electric systems without any additional charging  requirements. Studies into the Infinity Train are ongoing. Zero-emission shipping In FY23, the shipping of our products from Western Australia  to Fortescue’s customers  accounted for approximately   3.04 million tonnes of CO2-eq, of which 0.26 million tonnes  were Scope 1 emissions from our large ore carriers (VLOCs)  under Fortescue's operational control in Port Hedland. These  emissions are the focus of this workstream. The remaining 2.78 million tonnes CO2-eq were from  chartered vessels (Scope 3). In FY23, we completed a dry dock maintenance cycle for our  eight VLOCs, which included installing variable frequency  drives and propeller caps, among other measures. These  energy saving devices have delivered initial reductions of  between 5-10% of Scope 1 shipping emissions. In FY23, we delivered a Fortescue-developed dual-fuel  ammonia-powered locomotive prototype to Solomon to  undergo field tests and mainline trials and continued to  develop a prototype dual-fuel four-stroke diesel ship engine  to run on ammonia. Later this year, it will undergo its first sea  trials onboard the 75-metre Green Pioneer. In FY24, the zero-emission shipping workstream will also  evaluate the option to convert our eight VLOCs to run on  green ammonia. We hope that by developing this technology  for our own fleet, it will encourage its adoption in our Scope 3  shipping fleet. We continue to support the International Maritime  Organisation’s (IMO) targets and engage with industry to  support the Australian Government’s representation on the  IMO Marine Environment Protection Committee.  ===== PAGE 24 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT    |    22 Our strategy CASE STUDY In January 2023, Fortescue’s decarbonisation progress  took a major step forward, with Fortescue WAE  completing and delivering to Australia the largest  battery of its kind, ready to be installed in a prototype  battery electric mining haul truck.  The 1.4MWh prototype power system sets the pace  for ground-breaking innovation in heavy industry  and is a bespoke design intended for integration  into a 240-tonne mining haul truck. In June 2023, the  prototype truck, Roadrunner, arrived on site in the  Pilbara for field testing.  Battery systems will be integral to Fortescue’s  decarbonisation plan, which includes replacing its  existing diesel-fuelled fleet with zero emission haul  trucks.  The battery will be integral to Fortescue’s  decarbonisation plan to help eliminate fossil fuels from  its terrestrial Australian iron ore operations, which  includes replacing its existing diesel-fuelled fleet with  battery electric and green hydrogen powered haul  trucks.  It was a massive achievement that was completed in  record time and marks several firsts for an electric  mining haul truck battery, with the ability to fast-charge  in 30 minutes and capacity to regenerate power as it  drives downhill. “For me, the highlight was working collaboratively with  our global team, especially the Battery Technicians.  Being surrounded by competent, like-minded  individuals like those in the battery build workshop,  and returning as one of Fortescue Energy’s first Battery  Technicians, was one of the most rewarding experiences  of my life.” –   Alex Schubach, Electrical Supervisor – Compliance  “Our goal was to gain the knowledge and skills to  construct, commission and maintain the battery  subpacks at Hazelmere and Christmas Creek. I can  confidently say we achieved these goals, assisting  with the completion of the eight subpacks for Project  Roadrunner, and being signed off as a competent  Battery Technician. I’m honoured to have represented  Fortescue overseas and I’m excited for what’s to come.”  – Jayden Prosser, HME Electrician Experienced. FORTESCUE  WAE   ===== PAGE 25 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT    |    23 Our targets Our strategy Governance Industry and research partners Overview Managing risk Renewable energy In FY23, Fortescue completed construction of the  transmission lines for the Pilbara Energy Connect project,  connecting Solomon to Iron Bridge and Port Hedland. In  addition, the Board approved an investment of US$373  million to connect Eliwana, Cloudbreak and Christmas Creek,  which is forecast to be complete by FY25/26. Construction progressed on Fortescue’s 100MW solar  farm at North Star Junction, located near Iron Bridge,  which is expected to be operational by early FY25. Once  commissioned, North Star's renewable energy will provide  up to 30% of our Pilbara daytime stationary energy needs.  North Star will complement the 60MW solar farm  commissioned in 2021 as part of the Chichester Solar Gas  Hybrid Project, which provides up to 100% of Christmas  Creek’s and Cloudbreak’s daytime energy needs and  displaces around 100 million litres of diesel every year.  In FY23, Fortescue developed and refined energy modelling  software to understand how to optimise our Pilbara iron  ore operations when powered by renewable energy rather  than fossil fuels. This model will continue to inform our  understanding of Fortescue’s needs for renewable energy  infrastructure and battery storage. We also investigated  various technology options to provide optimal long-duration  renewable energy storage solutions.  As a result of this modelling work, Fortescue anticipates we  will need 2-3GW of renewable energy and battery storage as  part of our plan to eliminate fossil fuels from our Australian  iron ore operations. Feasibility studies are underway for  proposed wind and solar generation sites. In FY23, we  continued to work with community stakeholders for approval  pathways for these projects and anticipate they will be ready  for Final Investment Decision progressively over FY24, FY25  and FY26. A priority in FY23 has been working to enable future digital  control systems to be decarbonisation-ready. For example  the ability to use forecast variability in upcoming weather  data to optimise both short and long-term planning across  our iron ore operations. In FY24, we anticipate seeing  the designs finalised and the commencement of system  upgrades across the whole iron ore value chain. In FY23, Fortescue also upgraded the Solomon Power  Station to provide 290MW of additional gas-powered  capacity into the network. It will provide firming energy as we  transition to a fully renewable energy network.  CASE STUDY Fortescue’s people are at the heart of our  decarbonisation strategy. Our people are designing,  building, constructing and operating towards our  decarbonised future. Our people and their drive, skills  and commitment to living the Values, will help us  achieve our Real Zero plans by 2030. In FY23 we undertook some high-level work to  understand what our operational workforce of the  future will look like, and what skills we will need to be  successful. Our goal is for our workforce to have a  smooth and well-timed transition to our decarbonised  future. Key future skills identified included:   •	 Electrician skills •	 Battery maintenance skills  •	 Electrical engineering skills •	 Cable management skills While the coal industry has had cabled, electrified  mining equipment for some time, it is a new capability  for Fortescue. Fortescue is due to receive its first three  electric excavators in FY24 and is establishing cable  management capabilities, now in preparation.   We are confident that with the right investment in  professional, trade and training pathways, we will  create many opportunities for up and cross-skilling of  our existing workforce.   People who will be well primed for our workforce of  2030 are in high school, TAFE or university now. We are  investing through our Next Gen program to help our  future workforce to understand the choices they will  have in our decarbonised future.     PEOPLE DEVELOPMENT   ===== PAGE 26 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT    |    24 Our strategy Decarbonising our value chain Reducing emissions in our value chain requires Fortescue  to address downstream emissions from iron and steel  customers and upstream emissions from our supply chain.  During FY23, 192 million tonnes of Fortescue’s iron ore was  shipped globally to our customers. Downstream emissions (our customers) To meet our targets of Net Zero Scope 3 emissions by 2040  and a 7.5% reduction in steelmaking emissions intensity by  2030 relative to FY21 levels, Fortescue is conducting R&D  both inhouse and in collaboration with steel mill businesses,  global engineering companies and research institutions.  In FY23, Fortescue achieved the following milestones: • 	 We developed a pilot installation capable of converting  iron ore to green iron without coal, with several patent  applications filed. The process uses low-temperature  electrolysis, which can be powered using renewable  electricity and offers a potential pathway to enable the full  spectrum of Fortescue's iron ore products to be converted  into green iron. • 	 Signed a joint Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)   with Primetals Technologies and Voestalpine to jointly  study a new green ironmaking process using hydrogen  and Fortescue’s Pilbara ores. •	 Signed an MoU with China Baowu, the world’s biggest  steelmaker, to explore development of new iron making  technologies at one of China Baowu’s operations, using  Fortescue iron ore and green hydrogen. • 	 Delivered Iron Bridge’s first magnetite product, with  nameplate capacity of 22 million tonnes per annum. The  use of high-grade magnetite concentrate, to produce  pellets for use in direct reduction furnaces, enables  shipping a higher concentration of ore.  In FY24, we are progressing a study on an investment to  produce green iron at the Boodarie Strategic Industrial Area  in Port Hedland.  Upstream emissions (our supply chain) In FY23, we established a dedicated team within  Procurement and Logistics to identify and progress  decarbonisation opportunities within our upstream supply  chain. The Decarbonisation team is also responsible for  integrating climate change requirements into Fortescue’s  source-to-contract process and building internal capability  to support our decarbonisation program.  We delivered foundational training to 112 employees  outlining climate change basics, emissions accounting,  sustainability risks and practical application of  decarbonisation of Procurement and Logistics, including  Category Management and Procurement Services teams.  Sustainable Procurement completed an assessment of the  decarbonisation sourcing activity pipeline for sustainability  risks. We introduced heightened due diligence requirements  for renewables-related workstreams and delivered training  to our Category Management teams. We continued to develop greenhouse gas-specific  contractual clauses and tender schedules whilst seeking  feedback from key suppliers and our peers. In April 2023,  representatives from Fortescue’s senior leadership team  hosted a Contractor Forum to present our decarbonisation  program and supplier expectations to 21 key suppliers,  including four Australian First Nations-owned businesses.  We commenced an emissions mapping case study  in collaboration with a critical supplier to develop our  emissions accounting through two-way supply chain  transparency and applying life cycle assessment principles.  With learnings from this project, the Decarbonisation  team are working with our Sustainability team to evaluate  technology solutions for collecting and managing supplier  emissions data. We expect to release the outcome of this  case study in our FY24 Sustainability report.  The Decarbonisation team will continue to embed  sustainability requirements into existing procurement  processes and will prioritise working with suppliers to  improve emissions reporting accuracy.  ===== PAGE 27 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT    |    25 Our targets Our strategy Governance Industry and research partners Overview Managing risk Fortescue Energy Fortescue Energy’s focus is on working to produce  commercial scales of technology, renewable electricity  and green hydrogen, including derivatives such as green  ammonia, to accelerate global decarbonisation of heavy  industry, aviation, shipping and fertilisers.  In FY23, Fortescue Energy has a target to bring up to five  projects to Final Investment Decision. Currently our focus is on five key regions:  •	 USA. Across the US, we are actively developing several  potential green hydrogen projects including near Phoenix,  Arizona •	 Australia. A proposed 550MW green hydrogen facility,  and with Incitec Pivot Limited, a proposed green ammonia  facility. Both are currently in the front-end engineering  design (FEED) stage at Gibson Island •	 Kenya. A proposed, up to 300MW, geothermal steam-to- fertiliser facility in the Olkaria region is currently in the   pre-feasibility stage. The project is aimed at the  production of green ammonia for domestic use in Kenya,  with the Government of Kenya as the sole off-taker •	 Norway. A proposed 300MW green ammonia facility  is currently in the pre-feasibility stage, with renewable  energy secured via a long-term conditional Power  Purchase Agreement with Statkraft to support our  operational plans •	 Brazil. A proposed green hydrogen and green ammonia  facility at the Port of Pecem, Ceará is in the pre-feasibility  stage Fortescue Energy’s progress in FY23 In FY23, Fortescue Energy achieved a key milestone with  the construction and handover of the Gladstone Electrolyser  Manufacturing (GEM) Centre in March. Further fit out of the  facility, including the automated production line and testing  facilities, has now started. Fortescue Energy also announced a partnership with the  U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy  Laboratory to advance green hydrogen production and  technologies. The collaboration has the potential to create  more than 350 research, engineering and management  jobs. Combined with the impact of the Inflation Reduction  Act (IRA), this investment is expected to catalyse a strong  increase in manufacturing in the USA’s renewable energy  ecosystem. In FY23, we completed our R&D Perth Technology Innovation  Centre and opened the Colorado Technology Innovation  Centre in the USA, which will tap into the US talent pool and  innovation ecosystem.   With a consortium of partners, Fortescue Energy also  commenced the development of an ammonia cracker  prototype to extract green hydrogen from green ammonia  at industrial scale. The system will be designed to deliver  high-purity green hydrogen, suitable for Polymer Electrolyte  Membrane fuel cell use, using the Metal Membrane  Technology purification process, which was developed in  partnership with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial  Research Organisation.  In FY23, Fortescue WAE announced plans to expand its  operations to two new facilities in the United Kingdom, one  in Kidlington and the other in Banbury. The Kidlington facility  will focus on prototype development of power systems for  multiple green mobility applications. The Banbury facility will  focus on manufacturing heavy industry, battery modules and  fully assembled power systems.  ===== PAGE 28 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT    |    26 Our strategy DECARBONISING AND TRANSFORMING FOOD  SECURITY IN KENYA CASE STUDY CASE STUDY In FY23, we secured renewable power for the proposed  Holmaneset green energy project by entering into a  long-term Power Purchase Agreement with Statkraft.  The conditional agreement will see Statkraft supply  renewable power to support our operational plans for a  300MW green hydrogen and green ammonia facility.  Norway has significant potential to lead the way for  green hydrogen and green ammonia production, based  on availability of renewable energy, proximity to the  European market and access to a skilled workforce. In  partnership with local Norwegian consultants, Fortescue  has completed a Scoping Study to identify potential  locations for production of green hydrogen and ammonia  and is now in the pre-feasibility stage. Consideration has  been given to a range of factors, such as existing grid  and power capacity, proximity to existing infrastructure,  land availability, water sources, topography and the local  environment and surrounding communities. The proposed Holmaneset Project seeks to utilise  surplus renewable energy to power an integrated green  hydrogen and green ammonia process plant, complete  with transmission infrastructure and port facilities, for  transport to the Norwegian and European markets. The  proposed site is located on the coast of the Nordgulen  fjord, approximately eight kilometres west of Svelgen in  the Bremanger Municipality in western Norway. Green industry development is a priority for Norway  and Europe. The Norwegian Government’s Hydrogen  Strategy (2020) emphasises both the national and  international importance for the kind of production that   is planned at Holmaneset. The Government of Kenya and Fortescue Energy are  moving forward on a proposed development of a major  green energy and fertiliser project, which will help Kenya  to step beyond fossil fuels. The proposed green ammonia and fertiliser facility is  expected to have a capacity of up to 300MW and will be  located in the Naivasha vicinity of the Olkaria geothermal  field. The scope of work also includes an intention to supply  green electricity to Kenya’s grid. Most recently Fortescue and Kenya signed an Investment  Support and Implementation Agreement, which builds  on and accelerates the Framework Agreement signed  during COP27. It outlines a commercial framework for the project,  including government support for critical resources,  infrastructure and off-take. Kenya has created significant momentum towards  establishing itself as a world leader in the production of  fertiliser made using green ammonia. This project has the potential to provide Kenya with  additional energy security that steps beyond the use of  fossil fuels, and more importantly, could help reduce a  reliance on Russian imported fertiliser.  This partnership sets Kenya on a path to industrial  decarbonisation and will see Fortescue join Kenya on   that journey.

These programs, guided by our existing Social Investment  Framework, ensure investment is aligned with our business  objectives, our sustainability strategy and the United Nations  Sustainable Development Goals. As we transition to a low  carbon world there will be challenges for some communities  and we aim to engage with and support these communities.  As part of this transition, new jobs will be created and others  will evolve. We have developed a green energy workforce forecasting  tool and skills database and have mapped the shortest  training pathways to create local green energy jobs and  training to help enable a just transition.   We are using this information to work with governments,  academia, community, and other industry to develop  curriculum.  Fortescue recognises that pathways to  employment and training are most effective when they  are introduced at the primary and secondary school level.  We have developed a Green Energy Education program,  designed to engage school students in the call for action on  climate change and stimulate interest in green jobs.   In Kenya, Fortescue is working with academic institutions to  help ensure benefits of the just transition accrue via: •	 Local workforce development and training •	 Use of local goods and services •	 Industrial development, capacity, and competency  building. Fortescue has established a partnership with Strathmore  University (Kenya), to support the development of Africa’s  first Post Graduate Diploma in Green Energy Operations  in conjunction with Curtin University (Australia). Fortescue  conducts these activities within the context of ensuring  respect for human rights and eradicating modern slavery.

It emphasises the collective responsibility of  management, employees and contractors to be aware of  the risks related to their activities and to be accountable  for ensuring those risks are effectively managed and  transparently reported.  Our approach to climate-related risks and opportunities is  developed in response to the Taskforce on Climate-related  Disclosures (TCFD) and the Taskforce on Nature-related  Disclosures (TNFD)’s three focus areas:  •	 Transition risk – risk arising from the need to decarbonise  the global economy  •	 Physical risk – risk arising from the physical impacts of  climate change •	 Nature risk – risk arising from humanity’s impacts on  biodiversity and ecosystem function and our reliance on  natural systems to survive. Some of the key components of our risk management  framework are:    • 	 Applying a structured approach to risk management  • 	 Using outcomes of risk assessments to drive actions that  mitigate risks   • 	 Maintaining a strong focus on the resilience of our  business through a reliance on effective recovery plans for  material adverse events  • 	 Reporting regularly to the Executive team and the Board  on the outcomes of risk management activities  • 	 Holding our CEOs accountable to the Board for ensuring  risk is appropriately managed, including risks related to  climate change.  04  ===== PAGE 31 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT    |    29 Our targets Our strategy Governance Industry and research partners Overview Managing risk The following steps are taken when considering climate  change risk:  •	 Risk identification: The Sustainability team engages  with relevant stakeholders to identify risks related to  climate change across the business value chain in  the short, medium, and long-term. In FY23 we also  engaged specialist climate scientists to assist with risk  identification.  •	 Risk assessment: Each risk is analysed against criteria for  consequence and likelihood. We review relevant climate  models and in FY23 used qualitative assessments to  understand the transition, physical and nature impacts to  Fortescue.  •	 Response: Options for managing each risk include  accepting the risk, avoiding the risk, transferring the  risk or mitigating the risk. When reviewing controls for  mitigating risks, their effectiveness is evaluated in the light  of Fortescue’s risk appetite.  •	 Monitoring: The ARMSC and the Board receive updates on  progress managing High and Extreme risks. Fortescue’s  CFO chairs the Decarbonisation Strategy Committee,  which meets at least five times each year and reviews  progress. Transition risks To improve our understanding of the impact of climate  change on Fortescue we have stress tested the resilience of  our business strategy under different emissions scenarios.  Last year, we reported on the Intergovernmental Panel on  Climate Change’s (IPCC’s) “Unified Global Action” scenario,  the “Two-speed Transition” scenario and the “Stall and  Shock” scenario. See FY22 Climate Change Report. In FY23, we also examined three further IPCC low-emission  Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) in 2030 and  in 2040. For the analysis of climate-related risks and  opportunities relating to the transition to a low-carbon  economy, we looked at risks and opportunities that could  arise from: •	 Demand fluctuation for products •	 Technical viability of decarbonisation •	 Policy and Regulatory change •	 Reputational damage.  SSP1/RCP*1.9: A very low emission scenario, assuming rapid  decarbonisation and strong mitigation efforts with strong  global cooperation SSP2/RCP*2.6: A relatively low emission scenario, assuming  moderate population growth, a mix of environmental policies  and medium levels of economic development with levels  proceeding unevenly across countries SSP5/RCP*2.6: A relatively low emission scenario,  associated with continued demand growth for metals,  high energy demand and high economic growth. It  assumes fragmented governance structures and limited  environmental regulations. Demand for our commodities Our scenario analysis concentrates on risks and  opportunities arising from changes in demand of iron ore  and hydrogen. This analysis specifically focused on three key  export regions: China, the EU28⁸ and the United States. Under these scenarios we see the potential demand for iron  ore and hydrogen fluctuate, but we consider that our early  diversification puts us in a reasonable position in all these  scenarios as an early mover on decarbonising our iron ore  operations and the establishment of Fortescue Energy. In FY24, we will undertake further work to improve the  relevance of the scenario analysis to our business model.  Technical viability of decarbonisation  We accept that there are, and will be in the future,  technical challenges related to decarbonisation. As part  of addressing these challenges, existing technology will  need to be adapted and applied in new ways, and entirely  new technology will also need to be developed. Technology  availability (including supply chain availability of relevant  goods and services) and technology maturity are therefore  key issues. This is all part of our challenge as first movers.  We aim to address some of this risk as detailed in the section  “Our Strategy”.  We consider that early diversification via Fortescue Energy  will be advantageous as our pipeline of green hydrogen  and ammonia projects; battery manufacture; electrolyser  production; and zero emissions fleet and shipping  innovation; all align to identified gaps in the International  Energy Agency Net Zero Emissions 2050 (NZE2050)  technology pathways.   ⁸ EU28 refers to all the member states of the European Union from the accession of Croatia in 2013 to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom in 2020 * RCP = Representative concentration pathways   ===== PAGE 32 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT    |    30 Managing risk Regulatory and policy risk  We consider these low emissions scenarios are important  in transition planning as they require us to assume that  companies and governments must decarbonise quickly and  therefore takes into account the increased risk of market and  policy change as a result of moving rapidly.  Regulatory change is a material risk for Fortescue. Abrupt  changes in policy settings and uncertainty about policy  settings can lower the value of assets and businesses, leaving  some economically unviable or “stranded.”  Fortescue closely monitors regulatory developments globally  as interest in and understanding of climate change across  governments and regulatory bodies increases.  Our resilience to policy changes is also expected to improve  in certain areas. For example,  the need to purchase  mandatory credits under Australia’s Safeguard Mechanism  is expected to decrease as we work to decarbonise our  operations. Similarly, our financial obligations in relation  to carbon border taxes such as the EU Carbon Border  Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) are expected to decrease  as the carbon emissions associated with our commodities  decrease.  In FY23 there was significant climate regulatory change  across the world, including the introduction of economic  incentives such as the USA’s IRA and Australia’s Hydrogen  Headstart government package, which is earmarked for  green (not fossil fuel) hydrogen production. Fortescue Energy  has accordingly focussed on identifying projects to develop  where these global economic incentives are emerging. Reputational risks According to the TCFD, reputation is one of the key climate  related risks. Failure to decarbonise carries significant  reputational risks and there are also growing expectations for  responsible conduct from stakeholders, including investors,  lenders and consumers. Decarbonisation also represents an  opportunity to enhance reputation and brand value. Investor interest in sustainability, including climate change,  continues to grow. We value opportunities to better  understand the interests and concerns of our investors and  are committed to ongoing engagement. This year there was particular focus on our industry-leading  decarbonisation plan, emission reduction targets, Fortescue  Energy projects and our Sustainability Financing Framework.  Fortescue remains committed to sustainability in all aspects of  our business. Core to our capital structure is our Sustainable  Financing Framework, enabling the issuance of Green Bonds or  Loans. This Framework was used in our inaugural Green Bond  in April 2022 and we continue to allocate eligible projects  under this Framework. FY23 Projects included the Pilbara  Energy Connect Project (solar generation and a portion of  transmission), the Green Fleet Energy Hub and spend on  battery electric locomotives (disclosed page 46 of our FY23  Annual Report). Total allocated in FY23 was US$109m. Further  reporting is disclosed within the Group's annual report.  Physical risks  Physical risk reflects how changes to the frequency and  intensity of extreme and ongoing weather can impact,  disrupt and damage business operations, assets and  supply chains, as well as lead to broader impacts such as  environmental stress, food and water security and trends in  migration.  The TCFD distinguishes between the following physical  climate risks:  • 	 Acute risks – A change in the frequency and/or intensity  of extreme weather events, for example cyclones or floods.  • 	 Chronic risks – Longer-term shifts in climate patterns, for  example sustained higher temperatures, lower rainfall and  a rise in sea level.  Physical impacts from climate change are inevitable  however, the extent of those impacts and the rate at  which they occur will depend on how quickly the world  decarbonises. Results of our qualitative work on scenario modelling  demonstrate that, under climate change, Fortescue’s Pilbara  operations will be directly impacted by an increase in the  intensity of extreme heat, rain, drought and water scarcity.  Extreme heat can lead to heat stress and exposure  to dangerous heat-humidity levels, while reduced  aquifer recharge and water availability could impact ore  beneficiation and dust suppression. Additionally, cyclones,  flooding events, sea level rise and storm surge events could  affect Fortescue’s value chain. These events could also  damage ports, make critical transport routes inaccessible  and cause power outages. Fortescue is building its  capabilities to respond to the rapid climate change extremes  that are emerging as global temperatures rise.  The risks identified in our FY22 Climate Change report  remain:  • Acute: Increased severity of extreme weather event  • Acute: Increased frequency of extreme heat  • Chronic: Rising sea level and storm surge inundation  • Chronic: Changes in precipitation patterns  In FY23 we examined those climate change risks through  the geographical lens of material climate hazards and  impacts on our business and value chain. We are currently  considering how the outputs of this work will inform the next  phase of our physical climate risk assessments.  Along with key stakeholders, we considered climate  exposure by 2030 and 2050 for our main operations in  Australia, as well as key export countries. We examined a  low, moderate and high emission scenario, corresponding to  temperature increases of 1.5˚C, 2˚C to 3˚C, and over 4˚C by  2100. Physical and transition risks were treated differently  in order to understand the extremes when we design our  infrastructure.   ===== PAGE 33 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT    |    31 Our targets Our strategy Governance Industry and research partners Overview Managing risk HAZARD IMPACT ASSESSMENT Acute: Extreme heat We assess the frequency of hot days over 35⁰C and the hottest annual temperature.  Rising temperatures are associated with increased heatwaves and risk of wildfire events. Prolonged exposure to hotter temperatures can have a significant impact on the health  and safety of workers. The addition of humidity exacerbates heat stress for outdoor  workers. Shift schedules may have to be adjusted to maintain safe working conditions and  labour productivity may be impacted during heatwaves.  Extreme heat also impacts infrastructure. Equipment, including energy infrastructure, is  susceptible to overheating leading to reduced power generation capacity. Heatwaves can  also impact train networks through rail buckling. Finally, increased energy demand for air  conditioning can increase operational costs. Acute: Severe Weather We assess the frequency and intensity of severe weather events. These events include  tropical cyclones, hurricanes and typhoons. Climate change is likely to change the severity  of these weather systems. Risks associated with extreme wind events include damage to mine sites and connecting  infrastructure. This often leads to port closures and evacuation of ships, disrupting freight  schedules. Severe weather can also drive up capital costs through asset repair costs and  higher insurance premiums. Additionally, power outages are regularly caused by wind storms when the energy grid is  connected by overhead power lines which are prone to being blown over.  Extreme events can damage ecosystems, leading to restrictions to operate within affected  habitats and limitations on project expansions. This in turn can lead to project delays and  reduced production rates. Acute: Extreme Rain We assess extreme rain intensity and frequency. The link between climate change and  extreme rain is complex and not linear. Nonetheless, as a rule, a warmer atmosphere holds  more moisture which increases the risk of heavy rainfall events that may result in flooding. Extreme rainfall events can lead to extensive damage, for example through flash floods  impacting facilities and equipment. They can also result in overtopping of water storages  and disrupt critical transportation between Fortescue’s sites. Extreme rain events increase  the risk of landslides and erosion and may increase insurance premiums in high risk areas. Flooding events can lead to operational disruptions and delays to projects due to unsafe  working conditions and temporary site closures. Finally, stagnant water following floods  may also lead to a rise in vector-borne diseases. A summary of the physical hazards and impacts assessed is found in the table below. Climate change physical hazards and impacts  ===== PAGE 34 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT    |    32 Managing risk HAZARD IMPACT ASSESSMENT Chronic: Long term  Precipitation We assess total annual rainfall and dry spells. Changes in rainfall patterns, along with  chronic temperature rise and extreme heat, contribute to vegetation curing as landscapes  dry out in the absence of rainfall, which in turn affects water availability and heightened  dust risk. Droughts contribute to ecosystem decline and diminished aquifer recharge. Gaining  approvals and licenses for current projects and future expansions may become more  difficult as a result, leading to project delays and reduced revenue. The iron ore and hydrogen supply chains require substantial amounts of water for ore  beneficiation and dust suppression. Reduced availability of water would impact these  operations. Water stress can also lead to a tension in the relationship with community stakeholders  and increased water costs. Chronic: Sea Level Rise We assess future sea level rise and frequency of storm surge events. Rising  temperatures contribute to sea  level rise through melting of ice and thermal expansion of  seawater. Gradual sea level rise is the primary driver of projected changes in extreme sea  levels and associated coastal inundation risk. Extreme storm surge events can lead to damage to port infrastructure and vessels, cause  temporary site closures and lead to operational disruptions, delay freight schedules and  cause broader value chain disruptions. Extreme storm surge events can also result in a loss of product or reduce product quality  and value. Finally, these events can drive up impact insurance costs, or make certain  assets, products or services uninsurable. Our next step is to conduct a quantitative climate risk  assessment to understand specific vulnerabilities of our  assets (railways, tailings storage facilities, power grids,  groundwater abstraction infrastructure, port operations)  to key climatic variables and the constraints on our current  methods of management. This exercise will integrate finer- scale climate data with Fortescue's own data to produce  business-specific insights and recommendations for the  Fortescue Risk Management Framework. This process will  continue to inform how we engineer our future designs in the  Pilbara and will inform how we design our global designs for  climate resilience.   High and extreme climate risks will be reported to the Audit,  Risk Management and Sustainability Committee (ARMSC)  and the Board. Nature  In FY23, we commenced the first stage of the TNFD in  mapping our key interfaces and dependencies on nature  to understand the material nature-related risks and  opportunities to our core businesses. We have commenced  three TNFD pilot studies that consider our existing  operations in the Pilbara and two other sites from our future  mining and energy portfolios. The outcome of the pilot  studies will inform our disclosures and our risk-related  response to identify focus areas for climate and ecosystem  resilience. We will update our pilot studies in the FY24 report  and commit to full TNFD reporting in FY25.  ===== PAGE 35 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT    |    33 Our targets Our strategy Governance Industry and research partners Overview Managing risk 05 GOVERNANCE Good corporate governance is critical to the long-term,   sustainable success of Fortescue Our Board is responsible for the oversight of all sustainability  matters, including climate change, receiving regular udpates  through the ARMSC.

The partners came  together to produce an ammonia cracker prototype to  produce green hydrogen at scale. Siemens Energy and Fortescue are providing  engineering expertise and innovative technical  solutions.   GeoPura will provide on site management and as the  off taker, will be taking the hydrogen product from the  prototype ammonia cracker system for use in their  innovative fuel cell power generation technology.  GeoPura plans to use this hydrogen to supply Hydrogen  Power Units (HPUs). HPUs are used as a replacement  for heavy polluting diesel generators as an ‘off-grid’  solution to provide zero emission power to a wide range  of industries including TV production, such Netflix and  BBC’s Winterwatch and construction projects, including  HS2, Britain’s new high speed rail line.  “The research and development of technology like this  is key to the success of green hydrogen globally. There  is an overwhelming demand for the supply of green  hydrogen, particularly in Europe, and transport is central  to ensuring that supply. We know that green hydrogen  can be transported long distances as green ammonia,  and if successful, ammonia cracking coupled with Metal  Membrane Technology means that you can convert it as  you need to, at the point of use.” Fortescue Energy CEO Mark Hutchinson INDUSTRY COLLABORATION BETWEEN SIEMENS ENERGY, SIEMENS ENERGY VENTURES, FORTESCUE ENERGY, GEOPURA, AND INNOVATE UK  ===== PAGE 39 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT    |    37 Our targets Our strategy Governance Industry and research partners Overview Managing risk Agreements and partnerships with a focus on climate change ORGANISATION JURISDICTION PURPOSE ENGAGEMENT Selection of agreements and partnerships (focus: climate and human rights action) Arctic Circle  Foundation Inc Iceland,  International Icelandic non-profit.

HME Heavy Mobile Equipment, such as diggers, excavators and drilling units Green Ammonia Ammonia is widely used to make fertiliser, but most ammonia today is made from fossil  fuels. Green ammonia, in contrast, is 100% renewable. One way to make green ammonia is  via the Haber Bosch process. Green hydrogen and nitrogen that has been extracted from  the air are reacted together during a process powered by renewable electricity to produce  green ammonia, or NH3. Green Hydrogen Green hydrogen is hydrogen produced via electrolysis of water in a process powered by  renewable electricity. Electrolysis splits the water molecule into its constituents, hydrogen and  oxygen.  Green Iron Iron ore that has been converted into iron (a) without the use of coal or any other fossil fuel  and (b) using renewable electricity and, in some cases, green hydrogen. Green Metals Metals that have been extracted from the ground without the use of fossil fuels during the  extraction process. Specifically, this means using haul trucks, drills, excavators and other  equipment that runs on battery-electric (charged by renewable electricity) or green  hydrogen- based technologies. Green Shipping Fuels Fuels used for shipping which are made without using fossil fuels. These include   green ammonia. Green Steel Steel made using green iron, powered by 100% renewable energy. GW Giga watt, or 1,000,000,000 watts GWh Giga watt hours MW Mega watt, or 1,000,000 watts SBTi Science Based Targets Initiative Scope 1 emissions Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions that are from sources owned or controlled   by an entity. Scope 2 emissions Scope 2 refers to emissions associated with the production of electricity, heat, or steam  purchased by an entity. Scope 3 emissions Scope 3 refers to all other indirect emissions associated with activities or facilities not  owned or controlled by the entity. Sustainable Aviation  Fuels (SAFs) A wide range of aviation fuels including biofuels (e.g. waste cooking oil), hydrogen and  synthetic hydrocarbons. Not all SAFs are sustainable or zero-emission fuels. TCFD The Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, which the Financial Stability Board  established to develop recommendations for more effective climate-related disclosures   that enable a better understanding of carbon related assets and exposures to   climate-related risks. Zero emissions When used in relation to vehicles, means no greenhouse gas emissions are emitted from the  vehicle’s exhaust when in operation. When used in relation to fuels, means no greenhouse has  emissions are emitted when the fuel is combusted. Glossary  ===== PAGE 47 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT    |    45 Our targets Our strategy Governance Industry and research partners Overview Managing risk SHIPPING EMISSIONS   METHODOLOGY CHANGE  In FY23, we revised the methodologies used to estimate  shipping to provide more accurate data on our shipping  emissions. To do this, we made two important changes. First, we used our actual fuel data in FY23 in our fuel  calculations for shipping. In previous years, we had used  industry benchmarks for fuel calculations. We also used our  actual fuel data to revise and restate our FY22 and   FY21 shipping emission calculations.  Second, we committed to have our emission reduction  targets verified through the SBTi. We adopted SBTi  methodologies for our FY23 calculations and revised our  FY22 and FY21 calculations in line with these methodologies.  The adjusted calculations are consistent with the  Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain  (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard and  have been independently assured. Details of the methodology used to estimate our   Scope 3 emissions can be found on our website at  Fortescue.com  ===== PAGE 48 ===== FORTESCUE  FY23 CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT    |    46 Industry and research partners Our report contains certain statements which may constitute  “forward-looking statements”.
